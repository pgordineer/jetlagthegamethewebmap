welcome to episode six of our race to claim
the most countries in Europe. Right now, our opponents,
Ben and Adam, have seven countries: France, Switzerland,
Liechtenstein, Germany, Austria, Italy,
and the Vatican City. My partner, Tom and I are in the lead
with eight countries: Belgium, the Netherlands,
Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia, Denmark,
Sweden, and Finland, which we're about to try to lock by recreating the first level
of Angry Birds. While we are in the lead,
we're feeling pretty nervous because we failed our attempts
to lock Denmark and Sweden, meaning they're vulnerable
to being stolen by Ben and Adam, which is exactly what Ben and Adam
are trying to do right now. They just arrived in Malmö, Sweden
and opened the Sweden challenge to buy a DJUNGELSKOG at IKEA, but without looking up
what a DJUNGELSKOG is. Tom and I thought this was great because we believed Ben and Adam
didn't have enough time left before the rest period
starts at 5:30 to get to IKEA and search. But Ben and Adam
managed to find a train that would get them there. And right now,
they're running for it. 1A, over here, over here,
over here, over here. Amy, we're gonna get
you that ""junkle-skok"" or whatever it's called. What is that? That doesn't seem right. Malmö. Okay. 1B. (bleep), it was 1B. Can we get to 1B? 1B? Go, go to 1B! Go to 1B! Hell yeah. (exhales loudly) So this is good
because we'll get there... with exactly 25 minutes
left in the day. Great.
So we'll be able to do— We'll have the full time. How the hell will
we find a DJUNGELSKOG? (sighs) I don't know. They've got...
less than an hour. They won't make it
all the way to IKEA. Are you sure? Well, the fact that they
have to get all the way to IKEA and then they have to spend
25 minutes searching. Yeah, but if they
know what it is... Just out of interest... if you are at
Malmö Central station, and by public transport,
you want to get to IKEA Malmö, 'cause IKEA's are not normally
good for public transit. No, they're out there. Eh, it's 23 minutes. Well... It's 23 minutes, Sam. It's possible they
could get there, but... I think it's unlikely
they can get there with a full 25 minutes left. I think it's looking good, Tom.
Here's our shop. No, no, I'm not. If they've identified the bear, they can get a train...
Maybe. They can peg it
through that IKEA, grab the bear.
Maybe. I think I might know
what a DJUNGELSKOG is. You think you do? I feel like it might be a giant stuffed bear. I bet you right now
that is the plush toy bear. Oh god.
Is it the plush toy bear? Yeah, you're right.
(sighs) That might be easy to guess. Yeah. (sighs) They do have those at IKEA. I could be— That's the type of thing
that she would... You know what I mean?
I could be wrong. But I feel like I've heard
that word before in wri— Sure.
I could be wrong. 'Cause a lot of
these Swedish words – Sound the same. But I do think that... Stupid stuff. It's not gonna be a
random piece of furniture. Probably.
Probably not. Maybe I don't know
what I'm talking about. But I feel like that's a
good starting place, right? Yeah. This feels achievable. My guess is that they didn't— It seems they didn't attempt this.
No. Decided that it
wasn't worth the time. So our theory was correct. Which means that
it was really smart of us to go here immediately. Right. If we had started
this in the morning... We would've been in
the same position they were. This is pretty IKEA esque.
It is. Boxes. Boxes. Yeah, okay, yep. Worth getting that
and some tape. Also, I wonder if anywhere
we could buy ping pong balls. Because the birds must be at least the size
of a ping pong ball. Yep.
Is there a sports shop? Oh, Sam.
Mhm? Resistance bands. Yeah. From a sports shop.
Yeah. We need something to
make the slingshot or... Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is there any tool that could... If you had a really wide wrench,
you could make a slingshot. Oh! That and
some rubber bands. Yeah. It's pretty good. Okay, let's go with that. Then let's go to the sports shop
and try and find balls. Oh, there's the toy shop. Oh.
Let's look for stuff in there. Thank you.
Thank you. These things
could technically work. These actually aren't bad.
Do they have a snout? They have a snout.
They have a snout. I mean, I think
that's our pig, Sam. Here is the ball section. What about tennis balls? Uhh, hello. Oh... are they smaller
than the plush? Yeah....?
Yes, yes they are. Tennis balls are a better shout. All rubber bands. Three—
light, medium, hard. Get a three pack. Okay. I mean, we're going
up to the checkout with resistance bands
and tennis balls, Sam. It's obvious we're up to mischief. Unless they already got to Malmö,
already pulled the challenge, or already on the way
to IKEA, Sam. There's no way. Uh-huh, they've
surprised us before. Look, I love your theory. I got nothing else. I love your theory. It's like, that word sounds
vaguely familiar to me. It makes sense to me that Amy would pick
the giant teddy bear. We need this. We really need this. Thank you.
Kiitos. Alright, where can
we do this, Sam, that's not absolutely freezing? Well... I don't know if
you're gonna find that in this country, but... Good point. Somewhere sheltered. Oh, hang on.
Here on the left. Welcome to
the Angry Birds dome. Stage one: construction. A little block there.
Watch out, that's unstable. Oh yeah, it is!
That's what we want, but— Oh no, hang on.
The slingshot must go side on. Does it?
It's a 2D game. (chuckles anxiously) Watch me rotate this
without it falling over. Oh, that's pretty
impressive, Tom. That is Angry Birds. I'm happy with that, Sam. Alright, how's the... How's our slingshot looking? Well, I'm just
trying to figure out the best way to construct
this, because... Okay. Oh, this might work actually. Just kind of hand hold.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll get you a tennis ball.
Hang on. Yeah, we might need
more slack. Eight feet away, which is... Well, I'll measure it. Eight feet. What's eight feet
in centimetres, Sam? I don't know.
Because I don't speak
your ridiculous units. It's like two point... Two and two thirds meters. Just here?
Mhm. That's two and a half metres. Okay, I think I've gotta try
to tape this on or something. Okay. Sam, I've only got a wide... I think they might have
gone for it. Well that's—
They'll have reduced odds if they go for it. They will have reduced odds. But I think they might
have gone for it. I don't hate reduced odds.
I don't hate reduced odds. 'Cause we really
want them to fail. Yeah, we do. Oh, they went for it! They went for it.
They went for it. Oh man. That's a lot. Oh, are they
at the IKEA already? Are they?
Yes. They're at the stop for the IKEA. How did they
get there that fast? Because they made
the correct connections at the right time.
Mm. Damn. There's the IKEA. Oh, there's a bridge
straight to the IKEA. I thought there was
a mistake for a second because I was like,
it's showing— it's saying we should just walk
directly across the highway, over a field to the IKEA. Let's walk directly
over the highway to the IKEA. Let's do it. DJUNGELSKOG, right? D-J-U-N. Okay, it's 5:02,
which is actually... Our train got in
several minutes late, so we might be... We might have a little
less than 25 minutes. We should... move a little bit. The Swedish teens
are laughing at us, Ben. Okay, okay. That's slingshotty.
(rubber stretching) Yeah, yeah.
It even makes the noise! Yeah, Sam, put a ball in it. Mm.
Hold on. Can I try a thing, Sam? I think it's how
you're letting it go. Okay, that's—
That's how we do it. Good news, I nearly hit it. Alright, practice,
practice, practice. Why do we get backspin? That's so tricky.
Yeah. Okay, that was good.
Never mind. That was good. Good.
Good. Good. That was good. What you do is you pull back, you angle up, you fire. Good. I'm impressed at how
good this aim is. You pull back,
you angle up, you fire. Nnngh. All we need is a one in three. Oh, well, and for
it to work when we hit. True. We should take
a test shot at it. Yeah, we definitely should.
If it doesn't knock it down... Definitely should. Whoa. That one completely backfired. Hey, Tom, on the bright side?
Yeah? They're not in the IKEA yet. And it's 6:06.
Alright. So they're reducing their odds And they are panicking.
...slightly. There's less than
25 minutes in the day. Oh god, this IKEA's three stories. Okay. Made it to IKEA. We're about two minutes late. So we only have
23 minutes to do this. Start the time.
Alright, here we go. Start looking.
There will be a map. We probably want to
get to children's IKEA. Let's try there first.
That's my best inkling. Okay. Let's try that first. This is not the actual thing. Stop the ball if you can, Sam.
Yeah. We're gonna do some practice shots.
But if you can't stop the ball, then we'll know if it works. You pull back, you angle up, you fire. That would've hit.
Yeah, not— I'm not sure if it has
enough force, but... Oh! That would've had—
That would've hit it. That would've had enough force.
Yeah. It was, you know...
The aim was not there, but... You pull back,
you angle up... and you fluff it. (inhales sharply) Mmh. I don't like the
pressure for this, Sam. Pull back, twice, up. Fi— no, nope. Pull back. No, I can tell that wasn't working. What's wrong here? I think we may need to
engineer a better slingshot. Yeah, I mean,
do you have thoughts on how to do that? Unfortunately not.
Mm-kay. Maybe if we make it
a bit looser? That...
See, that was good. Wasn't on target,
but it was good. Oh, we need beaks on these. Oh yeah.
Forgot the beaks. Yes!
Okay. Well, no, but also... Good aim. There we go. That's it. Alright, you build.
I'm gonna drill my shooting. Whoa! (laughs heartily) Sorry, Sam! Okay, that says ""Skog Duva"" which makes me think
that SKOGS is... Like plush.
Plush. Yeah.
So I really like that. ""Skog-duva"".
This all says SKOGS— But that all says SKOGS,
which I think is a really good sign that you could be right. Because it was
DJUNGELSKOG, right? Yep.
Okay, is it this way? Or is this... No, this was a maze. Okay, no, no, no.
This was wrong. What's the way outta here? I'm still just
looking at everything. That thing's plush. What is?
What's this called? BLÅVINGAD.
BLÅVINGAD. Let's just keep moving.
Children— I'm trying to check the signs.
No, I understand. I understand. ""Akrins"" AXSTAD. Bänkskivor. None of these things. None of these things. That's RÅSKOG. Wait, RÅSKOG? But that's like a... Okay, well I don't like
that piece of information. But let's just keep going. That was spot on! Sorry about that. Oh yes. Oh yes. Yeah. Sam, I'm getting this.
That's great. Sam, I'm starting
to dial this in. I knew it was good. I knew it was good
before it'd even left the slingshot. Alright, Tom.
Yeah? Let's consider
the next three a test. Yeah. Let's see if
you can get the spot in one of these three.
Alright. There we go.
That would've gotten it. Probably.
Borderline. There we go.
You got two out of three. I did. Let's keep going until
I get three in a row. Okay, this way. FAMNIG HJÄRTA. Okay, that's big heart. But we're still going. Okay, based on the map... we still got a ways to go. We're at three and
children's isn't until 10. Mhm.
One. Two in a row. Three in a row. That was a little too far left.
Alright. My aim's not great now. Sam, my hand's gonna get tired
if I keep doing this. I've locked it in. I think let's
practice it for real. 'Cause it's possible there are
certain shots that won't... Okay. I'm happy to keep
reconstructing it. Alright, so these are
live fire practices. Yeah. Alright, let's
make this your first. That would've gotten it.
That would've gotten it. But there were
multiple stuffed animals that said 'SKOG'. Right? What are these? DJUNGELSKOG.
Wait, what? These are DJUNGELSKOG? DJUNGELSKOG.
(wheezes) This—
Because it's a monkey. 'Cause it's a monkey. Because it's in the jungle!
Oh my god. DJUNGEL— It's a
SKOG from the jungle. It's a SKOG from the jungle.
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's send it to Amy.
Let's send it to Amy. Oh... my... god. Let's (bleep)-ing go. Ohh!
You wanna buy him? I'll take him on
the rest of our journey. Yeah, yeah. I think that
we should buy him for Amy. 'Cause she's— I know she said
we didn't have to bring it to her, but— We're gonna get her
her DJUNGELSKOG. Alright, wait, wait, wait. No, we gotta call Tom and Sam. Oh no. Oh no.
Oh. Are we getting the call?
We're getting the call. Oh no! It wasn't the bear.
It was the monkey. It's a DJUNGELSKOG.
Check out our DJUNGELSKOG. Yeah.
Yeah. Alright, you've stolen it.
Alright, we gotta go. We gotta go. Bye! Bye. Wow, that's absolutely huge stuff. Okay, well let's check out
and go get outside the IKEA. Wow. So that flips the score,
which was 8–7. Now it's 7–8. And they haven't
even locked Finland. And the day's almost over.
Yep. (growls) That puts the score
to 8–7 to them, Sam. Yeah. It's not great Tom, but... No it's not. Hopefully they
don't get Denmark and... Oh, I was feeling—
I thought— Yeah, so was I! Ugh. Mmmgh, just minutes. Minutes of—
Minutes. Alright, live fire
practice round two. This is your first
of three attempts. There we go— oh!
Not to the ground. Ah. There we go. Not to the—
Yes to the ground. Oh!
It's close. Nope, misfire. Hope you don't have the yips. Dunno what that means. But I do know
what that means. Nice. No. Boom.
There we go. If you wanna call it and go for it, 'cause you have the feel,
go for it. I think there's logic in
taking the time we have, but if you just feel
like you've got it and don't wanna mess it up more,
I understand. Also, hand and arm
are getting tired. It's up to you. Pressure's
gonna get to me, Sam. Pressure's gonna get to me. Let's do, I think
this is number seven. But you're well beyond
50% at this point. Little left. Little high. Well also... I just wanna imagine
that's Ben and Adam getting to IKEA, you know? Oh, that was good. It seems to help. Do you wanna go for it? We're going for it. Three shots to lock Finland. Three shots for glory. Gimme a bird. These are our beak ones. These have beaks, alright.
Let's hope that doesn't— I hope dry beaks
doesn't throw me off. Alright.
Right, aim. Aim. Aim.
For the glory, Tom. Ben and Adam—
No, that was not correct. Ben and Adam at IKEA. No! It's alright, Tom.
We got two more. Ball number two. I knew it was wrong
the minute it left my hand. Lock in. Lock in. Feel it out. Well, what I need to do
is just get angry! (sighs harshly) Stay calm. I don't think you need to get angry.
I think you need to stay calm. I'm not gonna lie.
It's not great. Oh. Call 'em. I hate that you're grinning.
I know why you're grinning. Because it's to throw them off.
But I hate that you're grinning. I'm grimacing. Oh. Oh, that's
also a DJUNGELSKOG. Oh, maybe they're all DJUNGELSKOG.
'Cause they're— they— These are also
kind of from the jungle. I think they're just
multiple DJUNGELSKOGs. But that's— I was
thinking of that guy. Dude, you nailed it. You nailed it.
You nailed it, Ben. 100% vindicated.
I knew what DJUNGELSKOG was. What's the news, boys? Finland is undefended. Oh boy.
Wow. This has been
a tough day for you. That's a rough day, boys. It's been a really rough day. I've had a lot of fun. If it makes
you feel any better, you can keep the DJUNGELSKOG. That's actually not true. We have Amy—
We got it for Amy. Good luck.
Good luck. Bye. Bye. Oh, DJUNGELSKOG.
What have they gotten into now? Those poor boys. (grumbles profusely) Hey, at least they can come
to Finland now and fail this. Who knows? I had it locked in, Sam. Yeah.
I cracked under the pressure. It's tough. It's just like golf. Golf is hard.
Golf is hard because it's— it requires such calmness. I'mma be mad at
myself all night now 'cause it's the end of
the game day, right? It's... What time is it?
Pretty much, yeah. How long do we have?
We have five minutes. Well, we need to
We need to clean this up. clean this up a little bit. I guess let's walk
towards the station. Yeah. Between us, I'm taking quite a bit
of the blame for this. We are not as good
at challenges as they are. Certainly not
based on the statistics. Right? Tomorrow, we speedrun. Tomorrow we let them chase us. We let them come here and
spend a huge amount of time trying to build Angry Birds
and do it. We let them spend a huge
amount of time on everything, and we run. I think it's the only
logical thing to do at this point. It's the only thing we can do.
We have a lot of flight budget. We have two days left. Maybe we can just outrun them. Okay, so we've got
a few extra minutes left in the day. We're just gonna go
back to the station and end our day there. So we can get up bright and early
and go back to Copenhagen. Big day. Big day. We pulled it back.
We pulled it back. I think if we can pull
Denmark out, then they are in big, big,
big, big trouble. I couldn't agree more. Anyway, we've got
15 seconds, so... Alright, well
we're at the junction of Fredriksgatan and, uh,
Södra Jarnvägsgatan. Vuhh, close enough. We are outside
whatever that place is that says Art and Ham. So I guess first thing
in the morning, we head to the airport. First thing in the morning,
we head to the airport, Sam, and we run. Okay, well...
Well... End of the day. It's 5:30 pm, and this guy
needs to go to bed. Yeah, he has gotten
a li'l cranky. Alright, we will see you
tomorrow morning, 7:30 am at this exact location. And then we're gonna
do a perfect job and win the game, I think. I think
That's my plan. that's a very good plan. It's my plan.
And I think we should do it. Okay, we'll see you
tomorrow morning. Good night.
(both smooching) Alright, 6:30.
See you tomorrow. Good night. ♪ Good morning,
good morning ♪ ♪ It's 7:30 am,
good morning ♪ We're at ""Svåger-top"". It's a brisk morning
here in Sweden. It's cold and...
It is cold. I fear there's a possibility that we will end up
somewhere even colder today. Very possible. But for now, we are
going to Copenhagen to attempt the Denmark steal, and then we will figure out where to next. Let's go to Copenhagen. Welcome to day five.
Good morning! We're so back.
It's still dark out, Tom. (cackles) This is a long night.
Yeah. Well, let's walk to the station.
Yes. 'Cause I think the first move is inevitably gonna be
a train to the airport. Yeah, we did look
at ferries, but... the flights have been
way cheaper than expected. So we still have
flight budget left. It's faster. It gets us
to more connections. We're going by plane.
Yeah. We think we're getting
to the point in the game where there is diminishing value
of locking countries. Diminishing.
Not zero, but diminishing. Increasing value of just
simply claiming countries. Yeah, and on
the flight yesterday I managed to identify
a three-jump sequence that would get us
three countries claimed today, which at this point in the game
is almost impossible. The catch is... that we can't book the next flight
until we land... and the connections are tight. The state of the game now,
Tom, is basically that... Ben and Adam are
24 hours behind us. They're starting from Malmö. We started from Malmö.
Yeah. They'll start heading
towards Copenhagen a little bit earlier than we did,
but not by that much. And they will pull
the challenge immediately and find they cannot even
start it until 10 am. Well, yeah.
Unless they find a LEGO store. (laughs) Unless they find
a LEGO store. Yeah, okay. 'Cause if they
were paying attention to the tracker closely, they probably would've
figured out that... We went to the airport
and there wasn't LEGO there. And they do have the advantage
of knowing that we failed. So that does give 'em
an advantage, and just, they know that they need to be more methodical
and come up with... you know, that it is
highly failable. How did...
""Y-Yungel-skorp"" sleep? What's his name? Oh, not well. He kept waking me up. But he's, you know,
he's very young, so he can't get through it. He can't sleep
through the night yet. Whoof! I am a little worried about
this Denmark challenge 'cause it took them a long time
and then they failed. Yeah. It's not a good sign. No. A little scary. And I will say
it is still the case that we have not, no one... has succeeded at a challenge
another team failed. It's true. Because seemingly
they didn't even try this Sweden one. No, they didn't
even attempt it. I still believe
our instructions were as good as
they could possibly be on that set, Sam. I struggle to see
how we could have sped that up by 25%.
Right, yeah. What would've done it was—-
would've been a different LEGO set. Yeah.
So, they'll do that, and then their best
flight to Helsinki is the same one that we took.
Same one that we took. Which means they will come here
and they'll try and do Angry Birds. You know, one interesting thing that I saw, Tom?
What's that? So starting around
like 1 pm today... Uh-huh? It starts snowing
pretty strong here. Okay.
And I don't know— I mean, obviously
it snows a lot here. I'm sure the airport can
handle a lot of snow, but... Maybe, I mean,
it continues into tomorrow. Maybe they face some difficulties. I've been trapped
in Oslo Airport before. Uh-huh.
Because of snow. Look, even the best airports,
they just get backed up with de-icing and runway clearing
and stuff like that. I think our biggest
advantage today, Tom, is that if they are just replicating our day yesterday...
Yeah. We know they're
going to move slow. And we know the challenges
are gonna be difficult. Yeah, and... if the— if we move fast,
while they're moving slow... that could...
That's the plan. start to gain us an advantage.
That is the plan. Alright.
So, Sam... Let's get to the airport.
Let's move fast. I mean, let's—
We're not in a rush. The flight's at 11.
So we've actually got loads of time. But you know, metaphorically,
let's move fast. Now we gotta transfer
on the train to Copenhagen. Seemingly, 'train'... in Swedish is 'tåg', which sort of makes... our game tag into
a really fun pun here. Copenhagen. (yawns) Everybody....
wants to go to Copenhagen. We've done it. We've boarded
the train to Copenhagen. Just barely. Good news, it's
only a 30 minute train. Airport, six minutes,
platform two. Did you book the flight yet?
No, we can do it on the train. We were kinda busy yesterday. Yeah, well, we also didn't know
we necessarily wanted it yet. That's true. Still dark. (laughs) Starting to get—
Sorry, Finland. We've not really shown you
in the best light here, have we? Is that a pun? ...Yes, I absolutely
intended that. Okay.
Yeah, 100%. Alright, Tom, the... The 11:15 to Vilnius:
still available. Yep. It'll be a total of 308 euros
for the two of us. For the two of us?
Yeah. We've been really lucky
with flight prices, Sam. Mhm. And the potential
connections onward looking good? Looks on time.
I can double check the price. Here we go. We identified there's a... three-flight route. We can go to Lithuania... then Poland... then maybe... Croatia. I'm not convinced by Croatia. I'm not convinced
by Croatia either. But the timing is perfect.
It gets in at 5:20. Even if we don't make
the third country... we have a chance to
lock a massive country in case it goes to a tiebreaker.
We need the area bonus. I think you said yesterday that even though
we don't have the luck, we have to play risky here
to try and stay ahead. Yeah. Adam and Ben have a
less risky path of victory than us. Yeah. Alright. Book it.
We're going to Vilnius. Let's do it. It's gonna be
really embarrassing if it turns out to be
pronounced 'vil-nis' or something like that. Jet Lag staple.
Mispronouncing places. We are booked. Next stop, Lithuania. The lads are moving
at speed through Denmark. They are nearly back
at Copenhagen. Back... in Copenhagen. Are you ready to
simply lock in, Benjamin? Ohh, I have never been
more ready to lock in in my life. Denmark, have no fear. Ben and Adam have arrived
to rescue you from Tom and Sam. Adam, are you ready to see
what the Denmark challenge is? I'm ready, Benjamin.
Okay. Attempting to steal
with this challenge. Build a LEGO set blind.
Oh dear. Build a LEGO set blind. Denmark: the birthplace of LEGOs. Build a LEGO set with
at least 200 pieces in under 45 minutes,
and for some good fun, do it blindfolded. Only one team member
must be blindfolded. This team member must
do all the assembly. The other team member
may use the instructions to guide the blindfolded builder, but is not allowed to
assemble the LEGOs himself. He may hold and move
exactly one piece at a time, as long as he doesn't
put pieces together or take them apart. Well, step one is going to be
acquiring a LEGO set. It's 8 am and I don't know that you can buy LEGOs
at 8 am. May be tough. Here's something that I know. We both love LEGOs. We do. We are intimately
acquainted with LEGOs. Back at the airport.
Tom, Tom. Yeah?
Give us tunnel facts. This is the northernmost underground railway
station in the world. Yay. I looked that up yesterday after you said give us
some tunnel facts, and I didn't have any. The lads have made it to Copenhagen Central Station. Okay, so probably about now
they're realizing that... (chuckles)
hopefully... They cannot do a challenge
for another 40 minutes. That's actually not as bad as—
No, time zones, Tom. One hour and 40 minutes. Mm. If they've just pulled
the challenge... then they're desperately
looking around for anywhere that might sell LEGO
that is not the LEGO Store. There's a LEGO Store...
Oh, in the airport. In the airport?
Well, this is what I was gonna say. I figure that the only place
you can buy LEGOs at 8 am is the airport. So we're gonna have to...
(imitates swishing) Maybe.
Unless it would be faster to wait for
another place to open. Let me see. No, no. I think we need to start
heading to the airport, frankly. Well, my— Is the
LEGO Store before security? I don't know
the answer to that. Worst case scenario,
we could get our next ticket. Yeah.
And just go in, and then leave. My opinion is we should just
head to the airport right now 'cause that's where
the LEGOs are and we should go from there.
Okay. 'Cause there's a train
in two minutes. CPH Lufthavn.
Yeah. It's track two.
Okay, great. So what we need to
figure out is, one, how can we get these LEGOs
as quickly as possible? And then two, how can we... then get as quickly as possible,
three miles away from the airport to do the LEGOs and then
go back to the airport? Kind of an album cover. Thank you, Tom. So Tom, you remember
how I was telling you that it gets snowy this afternoon?
Yeah. It's not that many yet.
Not yet. But look, there's
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 cancellations already this afternoon.
Now, two of those names – Oulu, Rovaniemi –
they're far north. They're far north.
So the snow's moving in there. But not Geneva and Tallinn. Yeah.
And not New York. And it's not like
they're just delayed. They just flat out cancelled 'em.
So maybe shortage of aircraft? Hopefully these are omens
for difficulty for Ben and Adam. Hopefully if they're
trying to fly here. 'Cause I bet they won't
look up the weather. They don't— They don't—
No. They always assume
the best case scenario. (laughs)
I mean, so far that's worked out
pretty well for them. Okay. We've arrived at the airport.
Not for a flight, but for LEGOs. Sure hope that... LEGOs are pre-security. I'm just getting grumpy
anytime I see LEGO now. There's a toy shop just there. I can only assume that Ben and Adam are in a
similar position right now. Yeah, should we
check their location? Yeah, let's see
what they're up to. Oh, they've done
the same move as us. They've gone to the airport?
They've gone to the airport. Oh! There's also the possibility
they do what we didn't. They book their next flight,
go through security, get a LEGO, leave, and then come back.
(chuckles) 'Cause we know that you can
get LEGOs post-security. Yeah, but you
don't save much time. You know, by the time
they get back to Central, yeah, it'd be almost 10, and they might not
get the best LEGO. And there's a better
selection at the LEGO shop. Well actually we
did see a better LEGO post-security yesterday.
Yes we did, didn't we? At Copenhagen Airport.
Oh, we did. We found the LEGO shop.
Tom, look at this one. This one would've been doable. And that one
would've been doable. Oh no. Yeah. Alright. Yeah, so far,
their tracker is pre-security. I wonder if they went through
the same logical jumps we did. We could, if they
were post-security, buy a ticket on the flight
that we think we want to take. And then go in. It'll take a little while,
but we might have to. Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that that is post-security. Almost certainly. Yeah, I think we might
have to buy a ticket and go into the airport
to buy these LEGOs. So now, the question is where do we think
we might want to go next? So just looking at the map,
looking at what's remaining... are there decent flights
to anywhere in Poland? No. Definitely not. Yeah, I mean,
Oslo's just right up there. Right, because it's
not a huge airport. (gasps) We can fly into... What time? It doesn't give us
a ton of time to do this— Well, it gives us basically
no time to do this. Yeah, but we have
to get in past security, get the thing, go three miles,
do the whole challenge, get back to the airport. We have an hour
and a half to do this. That means we have 45 minutes to go, boom, out, attempt, back here, go. I think this is our best flight.
Okay. So we think we have
a route that looks good. We can fly to a kind of
weird airport in Norway and then have time to
make a connection down and end the day
in Warsaw, Poland, which we feel like is a really... solid way to pick up
two countries today. It doesn't give us the most time to get the LEGOs and
do this challenge, but I think that this...
I think this is a good flight. Okay, get those tickets. How much time are
we gonna have here? So I think we want— So we realistically don't have a lot of prep time. But that's okay. Let's assume that we got
to the shop in the airport. This is what we'd have found,
and that's probably— The Minecraft stuff
would be pretty easy, I think. Oh, that's...
That's blocky. 238 pieces maybe. But there's a lot of
tiny little things that have to be put together
precisely there as well. But I think
fewer than with ours. 'Cause ours was
That's true. one of these or something.
Yeah. Egh. Okay, the DJUNGELSKOG
got flagged in security, so Adam is dealing with that. I'm running to just see
if I can find a LEGO set. Okay, there are LEGO sets here. We need something
that's 200 pieces. Closest to 200 pieces. 82, 204? It's pretty good. But I feel like we
want something that is as repetitive as possible. One of these, 325. 278, no. Mini orchid, 274, no. How many pieces is this? This doesn't even say. Okay, so... not all these sets
have piece numbers. But I looked this one up.
It has 220. Which is slightly more
than that Harry Potter one, but it's very repetitive,
which I think will be useful. Okay, I found the perfect LEGO set,
but I don't know where Adam is. (no speech) We really, really can't
afford this, okay. This.
Perfect. 220 pieces.
It's all repetitive. Let's go. How's their tracker looking? Alright, let's see
how they're doing. It looks like they were airside and now they're not? So did they do
the thing we didn't? They went airside to buy and then they're going
back into the city? Because they know
where they're going. They might have been
able to find the LEGO set that we found at the airport. Yeah.
That we thought would be good. If they found
that pride LEGO set... that's gonna be easy.
Oh yeah, they are... They are outside.
They are definitely landside now. Okay, yeah, this is not good. If we want any chance,
any chance of making that flight, we need to take the 10:15
from this station, back here. So we're gonna get in, 9:45. We gotta just start immediately. We'll have
half an hour to try it. Well, and you got stuck for... Something. I still think we can
maybe pull it off. Where are they?
What are they doing? Alright.
Gate 11. Let's get outta here
before Helsinki freezes over. No more cancellations yet. That was a pun. That was just completely wasted.
Completely wasted. Okay. As soon as we get
three miles from the airport... we can start.
You got a blindfold? Great. As soon as we get three miles. Okay. There's our plane, Tom.
I think this is gonna be... Ah.
propeller plane... Good little plane.
debut on Jet Lag: The Game. I like this. Is it bad that just
for 5 or 10 seconds, I couldn't actually remember
where we were going? It's all a blur. (laughs) I think it's Latvia. It's not. It's Lithuania. It's one of those two.
(continues laughing) Okay, we're gonna just build
on top of this box. Okay. Gimme a second. Okay. There's three? There's three flowers.
Okay. Okay, take this.
Okay. Now, okay, we're gonna...
put that down actually, sorry. We're gonna build
six of these, okay? Okay.
So, here's this. Okay.
This flat, okay? Okay. So you're gonna put
the— this on there. It's— There's only
one way it can go. Super easy, yep. And then you're gonna
put this on the other side. Oh. Where'd it go?
Where'd it go? It's right there.
It's right there. Hold it— Hand it to me. Okay. Okay, and we're just
doing that six times. Got it, love it. I'm ready. Doing good. Doing great. One more. I thought there was six.
Was this six? This is six.
Okay. Okay, so now... take this wheel and we're gonna clip
those equidistant around. Yep, just like that, perfect. Okay, put that down. Okay.
Yep, put that down. Okay, so we're gonna
make six of these. I love when we have to
make six of something. There's no way
that plane has Wi-Fi. We are not gonna know
the results until we land. If we find out the result of this
while we're still here... we've been delayed. Unless they nail it
in 15 minutes. Oh, okay, yes. If they call us immediately,
then we're in trouble. Yeah. Here's another one. Here, here, here. This guy, this guy, this guy. Now you're gonna put that guy
on top of that guy, okay? The one that you just built. Yep, j— no, flip... Yeah, yeah, yeah, perfect.
Okay, put that down. Now we're just doing
stick time. Love it. There you go.
We're moving quick. We got plenty of time. I'm gonna hand you this.
You're gonna put it in the top. And then your flower
is gonna go right on top of that. Okay?
This way? Yep.
Good? Yep, yep.
You got the first flower. What I hope is happening,
I hope that right now, one of them is just
very, very frustrated. I don't really mind which one. I just want one of them
to be really annoyed. Yeah. They're gonna be really
peaceful and calm aren't they? Stick. Gidgy. Stick. Gidgy. Stick. Gidgy. Stick. Gidgy. What is the second word
you're saying? Gidgy.
Gidgy? It's like a little gidgy. Imagine you're actually
on Ben and Adam's side. I know we're not. Imagine it. What advice
would you give them? For doing the challenge?
Yeah. It would've been useful
if we had ahead of time agreed on terminology.
That's true. Because up meant up... Well...
Yeah. It was like out, in,
left, right, up, down. Except sometimes it was
up-down or front-back. You'd say rotate 90 degrees. There are three possible axes
and sometimes it's obvious if it's a long, flat piece.
Right. But if it's
just vaguely cubic... Yeah. If we had taken just five minutes
to standardize terminology, we could have saved
a little bit of time. Yeah. Okay, so rotate it
so that the pointiest part of the petal...
Yeah. So you're holding a petal.
Pointy like that? This way? This orientation? So make sure the pointy part
is facing the sky. Yeah.
Yes, facing the sky. No, no, no.
It's not facing the sky. How is it not facing the sky?
Rotate it, rotate it. No, rotate it the other way.
This? No, no.
No? Rotate it.
Like this? Nope. Okay, what the (bleep)? This? That— You're
touching the pointy part. This?
Yeah. Okay, now just flip it
180 degrees. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
Now stick that on there. It needs to go up.
Like that? Yeah, that's perfect. Okay.
Okay. And we are just
gonna need to do that on each side. Zero Celsius, Sam. Balmy. (laughs) Okay, third flower. So I believe that this is
actually the exact same flower. But in a different color.
I guess that doesn't matter to you. So you know this well.
Here's your wheel. You're gonna put the wheel down. Now we're making
six little petals. Okay.
We know how to do that, okay? Boom. Here's this, this, and this. This, this, and this. And this. Isn't LEGOs so fun? Yep, yep, yep, yep. We love Denmark. Yep, yep, yep. Okay, got it. Okay, so now we're building
the core thing again, okay? Yep.
Perfect. And you're gonna go ahead
and put that right on the middle of your flower. And Adam, I have
good news for you. It's time to
build the long stick? It's time to
build the long stick. Let's do it.
There you go. And we're just gonna
go one at a time. Folks... The botanical set is the
real key to this challenge. Can you imagine if we had
a regular LEGO set? Yeah, well, I almost bought
a Harry Potter one. Jesus. And then I was like,
no, it's just gonna be, I was like... I gotta find one that is... easier to repeat, okay. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. God, this rules.
Yep. And yep. Boom, boom, boom. Finally this. And you're gonna go ahead
and pick up your flower and you're gonna pop
that right on there. Is that it?
And Adam... that is it, in 24 minutes. Ohhh! (bleep) yeah! Let's go! Here's our lovely bouquet. Okay, what's the next train
back to the airport? Let's (bleep)-ing go! (coughs profusely) Let's go. That was incredible. We still might
miss this flight. So we gotta... (cracks up) We gotta go. We gotta go. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no. They're calling early.
They're calling early. It's concerning. This is bad.
This is bad. This is bad. They're gonna show us a... fully completed LEGO set. We have some flowers for you! We built some
incredible LEGO flowers. Do you wanna know
how long it took us? 27 minutes. I'm gonna hang up on them. Yeah. (blurts laugh) That's tough for them.
They did not have much to say. What's really annoying... is that that's one of
the sets we rejected. Actually... These are... These are kids' ones?
These are kids' ones? It's not great, Tom.
It's not great. It's not great. What does that make it? Pretty hard to beat
is what it makes the score. Whew. Okay, back to the airport. Nope. I think you're allowed to leave
the airport and come back. Yeah. Yeah. Look. It's gonna be tight. We're not out of the woods yet. Alright buddy. Let's do it. Okay. Okay, the flight boards
in what, 15 minutes? Boarding starts
in 15 minutes, yeah. Okay. Then let's boogie. Okay. Let's hope that it lets us
back in the airport. Yeah. I thought this might happen. It's not letting us back in
'cause I think we left the airport, so we have to talk to a person. Hi, it said to see agent. We checked in, but then we left
the airport. So now we're back. We need to go down to SAS? Okay, our flight
leaves in 45 minutes. Thank you. Okay. Oh shoot. Not a chance.
Look at those lines. Talk to SAS. Is there any way
to get to a person that's not through
one of these crazy lines? Service point?
SAS service point? Hi, we checked in and
went through security, but we are here. Yes.
Yeah. Our flight leaves— Okay.
Thank you. Thank you. Oh, shoot. Hello. It's digital. Uh-huh. The flight leaves in 43 minutes. Okay, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. That was faster than
I thought it would be. That was pretty good. Okay, up, up, up.
Yep. Okay, camera has to go off
while we go through security. Wish us luck. Okay, I made it through this time. Ben's bag got pulled. What news, Sam? It doesn't have it. What? It doesn't show up. The connection to Warsaw? It's not bookable. Sam... I... If we don't make that... and they take Finland... ...we're done. Yeah. Can we at least get to Estonia to stop them taking
the ferry south tomorrow? Even if they're snowed in? There's a Riga
and Tallinn flight. There's a Riga flight. I can check that. Let's check that. Are we? Are we still? Are we still— Okay. Oh. Welcome to Lithuania, Tom. Oh, yeah. I wish we had better news here
other than just another bus. Yeah, a lot of bus gates. Okay. Flight has been
delayed 20 minutes. I think we're gonna make it.
We're gonna be just fine. We would like to
give a huge shoutout to Diego at the
Copenhagen Airport who put us in fast track security. Yeah, on the
condition that we... We shout him out. shout out Diego at
the Copenhagen Airport. That to me is a very good deal. Okay. I think we are
going to make it to this place near Oslo.
Yep. Look Ben, we recognize this. Off to Sandefjord. Sandefjord. I've always wanted
to go to Sandefjord. Me too. Since two and a half hours ago, I've always wanted
to go to Sandefjord. I was really... excited to go to Sandefjord
when I learned that it was a place. You know you're going
somewhere weird when you do this to
get on the plane. There are not a lot of people
on this plane to Sandefjord, Norway. But... But we are certainly on it. But we are certainly on it
and we are happy to be on it. We are learning a lot
of words for 'arrivals', Sam. This is a very
different vibe of airport than the other ones we've been in.
Yeah. Yeah, because that appears
to be just a town over there. Yeah. That's just
the end of a street. I imagine this is just
Vilnius's original airport. I guess. Or at least a rather old one. Because they haven't built
airports like this in a while. I mean, I wish we were
seeing more of Lithuania. Well, I don't, I wish we were on a flight to Poland
very shortly, but... Yeah. Okay, should we head inside
Let's head in. And make our plan? We need to figure out
which flight we are taking. How many airports
have you seen that look like this, Tom? It's really nice. It's very train station esque. Right? Geez, this is... Okay!
This is unique. Well, here's a good
planning spot, Tom. Okay, so the first thing is
we are not taking the flight that is honestly
the reason we came here. Yeah. It's sold out. To Warsaw.
Because it's sold out. And not only is it sold out, but...
It's a thousand. The price went up to... 1,100 euros for the two of us. Great, yeah. So I mean, our next best option
seems to be... It's either
the 15:15 to Tallinn or the 15:20 to Riga, and we really need to call that
in the next few minutes so we don't get locked out.
Yes. So I've just checked
both Tallinn and Riga. There are no onward
connections we can make today. Okay.
So... That's really bad news.
So... it seems like... between Riga and Tallinn... only Riga has a flight that
gets us anywhere useful at a decent time
tomorrow morning. Yes. We could in theory
steal Liechtenstein. Yeah. Maybe we could
steal Liechtenstein and get to Luxembourg. Yeah, or somewhere else, yeah. Or somewhere, anywhere. Book. Book, book, book, book.
Get us to Riga, Sam. Get us to Riga.
It is the only option we have left. I just noticed, I mean, I think this will make
our decision earlier, but flights are
diverting from Tallinn. What? It must be getting
the same snow. That snowstorm's arrived. Yeah, but just from Tallinn— The Warsaw to Tallinn flight!
We were thinking of getting that! Yeah. Yeah, I mean, hopefully
the weather's better in Riga. Riga looks alright.
Cloudy conditions. Yeah, Riga's good. Riga's good. Okay. Oh, let's hope for terrible,
terrible weather in Helsinki. At least we didn't go
to Tallinn! Let me book to Riga. The— It said, unfortunately,
we are unable to confirm this flight fare that we offered you
because of technical issues. Oh no.
And it's actually 830 euros. Oh my god! (laughs hysterically) (sighs) Because if we take that flight,
we then can't take any more. The budget's gone. Pretty much. And we can't go to Tallinn because of the weather that
we were complaining about. We can try.
We can try. Let me see what happens
if we try to book to Tallinn. Lemme see what
flight they're on. Sam, I'm... We've been certain they've
been going to Helsinki, right? Yeah? I can't find either of them
on the tracker. And Adam was last seen
in the airport an hour ago?
Yeah? But that's— So they didn't take the flight
that we took then. No. Where might they have gone? There's a flight to Nice. That makes a little bit of sense,
but not a ton. No, no, 'cause that'd
just give them Monaco, right? Unless they just wanna
go somewhere warm. We're here in Norway. Welcome to Norway. What's this place called again?
Where are we? Sp— Spa— Svag— I don't know. They've landed.
They're in Norway. In Oslo?
In— In— Well, it says ""Skaggrak"". Skagerrak, Skagerrak?
It's the secondary... They must have been on
that flight that I thought, so... Yeah. If they're gonna
the secondary airport, that probably means
they're gonna try to lock. We should go to Tallinn. Oh, although...
What? There is a Warsaw
that they could make... Oh no! That gets in early enough
from that airport. Oh no. Okay, there's a bus
in three minutes that we really want to
make, buddy. I don't think
this airport is that big. Let's explain to the poor audience
what we're doing because they're probably
very confused. Okay. It's not that confusing. We just have to get
three miles from the airport. And so we're taking
a bus to the train station and we'll take a train until
we're three miles away. It's not so bad. That's exactly
what we're doing. And then we're gonna go ahead
and open the Norway challenge. But we wanna kinda do it quickly because there's a flight
outta here to Warsaw, Poland, which is kind of our
whole reason for coming here, was that it was
such a good connection, so... Yeah.
Priority número uno is... Make that flight.
Make that flight. Gotta make that flight. The sun is already going down.
What time is it? It's almost one. Oh, well,
that's basically nighttime. Okay, so... Hello. We're on the train. We're gonna get off in Tønsberg. Yes, that's what
we're going to do. How do you pronounce
that O with the— that guy? No one knows. There's no one in the world
who knows how to pronounce it. Too bad. We're getting off in Tønsberg and then we're gonna
go ahead and open this guy and see if we can go ahead
and lock up Norway. If we go to Riga, we haven't got enough
flight budget left to get to places we'd need. Yeah. The only other flight we have out of here is Tallinn.
Oh. There's no— There's
literally no other choice, Sam. Book Tallinn. I mean, okay.
Let's check for the 20th time. Yeah. Warsaw, we can't take. No.
Sold out. Our only option now, Sam... Now the Warsaw flight
is unavailable, the only option is Tallinn. Okay. No? I don't know what
to tell you, buddy. It's just not showing up. What, it's sold out? It must be. It's not showing up anymore.
Okay. Okay, hello, camera.
Hello, camera. So the flight that we wanted
to connect to out of here... That flight is—
does not exist anymore. And now we are in... the middle of absolute nowhere
in Norway. I just don't...
So that's kind of fun. So that's kind of fun. Alright, so we have a little— We have an hour and
40 minutes 'til our flight. Okay. I'm gonna force you
to go outside, Tom. (laughs) We're in Lithuania.
That's fair. We need to look at Lithuania.
That's fair. The Lithuanians
are gonna be mad if we don't look at Lithuania. Clever.
It's really cold outside. So make sure to set
the automatic doors so you have to get close to 'em. There is an airport train station.
It's not much, but there is one. Also...
It's single track. Yeah, and I do like just the catenary there.
It looks really nice. That's not a design
I've seen before. See, Lithuania has
electrified railways. You know where it doesn't? Most of the United States? Yep.
Yeah. Alright.
Alright. We have come to
this street corner to appreciate Lithuania. We appreciate Lithuania and the point it has given us. Okay, it is kind of cold. Back to the airport. Do you wanna go get
through security? They appear to
have left the airport. Okay. So I guess
they're trying to claim? They're either trying to claim or get to the other
Oslo airport, but... it looks like that's
all their points for the day. It'd be pretty funny if they
went to the wrong airport again. We need to see how early we can get out of Sandefjord
tomorrow morning. Because... we gotta get back in the game. There's nothing if we go
all the way to Oslo. We couldn't get to Oslo
fast enough, I don't think. Should we go to Oslo...
For the morning? Yeah, probably.
For the morning. We should probably ride
all the way up to Oslo now. 'Tis a nice little airport. I'm a fan. We could get— We could be stuck here
for a little while, Tom, I'm gonna be honest.
Why? Because the inbound
flights to Tallinn don't look great. We thank you for airBaltic
and wish you a pleasant flight. Sam, our incoming flight
is from Tallinn to Vilnius. Uh-huh? It has not yet left Tallinn. Yeech. That's not good. That board up there that said it's only
five minutes late? It's a lie. It's a complete lie. Yeech. If that flight's
delayed any more... Actually I think we... And we just got delayed
to 16:00. Norway has the nicest drunks. This guy came up to us,
and he was like, ""My bag is full of drugs. Do you
guys wanna come to a museum?"" Yeah.
And we were like, no. Well, actually Adam was like, no.
And I was like, maybe. But then Adam was like, no. Alright, Adam. Benjamin... It's time to lock Norway. Oof, in Oslo. A place that we did not think
we would be coming today. Yeah.
They are still in Vilnius. Which does not seem... right 'cause they've— they're
still at the airport. They didn't attempt a challenge. So I don't know why
they would've been at the airport for this long. No, I mean, maybe
their options were just really bad. It makes me wonder if
something has gone wrong. Because transparently,
I'm trying to do the math here. And we're up 10–7. Oh, the math is looking
a-good. It's very good. I mean, if they don't
make it out tonight, which they would
need to leave soon... Yeah. I think that would be that. Alright, we have been
doing... math. Yeah. I have looked at a lot
of flight schedules. We believe that if they lock Norway... ...that might be game over. Yeah, because we
can't steal Liechtenstein. We can't get there.
We can't get there. There might be a way
for us to claim three. I don't know.
We think. Steal Oslo...
and get somewhere else. I'm not sure where
that somewhere else would be right now, but... If they, if they win
the Norway challenge right now... I think that might be it, Tom.
I think that might be it. Just for extra clarity,
here's the basic math. The score right now is 10–7 and the game automatically
ends at 5:30 tomorrow. In order to tie, we need to – by 5:30 tomorrow –
net three countries. The trouble is,
in the case of a tie, the team who has claimed
the greatest area wins and Ben and Adam have
locked enough big countries to guarantee that they'll
have the greatest area, which means that actually
we need to net four countries. With existing flight schedules, there is only one
theoretical way to do this. First of all, we need Ben and Adam
to get snowed in or something and not claim anything else
for the rest of the game. Assuming that happens,
if our flight does leave tonight, we would get to Tallinn,
claiming Estonia. Then tomorrow we could fly to Norway
and steal it, netting two more. Then if we were fast enough,
we could maybe get a flight to one more unclaimed country. We don't know for certain
if this is even possible, but here's one thing
we do know for certain: If they lock Norway, there is no possible
path to victory for us. Ugh. Hopefully it's
something weird with... (chuckles grimly) Maybe it's eating
some of their weird fish stuff or something, you know? You ready? I'm ready. Let's go down there where there's— Let's go, there's like a thing.
It's like a whole thing. Oh. You wanna go there? Benjamin... You ready? I feel that if we lock this, I am gonna sort of
stop being worried. I think that this could
very potentially seal their fate. Are you ready?
Let's take a look. Here is the Norway challenge. Appreciate your surroundings. Appreciate your surroundings. The Norwegian idea of ""kos"" means:
""embracing peace and happiness, ""being in the moment,
and fully appreciating the surroundings
you find yourself in."" For this challenge, spend ten minutes silently
admiring your surroundings. One of you will write a list of ten things
in your surroundings, while the other draws
your surroundings. All ten of the things
on teammate one's list must be undeniably visible
in teammate two's drawings. You may attempt this three times,
but must go to new surroundings (ie. at least half a mile
away from prior attempts). That's nice.
That is nice. Okay, well... We should try and do this
before the sun sets. Yeah, yeah.
Well, we have an hour. Sam, our flight status
has changed. Not on the boards,
not with any announcements. But instead of 'status: delayed', it now says 'status: unknown'. Mm, interesting. Actually, I don't see any flight
that has left Tallinn anytime recently.
It's only inbound flights. So maybe... (laughs) I don't think
we're going to Tallinn. Maybe our flight's
gonna get canceled? That would be bad
for our chances, Tom. (cackles profusely) A lot of things are bad for
our chances at this point. That would be
devastating to our chances. Yeah. Well... Our chances, Sam, were
pretty much already devastated. Hello camera.
Hello. We found something
beautiful to admire. So Adam is gonna draw this and I am going to name
ten things that I can see. All ten things that I list have to be in
Adam's... illustration. Yep.
I think we can do that. Alright buddy,
we got ten minutes. Ready to start admiring?
Yep. Okay. Alright, I'm gonna
start the timer. They've been
on the harbourfront next to the opera house
for a little while now. Yep. That's very open
and very cold. I wonder what they're up to. It's a nice area.
It's lovely. I've been there before.
Yeah. Oh, that's nice.
They'll have a great camera shot. Great view of... Polar plunge maybe? (chortles) (phone timer ping) That's time, Ben. Okay, no more admiring. Your admiring is finished. Alright, Ben,
what did you write down? So my first thing is the hills across the water. Yes, those are the hills. The trees on those hills. Yes, these are
the trees on the hills. The water itself.
Yes. The water fowl. Yes, the little birds
in the water. The little— yes. The sky. Yes, I even wrote
the word 'sky' 'cause I was worried that people would think
I didn't mean to draw the sky. I did a little bit of shading.
Hell yeah. The pillars in the water. Yes, the pillars are here. The cruise ship. Obviously, yes.
It's a big one. I actually literally didn't even
notice it for a little while 'cause the sun was blocking it. The buildings to the right
of the cruise ship. Yes, the buildings,
right there. The floating platform,
just to the right over there. Yes, that is right there. And my very last thing, Adam, is the beautiful sunset. And of course there's the wonderful sun setting. Ben... In that case,
that means that we have locked the great country of Norway. And with it, if they
have not yet left Vilnius... I think they might be... I think things might be...
donezo. very, very bad for them. And there they are. And they're still
there at the airport. Maybe they have a flight out. Let's call them.
I don't think so. Gentlemen.
Hello, Sam and Tom. Hello.
Hello. We have spent... Oh, can I just say incredible composition
of the shot there. Oh, thank you.
Pretty looking. Thank you, well... Way better weather
there than here. Yeah. And you know, the reason that the shot
is composed so beautifully is that we've just spent
the last ten minutes admiring our scenery. Yes. And I drew...
Adequately. a beautiful picture of it. And Ben wrote down
ten things that he saw. And wouldn't you believe it? All ten things
that Ben wrote down were visible in my picture. We have some other
news for you as well. Yeah, what's going on?
Which is that... Why are you still in Vilnius? The flight that was meant to
take us to Tallinn from here... has just been announced
that it is so far delayed that we can no longer take it. It goes too far into
the rest period. Ooh. Yeah, there's supposed to be
almost a foot of snow in Tallinn today.
Yeah. We are stuck here.
(giggles) There is no path forward.
You have locked Oslo. We cannot get anywhere
until tomorrow morning. We need four points because
the tie's broken by area, and you've got that as well. There is no path for four points
and zero for you tomorrow. That is the game. Well, if y'all want
to maybe head to London, I think we have
something to give you. Yeah.
Okay. Alright, gentlemen,
we will see you in London. Maybe we should all
take the teleporter. Teleporter. Teleporter. Okay, fine, Tom. Teleporter.
Well played. Stand up.
Well played, yes. Do you know how to do this? Teleporter.
Well, it depends. Are we doing Star Trek
or are we doing my kids shows
from when I was a chi— from when I was like... Whichever is the one
where you just jump and then you end up there.
We're gonna jump. Kids show teleporter.
Got it. Okay, you ready?
Ready? Yeah. Alright. Three, two, one. Hey!
Oh, hey guys. We're here.
Welcome back. Good to see ya.
We got our DJUNGELSKOG. Eyyy! He made it too, he made it
through the wormhole. Okay, it was a monkey.
It wasn't the bear. It's both.
It was. It's both. Okay. It's a monkey or a bear.
And it's also— Or a panda. Right.
A panda counts as well. Well...
That's the game. Unfortunately...
You took that. (laughs) There was nothing
we could have done there. Yeah. There were several things
we could have done earlier, but there was nothing
we could have done there. And we learned
in the wormhole our flight was actually
canceled, so... Yes.
Okay, well... that is tough. It is— It's our job to
give you a thing I believe. I believe...
Do you have them? I do. Well,
I'm actually just gonna— It's gonna kinda
float magically in now. Okay. Oh, there it is. Oh my god.
Woah! I didn't know
you could float things through the air, Tom.
Yep. There we go. We have 33 individual
small trophies, one for each country
of Schengen. And if you assemble them
like a LEGO set... Wait, wait, let me... Yep.
Oh yeah. Ben... Now all you need to do is just
move your hands really fast. Just move 'em. (imitates whooshes) And like cartoon animals fighting, we have one massive trophy
for season 13. Whoa!
Whoa!
They assembled that really fast. It was really good. Explains how they got
the LEGO challenge. Absolutely. Congratulations!
Congratulations! Thank you.
Thank you. It's been an absolute honour
to be part of this. It was so much fun.
Thank you so, so much. Thank you for coming
on our show, Tom. Thank you, Tom. We were honored to have you. So despite our
regularly coming to Europe and riding a lot of trains... Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. And the nice thing about trains
is that they're not as exhausting. But this time,
you took a bunch of planes. We did.
As well. How are you feeling? Yeah. That has to have some—
had some impacts, right? Well, we're professionals.
We feel fine. The question for you, Tom,
is how are you feeling? Yeah, I wanna know
how Tom is feeling. Honestly... ...jet lagged. (group cheers) Waaa-hoo! He said the thing, Ben. Bye! He said the thing. See you in...
Bye! See you in season 14. Oh my god,
that's so many numbers. (grunts) Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Alright, let me try... Let's do a test of— Let's both crouch
in the bush. Three, two... Hello!
Hi. Welcome to
our secret hiding spot in New York City. I know— I know
it doesn't look like New York City but that's what makes it
a good hiding spot. We hope. Welcome to
Grand Central Terminal, the starting point for
our special one-off game of hide-and-seek
across NYC. But right now, it's 12:30. So you know
what that means, Ben. It's time to go, go, go!
It's time to go, go, go! Surprise!    Surprise!
Surprise! Happy birthday.
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.
Happy birthday. We got you a one off
episode of Jet Lag: The Game where we play hide-and-seek
in New York City. Just for you.
That is true. We wanted to see what
public transit in America was like. And we also,
as capitalist fiends, wanted to promote
our product, the home game. Therefore, we made this whole one-off special. Yeah!
Not a full season or anything. We have Amy, our colleague. Amy— Amy heads. Yeah.
Amy— If you watched this season, you know Amy wrote
the challenges for the season. And now she's on the game. It's pretty fun. I think it was actually
a really good round. Yeah, it genuinely
played out in a very fun way. It was pretty crazy. Here's what I will say though. That's not enough
to hold me over for the whole off-season. What if—
I'm gonna go crazy. What if, Ben...
What if. What if we had this whole
comedy debate show? What? Called
Abolish Everything!. Produced by
Wendover Productions, aka the producers behind
Jet Lag: The Game. What if I told you that you were on
the first episode of the show? I didn't know that. What if I told you I was on
the second episode of the show? I did know that. Yeah. There's so much going on
during this off-season. There's also all sorts of
other original stuff on Nebula that's come out recently,
and that's coming out soon. It's a big year
for Nebula Originals. But how do I watch, Sam? Well, you go to
www.nebula.tv/jetlag. Why do I do the ""/jetlag"" part? 'Cause that's our promo code.
That gets you 40% off. It gets me 40% off an annual
subscription to Nebula.TV? What does that bring
the cost to? $36 a year.
$36 a year? That's only $3 a month. You would be losing money to not do that right now. That's true.
I'm pretty sure that's the truth. Yeah. Anyway, go to
nebula.tv/jetlag. Do all the things
we just told you to do. Thank you for watching
this season. I hope you enjoyed it. Bye!
See you next time. Thank you!
Bye!"

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","F5ShDcJl4qQ","Hello and welcome
back to episode five of our race to claim
the most countries in Europe. Right now it's
the morning of day four and the score is 7-7. Ben and Adam finished yesterday at Leonardo da Vinci
International Airport in Rome after locking down
Italy and the Vatican. Their plan today is to fly
first thing to Amsterdam in an attempt to
steal the Netherlands. But Tom and I are
cautiously optimistic. Even though the Netherlands
is vulnerable because we failed to
lock it on day one, we think that the
Netherlands challenge is nearly impossible, meaning that Ben and Adam
might fly all the way there and get nothing
if they fail the challenge too. But whether or not they succeed,
Tom and I need to move quickly. We scooped up Denmark
and Sweden last night, but we haven't locked
either country yet. With Ben and Adam
making their way north, we'll need to do everything
we can to lock down at least one of our
Scandinavian territories. Otherwise, we'll set
Ben and Adam up for a devastatingly
easy back-to-back steal. So with all that on the line,
let's go ahead and see what the Sweden challenge
has in store. Oh, let's hope
this is good, Tom. The time is 7:33. Go. Find Amy a ""Jungelslog"". Find Amy a DJUNGELSKOG. This is actually perfect.
I desperately need a  DJUNGELSKOG. Could you help me out? Go to IKEA
and find a  DJUNGELSKOG within 25 minutes of
entering the store. You may not look up
what a  DJUNGELSKOG is, nor may you ask for
help from anyone else. You don't have to buy it, just text me a pic of
you and the  DJUNGELSKOG so I know it's in stock.
Thanks! You don't have to buy it. Just text me a pic of
you and the  DJUNGELSKOG, so I know it's in stock. Thanks.
Oh, IKEA's— I don't know if
IKEA's gonna be open. Oh, it might be
too early for IKEA. IKEA Malmö.
IKEA Malmö. Doesn't open until 10.
Oh, that's brutal! Are there any other IKEAs? 10 am. I think they're
all gonna be 10. I mean, they're not
the kind of things that are open early. That is really not good, but... That's not good because
that's a very easy challenge for someone who comes
here to steal the country. If you can find a  ""Junkelsvagiv"". IKEAs are pretty big. Yeah, they are. That's true. It's a time consuming one. 'Cause getting to
IKEAs on public transit Yes.
will take a little bit 'cause they're never
in city centers. And then you're gonna have
to search the entire IKEA. Not to say, I don't think
it's ultimately that difficult, but I think it is time consuming. It's a time was— yes,
but that doesn't matter if they're stealing Sweden.
No, but yeah. First impression,
it's not worth waiting two and a half hours for that. No, and I hate that! We keep having lousy luck
with challenges, Sam. Look, here's
what we should do now. We should head to Denmark.
Do that challenge. Just accept and
throw this one away? Well that's,
I guess that's the thing. We can't come back. No, we can't.
Ugh. We can only have one
challenge open at a time. As soon as we open
the Danish challenge, we have to call them and let them know that
Sweden is available. It's really not great,
but I think... I think we've gotta
operate on the theory of a single country is
not that attractive. It's a two-country pair
that's attractive. Yeah, and we've already
lost one of that pair. Yes. So, I mean, that means
we have to lock Denmark. Yeah. And in fact, Benjamin, here is our gate. We've made it. We will board this plane
to Amsterdam. Literally no
freaking problem at all. Oh, I hate this, Sam!
I hate this. Let's at least go one or two blocks
into the city there. So it looks like we got
meaningfully away from the station. So they look at
the tracker and go, ""Okay, they didn't just...""
Yeah. Okay, and should we... I think maybe we should be
out of breath or something. Yes, yes, absolutely. This is— these are not the circumstances
that I would want. No. But I think that a path
to victory at this point is that they go to
the Netherlands, fail. Then they come to Sweden...
And fail. 'Cause again, it's
not the easiest challenge. No, it's not.
Even once you get to an IKEA. No. Alright. Uh-oh, we are getting
a call from Sam. This can't be good. Hello, Sam and Tom. Hi. Uhh... I think they're
messing with us. Stop looking sad.
Are you tricking us? I think they're
messing with us. Unfortunately not. Whoa.
Sweden challenge failed. Sweden is vulnerable. Well, well, gentlemen,
I'm sorry about that. I mean, I'm thrilled about it,
but I am sorry. I hope that you sort of
continue to fail throughout the day, but I'll continue to
feel sorry about it. Okay, we gotta go, bye. Okay.
Okay, well, let's hope... Let's hope that's
enough misinformation to get 'em to come here
when they're in a rush. Let's hope that's
enough misinformation for them to think that this is
a luck-based, quick challenge that requires physical effort
and not time. Let's go get over
the Øresund Bridge. Yeah. And we're getting
on the freaking plane. Because we're unstoppable
and we can't be stopped. This is very, very interesting. This is very, very, very
interesting because— For two boys exactly like us, this is one of the
most interesting things that you could hear. Because we are
heading directly up there. Yes. It is very easy for us
to go to Sweden. And I would say that
almost certainly we should. We're doubling down
on the risk. Well, we'll see how this goes. We'll see what
happens in Amsterdam. Here.
Oh man. Allow me to
present to you a theory. They seemingly
started the challenge right when the day started.
Yes. That is the worst time
to start a challenge. It's true. Because if the challenge
is time limited, and it requires getting materials,
oftentimes everything is closed. So I think that
there is a possibility we would've a better chance
at the challenge if going there midday.
That is probably— Just to throw that out.
That is probably true. I also think that... it could have been
just impossible to do for a really long time,
and they forfeited it. Yeah.
So that they could keep moving. That's true.
I just don't know. They were at a... like basilica when they called us. I don't know if—
I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. We'll see what
they do in Denmark. 'Cause also they could
fail the Denmark one. Yeah. Agh, let's get to Denmark. Oh, I gotta hope that the
Denmark challenge is doable. Oh yeah.
And not too luck-based. Hey, we can look up
what a  ""Dunkel-skyog"" is now. Yeah, and maybe
how difficult it was. Yeah. Oh, well let's get on the train
and we'll do that. I bet it's one
of the plush toys. Yeah, yeah, very possible. I bet it's the plush bear. I bet you right now
that is the plush toy bear. Oh god. Is it the plush toy bear? Yeah, you're right.
(sighs loudly) That might be easy to guess.
Yeah. I just took our odds of
getting to the challenge to 100%, didn't I,
if we waited until 10 am? I don't know
where I dredged that from in the depths of my memory.
Well... But as soon as
the pressure was off, my brain went, plush toy bear
is called ""Dunkle-skyog"". Hopefully they're
not as familiar with IKEA plushes.
Ohhh! I'm infuriated I did not realise
about the bear earlier. Oh, that sucks! I'm not gonna lie, Tom.
That does suck. We can take here. Did we just make the wrong call? Well... As soon as I thought of bear, I'm like, did we make
the wrong call? Yeah, my thoughts
would've been different if... we thought we knew,
we had a strong theory, what the object was.
Yeah. Because I was thinking
it would just be any random thing. I remember, Ben wrote,
I'm pretty sure it was Ben, he wrote in a joke about the IKEA...
dolphin plushie or something? Yeah.
In an HAI video once. So I'm pretty sure that...
Yeah. Could have been Amy,
but I'm pretty sure... he knows about the IKEA
plushies and the... I think we're gonna
lose Sweden, Sam. Well... that's Gate A71.
Yep. The flight to Amsterdam is boarding out of...
You wanna guess? Gate 71.
A71. And the tracker... puts them at Gate A71.
Alright. I don't hate this, I mean. I— That's true. Here's what I'll decide
to like this, Tom. Okay. I don't think we have a good shot
of catching up to them if we're each just incrementally claiming one more country. I think our best shot is that they waste
all this time and budget going to somewhere and not successfully...
stealing our country. I think that's a great way
that we can catch up. Yeah. The problem is we just left
another one vulnerable. Yeah, we did. Very vulnerable. Bridge.
Bridge. Welcome back to Denmark.
Yeah. Welcome to Copenhagen. –Haagen? I wish we could do more planning,
but our flight options depend on how long this challenge takes,
and we have to take this challenge. 'Cause this is a situation
where we need to give this challenge the time it takes.
Yeah. And the time it, you know,
takes to give it its best shot. Yeah, absolutely. We can't... If we lose this country, Sam... We leave too much vulnerable. That's a nice tower thing. It is. That is Tivoli Gardens. That's the theme park. We may want to position ourself
more near a grocery store? I wonder if we want to
head to Helsinki after this. There's a 1 pm flight, which I think is likely
to be good timing for us. Yeah. Alright, Tom. Alright.
Are you sure we're in Denmark? We are definitely in Denmark. Okay. This has gotta be good. Oh.
This has gotta be good. This has gotta be good.
Should I pull it? Pull it. (groans) Build a LEGO set blind.
Build a LEGO set blind. Build a LEGO set blind. Denmark, the birthplace of LEGOs. Build a LEGO set
with at least 200 pieces in under 45 minutes, and for some good fun,
do it blindfolded! Only one team member
must be blindfolded. This team member must
do all the assembly. The other team member
may use the instructions to guide the blindfolded builder, but is not allowed to
assemble the LEGOs himself. He may move and touch
exactly one piece at a time as long as he doesn't
put pieces together or take them apart. Okay.
LEGO. Tough but doable, I think. Will there be a souvenir store
in there that sells LEGOs or is there a souvenir
store out there? Do you wanna check
the station first? Yeah, alright. Alright, more than that,
let's see if there's a LEGO store that opens at 9 am. 200 pieces. I mean, that's... LEGO Store
Copenhagen opens at 10. 200 pieces in 45 minutes.
That's only... five pieces a minute. That's a piece
every 12 seconds, Sam. Yeah. But with LEGO sets,
a lot of them are duplicates. Hopefully we could
find a kit... you know, one for young kids,
you know. Cosmetics. And this is a big station, so I think...
It is. I feel like there should be
a tourist shop in here. Yeah.
Lemme look at my phone. Worst case, the LEGO Store
opens at 10. Yeah, I don't
want to wait that long. I don't wanna wait that long. But if we do wait that long,
we only spend 45 minutes on LEGO. We could still make
a 1 pm flight to Helsinki. Yes. I mean, I was hoping to be
somewhere in the station that sold tourist things.
Oh, the airport would def— Oh, it'd be past security though.
I was gonna say. The airport would
definitely have some, but— And we can't
do challenges there. It would, yeah. And it would be duty free,
and we can't do challenges there. Okay. No tourist shops
at the station. All the department stores
are on the main street a little way that way,
past Tivoli. But they all open at 10.
Mm. They all open at 10. It'd be real neat if
this country had Walmarts. Tom and I spent quite a while looking for anywhere
that would sell us LEGOs this early in the morning, but kept finding that nowhere
would be open until 10. Sure be neat if that was open.
Yeah. We thought we might have
a shot at the airport, so we headed there. But had no luck in
the pre-security area. No LEGO. Worth a try. No LEGO. You'd think that
the country of LEGOs would have more LEGOs, Tom. (sighs deeply) Haven't seen a single LEGO yet. There was a LEGO Store
past security, but we figured that by the time
we could buy a ticket, get past security, get LEGOs, and get three miles
from the airport, it would be around time for
the LEGO Store in town to open. So we headed back to Copenhagen. Welcome to Copenhagen, Tom. (chuckles sardonically) Yeah. Welcome to
Copenhagen, Sam. I love Copenhagen. I just wish they had more
early morning stores. Yeah.
Some of us are early risers. Mhm. Some of us wake up
at 6 am and... Yeah. decide today's
the day to buy LEGO. Yeah.
And build a LEGO. Yeah. And this country is just
not accommodating of that. We still have 14 minutes. Maybe we should stare
through the window and see if we can
identify what we want. Yeah, alright. Okay. Is there a bigger LEGO shop within 12 minutes' walk?
I don't know. I mean, this has
an upstairs, I think. Yeah, it does. These would be complicated.
I don't think we want the flowers. They have a mosaic maker. What if we make a custom set? It takes a photo. You just have to put
the pieces on the right place. If we get... This is cheeky.
Black out the screen? This is cheeky.
Get an all-black mosaic. We just gotta make sure
it's got 200 pieces. It will give us 200 tiny dots
and a place to put 'em on. I think... surely! They're unlocking
the doors, alright. Let's see what we can get. Hello.
Hello. Okay, let's have a look.
Touch to start. Oh, okay, we need to buy one. We should ask to figure out
how the mosaic thing works. Sign in. Do I need
a LEGO account for this? (chuckles softly)
Yes. How many pieces
do you think this is? Well, hang on,
let's have a look. That is... 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. That is 50 by 50, so that's... Wait, that can't be right. That would be like... 50 by 50 would be
2,500 pieces? I guess.
Yeah, that could be right. Yeah.
That would be... The alternative is, what's the easiest
200-piece set in here? 200, just 200? Oh, it's gotta be at least 200. But ideally no more than 200. Can you check this one? This one looks maybe...
Yeah, okay. Relatively simple. 252. 252. I don't think— We're gonna waste time
if we spend any longer, Sam. Do you wanna get this one? Oh.
Oh, this one looks pretty good. Oh, yeah. No, that's— That doesn't have
working suspension. 214.
Oh. Bit less.
Oh, let's try that one. Let's go – 214. I think this one's pretty good. Alright, let's do it. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Let's go assemble some LEGO. Okay. Let's go do this challenge. Welcome to Amsterdam. Now, I had LEGO as a kid, but I've never, ever followed
the instructions, not once. How about you? I mean, I've built LEGO sets
following the instructions. Okay, so are you... I think you should
read the instructions. You are better at methodical
and not panicking than I am
in situations like this. So, read the instructions,
gimme things to put together. Okay, let's find a nice
quiet corner in the station. Alright. Tucked in behind
the model railway? Let's do it. Okay.
45 minute timer is ready. Let me test my blindfolding. Okay, let me try to
organize these somewhat. Yeah. Well that's an effective blindfold. When you lay it
all out like that, Tom, it's a good number of...
It's a really good number. I don't like this at all.
45 minutes. Alright, well... I can't see anything.
Like, I can... (imitates punch) (giggles) You see that? You made a noise.
Okay. So I can sort of
see vague lights above... I was testing whether
you would flinch when I... Did I? No, tried punching you.
No, you didn't. Alright, well,
I can't see a thing, so... I suppose this is
as ready as we'll be, Tom. Alright, well you're
gonna have to start a timer 'cause I can't use
my phone anymore. I'm a little nervous, Tom.
Yeah, so am I. I'm a little nervous.
This 45 minutes is gonna suck. Gotta stay calm.
Gotta be methodical. Yep.
Ready to start? Yep. And we are starting. Give me pieces.
Tell me what to do. Okay, first we're
doing the mini figure. I'm gonna hand you the legs.
Here are the legs. Yes.
Here's the body. Here's the head. Is that the
correct way 'round? No, that is. Here's the head. Okay, mini figure, done. Alright, now I'm handing you
one piece of a dolphin. Okay. And this one's
gonna be a little tricky 'cause it's non-traditional,
but you need to slide this onto the face of the dolphin. It's kind of an articulating face. Rotate by 90 degrees,
in front of you. Like that?
Yep. Got it. Okay.
Done. Alright, now go all the way
to the bottom of the long piece. Got it.
Yep. Now put this on centered. Excellent instructions, Sam. Really excellent instructions.
Thank you. Alright, buddy. Let's get three miles
away from this place. I think we really
want to be situated as centrally as we can. Yep, for sure. And then we can go ahead,
and open this guy. See, I'm so scared.
I know. I mean, I don't know
what it is that they failed. What's fun is that
you, the audience, you do know
what this challenge is. Right, you know
exactly what's going on. And you might have been
screaming at your screen for hours, ""Don't go to Amsterdam.
This challenge is too hard."" But we don't know that. We simply don't know.
We can't hear you! Okay, now put this... Sorry, feel for the side. What?
Feel, where your... Sorry, this is hard to describe.
Down, down. Feel the middle.
Here? Now feel for the side.
Here? Yes. Now you're putting this
at the bottom, one lane of bricks in. Here? Rotate 90 degrees.
Here. One lane in.
Here. At the bottom.
Go down, go down, go down. There?
Yes, that's right. That is correct.
Yep. Okay.
Now put this... On the other side just here?
Away from you, up. Yep. One lane in. There.
Yep. Now you're replicating what
we just did on the left side. There?
Yes. Yeah?
And here's the next piece. There? Yes.
Okay. Okay. Such good instructions, Sam. Thank you.
Thank you, Tom. I will say... it's one of only two challenges
that have been failed. Most challenges have been
successfully completed. But guess how many
challenges we've completed? All of 'em. Okay, now towards you. This is going to the side.
All the way to the side. So, there?
Yeah... I think one up? Yes, that looks right.
It's a little bit tricky. Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on. There?
Yep. Right there, okay.
Yep. Same thing left side.
Same thing left side. Yep.
Alright, we're doing well, Tom. God, I hope the
camera's still rolling. Okay, now this piece is— Hold on, those feel uneven.
Oh yeah, sorry. The left one needs to
go one towards you. Oh, that was lucky. No, up, up, up. Sorry. Out kind of... No, no, on top of that
kind of bit that you just did. Yep, that's right. Try to lock it down at the top. This, wait,
what the (bleep) just happened? Something just happened.
Oh, sorry. I missed a step.
I missed a step. Okay, okay.
I'm gonna take— I'm gonna be honest, Tom.
We need to move quickly. Yeah, I know.
So I'm just saying like... I know, I know, I'm... Okay.
Trains. People brought
balloons to greet us. Alright. Off to Amsterdam Centraal. Whew. Oh boy, I hope this goes well. Okay, that's...
A little to the right. There you go. There you go. Now this is going on top
on the little nubs. There? One to the right. Ugh, sorry, the piece
I just did was wrong. Rotate 90 degrees to the left. There.
Yes. Down, down, down. Up, up, up, up, up. Down a little bit.
Up a little bit. Up, up, up, up, up.
One more. One more down towards you. Yep.
There, okay. Oh, sorry, no, one up. Left. One to the right.
Like that? Yes. I can't see how that la— I can't see anything.
I can't feel how that latches. I—
There. No. What?
One to the right. There.
Yep. Got it.
Alright, now put the car down. Yep.
We're going to put... this on the top right. Yep. Actually, did I get
that right? Yep. And... (phone timer rings) Aaaggh! (sighs) We couldn't have done
that any faster, Sam. I, we... We could not have
done that any faster. We gave that our best shot. I mean, look. How close were we? It's not that much,
which I honestly wish it was more because then Ben and Adam
would have a harder time. That's not good, Tom.
No, it's not. That's not good.
I'm not gonna lie. I'm not— that's not good.
It's not good. The short of finding a LEGO set that was just clunk,
clunk, clunk, clunk, we could not have
done that any faster. At least it's
far from a sure shot, because I do feel like... we assembled that
as well as we could. Maybe Ben and Adam, you know, they've done
a lot of these together. Maybe they can figure out
how to communicate. They are, unsurprisingly,
in the Netherlands. We've gotta give 'em a call
and then we've gotta get in a plane. Well, let's be
sure not to show them Yeah— wall.
what the thing is. Oh, they look happy.
Gentlemen. No, they don't look happy.
It is... Not gonna lie. We're not doing well.
Denmark has not been locked. Oh my god.
Denmark is vulnerable. Oh, boys! That is a—
That's tough news for you. Enjoy the Netherlands.
We gotta go. Bye. Bye. Oof. I feel like I was really
excited to gloat last time. That one,
you feel a little bad. That one,
you gotta feel a little bad. Oh, boys. I feel bad. In another way... I feel amazing.
I feel really... In another sense.
I feel really good. Okay, Tom. We don't have too long.
No. Are we going to Helsinki?
I think we have to. I don't think we have
any other options, Sam. I think it's their best option.
And then... And then when
we get there, we decide... if we're booking on a flight onwards
once we get to the airport. But we can't book
a connecting flight because that means
we won't claim Finland. Yeah. We need a single
ticket to Finland. We can only hold
one ticket at a time. We go to Helsinki, Sam. We have nothing else!
Okay. Well that flight leaves
in an hour and 45. So we can make it.
We can do that. We can do that. We can do that. But we need to go quickly. Alright! Let's go quickly. This is really strange,
but this is— We just had to try
and complete this. If the kid would like a LEGO set,
you are welcome to it. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. It's mostly assembled, but... It's mostly assembled. But you know what?
She's a parent. She's had to deal with
bigger messes than that. Let's get to the train. At the very least, that's a
really difficult challenge. There's a chance
they lose Sweden. There's a very strong chance they lose this and waste
a lot of time doing it. Yeah, there's even
a chance they lose both and waste a ton of time
doing both. Yes. So, I mean—
There are two adults, now. I don't love that
as our best shot, but... 11:30, can we make—
We can make 11:30. We can make that. Honestly, there's some
weird version of the plot of the next couple days...
Where they follow us and fail. Where they foll— where
they fail the Netherlands, follow us here, fail both,
waste a ton of time, and in that time we've caught up.
It'd be a weird plot. Here's the thing, it's still,
despite all our grumbles, what's the score? 7–7.
7–7. Knowing that
Jet Lag: The Game is scripted and the most improbable scenario
always happens, I think that they fail all three and that gets us in the lead
and we win, Tom. I think the moral of the season
is gonna be the downfall of hubris, Tom. They're gonna have hubris. Here... I will say though. Just because they
failed the challenges doesn't mean that we will
succeed at the challenges. Doesn't it?
But we're gonna. ♪ But we're gonna ♪ Alright.
Alright. Please tell me
the flight hasn't sold out. Nope, it's available. Alright, how much? However many
3,278 Danish kroner are. Alright. That's for both— Wait, for one or both of us?
Both. Okay, yeah, that's affordable.
We can do that. There's our train. What time is our flight? One. We can make that.
It'll be a bit of a rush, but security shouldn't be
too bad this time of day. I imagine that there is one
perfect LEGO set out there that would make that possible.
Probably. But if there is,
we didn't find it. Okay.
Alright, Ben. Let's get out. Yes, let's get out of the train station.
Into somewhere accessible. Yep. And then,
we'll pull our challenge. And here we are. You can definitely
set up a full shot. Okay.
Alright. Welcome to Amsterdam. Beautiful Amsterdam. Let's find out what the
Netherlands challenge is that Sam and Tom failed. You ready? Yeah. Build Jason his dream bouquet. Build Jason his dream bouquet. The Netherlands are
known for many things. It's not just bikes. Indeed, the Netherlands are
the flower shop of the world. So please assemble the bouquet
of Jason from Not Just Bikes' dreams to his precise specifications. Complete and send Jason
a picture of your bouquet within 30 minutes,
or you fail this challenge. Your time starts
the next time you touch a flower. You may not do any research,
flower acquisition, or assembly until then. Okay, let's watch that video. Okay. Oh, it's Jason.
Welkom in Nederland. Thanks for
helping me out here. Okay. I always wanted
a flower bouquet with at least six carnations
Six carnations. of three different colors,
Three different colors. two orange gerberas,
Two what? a Christmas Rose,
and an Alstroemeria. Christmas Rose?
What the hell is a Christmas Rose? And all filled out
with some Mimosa. That was
so many things, Jason. Oh, he had a lot of
flowers that he wanted. That sounds hard as(bleep)
That sounds impossible. I've never— I've all, I've— The only one of those
I've heard of is a carnation. And I guess I've heard of roses, but I don't know what
a Christmas Rose is. What's a Christmas Rose? I don't know
the answer to that. Okay. We are not allowed to do
any research or anything. We gotta touch a flower, and... I think that scoping out Amsterdam
would be research. So I think we just have to
touch the next flower we see. I mean, look,
30 minutes, I bet— We're in Amsterdam!
There's got— There's— Theoretically there should
be no city in the world that you have a better chance
of finding a bunch of flowers. Let's find a flower, I guess. Oh man, I can see
why they failed this. Yep. Okay.
Okay. So we gotta go touch a flower,
and then our 30 minutes can begin. Sam, I have news. The lads are in
Amsterdam Centraal. Mhm.
They're at the main station. That is a logical place
to pull a challenge. Yep. I have bad news,
which is that... there are a lot of florist shops within easy walking distance
and running distance. Well, only some of those
are actually that close to Centraal. Yeah. There's at least one, two,
three, four they could rea— Yeah. If they really
put the hammer down, and they run and they sprint and they desperately
go into florist shops... Mhm. To be honest, I thought there
would be even more than that. They get to roll the dice
a lot of times. They do. They do. And our guy
in Maastricht said that maybe somewhere would
have it in Amsterdam. Yeah, it certainly is
a lot easier of a challenge in central Amsterdam
than Maastricht. Those are flowers. Those are definitely flowers. They're definitely real. Okay. Alright.
Alright, you ready? I'm ready. Three, two, one, go. Okay, florists.
Alright, let's look up florists. Let's start walking this way
while we look. This place, Jemi, it's open. Okay, it's a
seven minute walk. Let's move. You've got it? You've got— Yeah, I got it. You know where it is? Okay. I think there's no jaywalking
in this country, so... No, (bleep), no.
We actually need to cross here. Oh, come on! Aaaaahhh... Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Okay.
Here we go. We have unwittingly
and unwillingly laid a trap for them. It's not a good trap. It's really not a good trap. But at least they
are failable challenges. If luck decides to
swing on our side. If no one in Amsterdam has Christmas Roses in January. Ohh. I guess they're about
to find out. Oh! Look! Maybe these are just common
flowers in the Netherlands. I certainly hope so. Oh yeah, okay, it's right here. Here? Okay. Alright. Let's see what they got. Hi.
Hello. We are doing... a scavenger hunt
and we need to get these flowers. I might have spelled
some of them wrong. I only have the... the two Gerberas.
Only those? Yeah.
Okay, can I have— Can we get those please?
Yeah. You have no carnations?
Yes. Okay, we need six carnations,
three different colors. Well, I've got two colors. Okay, then we'll take
two of each, please. Two of each?
Yes, please. Do you have any mimosas?
No. Do you have
a Christmas Rose? Uhh, no. No. Do you have— Christmas is...
Yes. Yeah.
Two weeks ago. Any ideas where
we could find those? Nearest flower shop
is closed until Monday. You can try the new market. We're the only florist
in the neighborhood. Okay, okay, thank you. Just need to start to
figure out the back— How much time do we have left?
We have 20 minutes left. Thank you.
Okay, thank you. Okay. Okay, so the nearest one... Is Flower Design.
that's open is Flower Design. But the question is,
does that look like it's gonna have more flowers than
Florist 't Lievertje? I think we're—
Here's what I think. We should go... There's three all next
to each other up there. So we should go this way.
Okay, you know the way? Yep. We really gotta move. Tom, do you want to know
what the weather's like in Helsinki? What's the weather
like in Helsinki? Snow! Is there any risk
of us getting snowed in? No. Oh, welcome back to
Copenhagen Airport, Sam. I love Copenhagen Airport. There are worse airports. Alright, ""låts gätes"". I don't know the
Swedish for ""let's go"". This airport is like... an eight outta ten. Yeah. Oh, it's
a solid airport. I just— You know what'd make
it a nine outta ten? A LEGO Store?
A pre-security LEGO Store. Yeah.
Every— Oh, oh. Sam, Sam. We're gonna get through security, and there's gonna be a LEGO Store
just taunting us. I— We cannot look
in that LEGO Store because it will— we— I just know it'll have an
easy 200 piece puzzle in it. Yeah, I bet it will have a 200-piece block.
Yep. Helsinki, go to terminal two. 13:00 to Helsinki, right? Yeah.
Terminal two. What are they up to
on the tracker, Tom? Heh. Well, they're still... I don't know if it's running, but I can see Adam's dot
moving down the street. So they haven't
found all the things yet. At speed. We're definitely gonna make it
to the second florist, okay? Yeah. And there's two other ones
right next to them. Maybe there's... Because a Christmas Rose, he was like,
""Well, it's not Christmas."" Well, I live in enormous fear
that the Christmas Rose is because we were supposed to
be playing this in December. Oh (bleep), yeah. Tom.
Good news. The lads are still on the move. Tom, look at this.
Still moving fast. Bad news.
Tom. We found the LEGO shop.
Tom, look at this one. This one would've been doable. And that one
would've been doable. Aw no. Awwh. Yeah.
That's annoying. That's annoying. Oh, that's not good. It's not good. Hopefully they're not... they don't think to
go to the bigger one. I hope they're
panicking about florists. I think they're
at this florist, apostrophe-T ""Leeverche"".
Oh good, yeah, okay. Yep. That's almost certainly not how
you pronounce that, but yeah. But it does, it looks like, I don't know if that's
actually a florist that... Oh, I guess...
It's a little florist stand. Yeah, but that's selling... That's not flowers. Those are seeds.
Oh, no, that's selling seeds. Huh. That's a plant shop,
not a florist. Maybe, yeah. Oh, they do not have a lot. That's very limited. Let's take a look here.
Let's just ask this lady. Hello. We're doing a scavenger hunt. We need to get... two carnations,
a Christmas rose, and mimosa. I don't have
the Christmas Rose. None of those?
Do you have— no mimosa? No.
No Christmas Rose? Maybe they have
it at the flower market. Okay.
Maybe. Okay, which way? Okay. She says to go to
the end of the street. Okay. Yeah, there's another one
right down there. Okay. Maybe this place
will have what we need. Oh, man. They're moving. They're moving. They're not finding
the seasonal things. They are moving so fast! Oh, this— This is— oh, this— I can't.
Oh, they're moving more now. They've left that shop.
They've realised it's seeds. Okay, they're still on...
Yeah. Okay, where
are they going next? There are a bunch
of florists there, so they're gonna have
a lot of options. They can't have
that much time left. No, I don't think so. We didn't clock when
they started it, but... Alright.
We still got 11 minutes, Ben. It should be right
around here, right? Is it that across the street? Oh, the flower market. Is that it? Oh, that is a flower market. That is several. Yeah, that... I mean,
if they can make it there... If they can make
it there in time... That will have probably a shot. Let's hurry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's hurry. Oh, they have
so many flowers there! Okay. Go quick, go quick. Oh, come on. Come on, baby. Oh, they've gotta have 'em here.
Okay, okay, okay, okay. We need to find somebody. You work on finding somebody.
I'm gonna look. They have— Those are Gerbera. Excuse me. Do you have mimosa? No? Do you have
Christmas Roses? Hi, do you have
a Christmas Rose? Any Christmas Rose? No.
No? Okay. You have carn— We are
done with Christmas. Okay, okay. No, no, okay, next one. No, this isn't really flowers. This is like... Flower themed stuff. These are bulbs. Yeah, let's just keep looking maybe. Everybody, when we ask them
for a Christmas Rose, goes, ""No, we are done with Christmas.
You dummies."" Those are just seeds. These are all seeds. Do Christmas Roses
have any other name? They do. Six minutes. They're Helleborus, black hellebore. I mean, there's more. Yeah, these are all, yeah.
It's all flower themed stuff. It's like mocking us. How are they doing? So they're in an area
that's called ""the Flower Market"". Okay.
As in like... the address that shows
""Flower Market"". Okay.
So... But they're still moving? They're still
moving down this line. So they haven't found
it yet, I don't think. Okay. Are they just yelling,
""Has anyone got Christmas Rose?"" Yeah, Adam would
totally do that. To vendor after
vendor after vendor? Yeah, that sounds
exactly right. Are they making
a scene in Amsterdam? That's their specialty. Hi, do you have
any Christmas Roses? No.
Do you have Mimosa? No, okay. This is crazy. This is all... It's all flower themed. But no one has
a Christmas Rose! This— Wait, oh, this is plants.
This place has some... Okay, this has some stuff,
but there's nobody here. Look for labels.
Well... Helleborus.
Helleborus? That's Christmas Rose. Yeah.
Okay, okay, okay, okay. So let's see if they
have the other stuff. Christmas Rose there. So then we just need mimosa
and two more carnations. Why is there nobody here?
Why is there nobody here? Okay. Oh, hi.
Hi. Do you have mimosa? No, we don't have—
No, okay. Do you have carnations?
No. No, okay.
Anything else? No, no.
No, that's okay. Okay. Okay, if we could find
mimosa and carnations somewhere else—
Those are so much more common. we could bring it back there. But the first place
didn't have those? Carnation is easy.
The mimosa is the problem. One minute, 20 seconds. I mean... Yeah, I think that's it. No. These are all dried. (phone timer pings)
That's it. That's it. That's it. Man! Okay. Okay. Incoming call.
What do you think it is, Tom? Moment of truth.
Let's see if they got a bouquet. Lads. Yeah, they... Christmas Roses are outta
season, it turns out. Yeah. We found one though.
We learned that, actually. Yeah, we learned that
the hard way. Yeah. So, I assume you're
not just baiting us. No, we're not
messing with you. That'd be too much.
You guys have had a hard day. We have not
stolen the Netherlands. That's tough. That's tough. That's your first
challenge failure, isn't it? It is.
Yeah. Sorry, gents. That's tough. Bye.
There we go. That's what we needed.
It's still 7-7. (chuckles) You know what'd be nice? They fly here, they do
the Sweden challenge first. And they pull
the Sweden challenge at about the same time we did. Oh yeah. Because I feel like
if you come here, the intuitive thing is,
oh, you're in Denmark. Do Denmark first.
Yeah. And then head over
to Malmö for the morning. And if you get there
first thing in the morning, you're not gonna be able to
do it for a couple of hours. Yeah.
So here's the thing. It's 12:30.
Yeah. It's halfway
through the game day. And they have made zero progress. That's true. They've made
negative progress, Tom. 'Cause they've spent flight budget. It's still 7–7. I still kind of think, I hope they come here,
because... It's the obvious play for them. There's a lot of flights
to Copenhagen. There's a lot of flights
out of Copenhagen. I still think
it's our best shot. And they have... if they boss both challenges,
they go up by two, we go down by two. But I think simultaneously them wasting the time
of coming here... Yeah.
and failing them is our best shot of
getting in the lead. Alright, well we gotta
get back to the airport 'cause there is still time for us to challenge Denmark That sucks.
and Sweden today, okay? I mean, here's what
I'll say this really proves. The failed challenges...
Are hard. Are hard.
That's why they were failed. Yep.
Let's just get to the airport. I think that we need
to go to Copenhagen. Yeah. Oh, Ben! I can't believe you
found a Christmas Rose. (laughs) I know! That was the one I thought
we were never gonna find. How you feeling, Adam? Really bummed out. Yeah.
'Cause here's the thing. They've failed challenges... but they haven't failed a steal. If you fail to challenge
in a country you claim, you might keep it,
as we just saw. They failed the
Netherlands challenge. Actually, that has ended up
to be great for them because they still
get the Netherlands and we wasted
half a day coming here. Hopefully the same does not go
for Denmark and Sweden. We will see. We have to get
at least one of them. Yeah. Oh, Ben, that's such a bummer! I look so sad
with my sad bouquet. I know.
It's like... It's tough to look sad
with a bouquet. I agree.
Because then it looks— One of the
saddest possible images. Then it looks like
you were scorned by a lover.
A lover, yeah. And in a sense we were, but our lover... was Lady Luck. Okay, well, you know,
game remains tied. Not for long. But you gotta imagine that
they are about to fly somewhere. Probably to Helsinki. Screwed that, shut up. I do like being in the...
in Scandinavia. Jet Lag Scandinavia has
been highly requested. But it's so nice in these countries.
Yeah. Maybe do it in summer. In fact, ideally,
do it in the three weeks between snow season
and mosquito season. These are flowers.
Look, flowers. I don't even
want to know if they— No, I don't want—
Let's not look, let's not look. It's gonna do psychic damage.
Don't look. Do not look at those flowers.
I have to ask. Excuse me. Do you have mimosas? Yep. Yep. They've got mimosas here. I think those are mimosas. I told you not to look. Let's go get you a cone of fries. Time is valuable at this point. Which does bring us
to the other strategy that you've thought about. Just speedrunning. Just keep flying. Well...
How much budget do we have? I almost have it worked out. Almost $2,500 left.
It's pretty generous. For two more
game days after this. I mean, I think we could take
pretty much any flight we want with that. Mind you, so can they. So the question is, Sam... if we change strategy so that we are just
bouncing between countries as fast as we can,
clock up every single one, we need to reach countries twice as fast as
they can claim them. I don't know how crazy that is. I don't either. There's an argument for
just using the budget Because again, keep in mind.
and bouncing. They don't need it. The precise order that we go... To steal the countries back, they have to go in
the precise order we go. But they can't
take the connections because they need to
get out the airport. Right.
Do the challenge, head back. And as we've seen, the flights
only happen every once in a while. Anyway.
It's a plan. Let's research more. Oh, that is pretty. We got consolation fries. Mm, that's a fun phrase. Consolation fries? Oh, it's like
consolation prize. Oh my god, okay.
We invented a new thing. Consolation fries. They look— I guess they— I already ate mine,
but they were really good. They're not the
most beautiful object, but they do taste good. Look, Ben. This has been an enormous setback. But we got two more shots.
Two more shots. And then we'll be okay. Off to the airport, then. Let's go. We got some countries to steal. I got the moving one.
Mine doesn't work. Oh, the legs are starting to... Starting to feel it?
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Seems like security
is quick once again. Okay, well, Sam's tracker
actually just got pinged right over the central
Baltic Sea there, so... It would appear that
he and Tom are in fact going to Helsinki. Yeah, I mean,
that's what we expected. My hope is, my deep hope is that they... will only get to Helsinki and then they'll have some dead time
at the end of the day that they can't use
for anything helpful. I think that that may be, in fact exactly what
is about to happen. That's the hope. We'll see. Meanwhile, all they
can do is sit by and watch as we snatch up
two of their countries. God, I hope we snatch up
two of their countries. At least one of their countries.
Yeah. We need at least one of 'em.
We gotta get one of those two. We gotta get Denmark or Sweden. Oh boy. It looks like the lads
are at gate B17. That puts them on
the 2:55 to Copenhagen. Okay.
That's flight 548. That gets them in at... 4:15 local. Either way, they can't achieve
either of those challenges before... 11 local tomorrow? Well, they can't
complete them, yeah. Yeah. They'd have enough
time to get anywhere. They could get to either
Malmö or here, but... Yeah.
Actually, they couldn't— I don't think they
could get to Malmö and all the way to IKEA. No, they couldn't. That would be funny. Oh. That would be funny. But if they pull it off, it's worth effectively
two countries to them. Yes, but let's just say
it wastes a lot. It would still be funny, yes.
It wastes a lot of their time. Yeah, it definitely is
a lot better for them if they go into Copenhagen first.
Yeah. Alright. Off to Copenhagen. So I think that we are
gonna go straight to Malmö. Yeah, because
our leading theory as to why they failed the
Sweden challenge so early is that it was
so early in the morning, and whatever it was
they needed to do, they couldn't do
'cause it was closed. Yeah, I mean, that's
all we have to go off. All we know is that
they did it first thing. And so we figure probably best to not
try it first thing. The last thing you should do
is exactly what they did. Yeah. Okay, here we go. Snow on the ground, Sam. Oh wow, that is
not much visibility. No, I'm surpris— Honestly? The camera can't focus.
I'm surprised we... Oh, that is, wow. The camera is
slightly out of focus, but that's also just... a lot of fog. This one I feel like
definitely deserves lasers. Yeah. Sent. I think I need to
remind 'em of the score. Yeah, yeah, you do. Okay, well... Well, we're on
our plane to Copenhagen. Just before we were
about to take off... they have claimed Finland. Which does
Puts them in the lead. put them in the lead. Look, all we have to do
is focus on stealing Sweden and Denmark.
Yeah. If we can steal
Sweden and Denmark, it would put us in a
really good position. If we fail both of them, I would say it would put us
in kind of a horrible position. Then we are in
a lot of trouble. But that'll— That won't happen. Score's 8–7.
We're winning. That is—
Stop the count, Tom. That is 15 countries.
Stop the count. Welcome to Helsinki, Sam. Cool. It is properly snowing. It is properly snowing. You know what the Finnish word
for airport or airfield is? Flughafen? No, no.
That's German. Lentokenttä. Okay, that's a fun fact. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Should we... find the train? Yeah, I think
the only option here. We've got, there's no... There's no flight we can take
that gets us anywhere with good onward
connections for the game. Yeah. We can't reasonably get
to Riga or Vilnius or Tallinn or anywhere tonight. And I think... I mean, we can
get to some of 'em. There just isn't anywhere
to go from there. And I think
we've decided that... the ferry is not as efficient
as we maybe originally thought. No, because you've
gotta check in early. Yeah.
And then... And then it's two hours. It's just as
slow as the flight. And it takes you, you know,
out into not downtown. Yeah. So let's try and lock Finland. Yeah. And then research where
we want to go to tomorrow. Any guesses what
the Finnish challenge is? Surely we have to
Finnish something, right? Oh yeah. Moomins. Okay, yeah.
I could see Moomins. We've already had a challenge
involving a cute teddy bear. I think we're gonna
have to finish eating a Moomin. Well, let's get
tickets into town. Okay. This is a long ass escalator. It's a long ass
pair of escalators, Sam. I've been down here before. This is so peaceful. Why is it so deep? Give us some tunnel facts, Tom. Gimme some what? Gimme some tunnel facts.
Tunnel facts? Yeah. Why is this so deep? I dunno. I believe it's... they're definitely taxiing.
Okay. Assuming they're
on this flight. If anyone was thinking,
oh, you know, sunset. Must be near the
end of the game day. It's 4 pm Finnish time.
It is 3 pm Central European Time. There are still two and a half hours
left in this game day. Let's lock Finland, Sam.
Let's do it. Alright. Helsinki, Sam. A light dusting
of cold sleet... I think is the weather. It's lovely here.
How you feeling? Amazing. I love Helsinki. I've been here a few times. Alright.
I love Finland. Big Scandinavia fan. One of the best areas
of the world. Especially 'cause
I blend in so well. (cackles) The problem here is that
when I talk to people, sometimes even when
I respond in English, they'll still respond in
Finnish or Swedish Yep.
or whatever. Because I so look the part. It's crazy to think that
until a couple years ago, you could take... I think it was a three or four hour, high-ish speed train from here all the way to St. Petersburg. Wow! And that was only
a couple years ago. Yeah. When they left
from this station. Yep. Very different world now. I think this train station
is awesome. This is a good train station.
I've been here before. Big fan.
Yeah. Simple, but cool. Pull it, Sam. Alright. Win level one of Angry Birds.
Win level one of Angry Birds. Win level one of Angry Birds. Did you know Angry Birds
is from Finland? In this challenge,
you must construct and pass the first level of Angry Birds IRL. That means you must create/acquire
birds, a slingshot, a pig, and the 14-block structure
the pig is in. You must knock the pig
to the ground/floor by firing each of your three birds
at it/the structure. If you do not do it after firing
all three birds, you fail. You get one attempt,
but may practice. I think this is one that's good to take our time on actually, so...
Yes. We don't have to knock
all the blocks down. Just the pig. That's doable, okay.
Okay. I reckon we should look
for the closest hardware store. Yeah, agreed, let's do that. Because I think
that's gonna have the highest likelihood
of the blocks. And I think the blocks
we want to be pretty blocky. 'Cause to be able to
build this structure... Yeah, it needs to
be able to support a pig. Look for a toy store as well. Yeah, a toy store
could be good. Lot of lovely lights. So it looks like they should
be landing any minute now. Alright. What we can hope for
in terms of logic is that they knew that we did
the Malmö one pretty quick, whereas it took us a while
to do the Copenhagen one. So they might figure,
""Oh, that's one that we can complete by the end of the day.
Great, let's go over there."" And then they get there and they find they
can't get to an IKEA before the end of the game day. And they can't
go back to Denmark without losing the challenge.
Yeah. Yeah. So then they're
stuck there for... three hours of game day.
Yeah. And then they have to go back
and do the time waster in Denmark. Oh, here's hoping, Sam.
Here's hoping. All the stars are
going to align, Tom. (laughs) Welcome to... Denmark. I already forgot where we are. Alright, let's get our bags
so we can get off the plane early. Yep. Okay, we have four minutes. When's the next train? Well, there's
one in 15 minutes. My worry is if we
have to take that one, what if we don't have
time for the challenge? Three minutes.
We gotta go to the Tog. Ooh, yeah, okay. ""Hesing-board"" C.
Or no, that's flights. That's flights. Sorry, sorry. This is track one. I know, but I can't figure out
what track this is on. It says Malmö.
Malmö? Okay, great.
Let's assume it's this. The 16:14, track one? Perfect. Alright, nice work. We'll have plenty of time
to do the challenge. Yeah. And they failed
it in just 15, so... Right. We'll have
about 50 minutes if we go to Central,
which we probably should. How much time
do we buy ourselves if we didn't? About 10 minutes. It's probably not worth it. Let's go to Malmö Central. Once again. Audience, is this—
You know! Is the Sweden challenge
too hard? We don't know. Maybe. Or maybe they messed it up
for some stupid reason. I think we'll find out soon. We need this one. Yep. What's it gonna be? I'm just really hoping that... They just biffed it. They just biffed it super hard.
Yeah. Alright. Clas Ohlson. We—
(gasps in fright) Sam!
What? Sam, they're in Malmö! They've gone to Sweden.
Oh. Oh, Ben, Adam. Oh! No, hold on, hold on, hold on. They still have how long
left in the game day? They've got less than an hour. They won't make it
all the way to IKEA. Are you sure? Okay, let's just get up here. Let's just see
what the deal is. All we can do is
see what the deal is. Okay.
Hej. Welcome to Sweden. This country has suffered greatly
over the last 24 hours under the iron fist of Sam and Tom Scott.
But we are about... to put an end to that
with a steal. Okay.
Are you ready? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Find Amy a DJUNGELSKOG. Find Amy a DJUNGELSKOG.
This is actually perfect. I desperately need a DJUNGELSKOG.
Could you help me out? Go to IKEA and
find a DJUNGELSKOG within 25 minutes of
entering the store. You may not look up
what a DJUNGELSKOG is, nor may you ask for
help from anyone else. You don't have to buy it. Just text me a pic of
you and the DJUNGELSKOG so I know it's in stock.
Thanks! Okay, but IKEA won't be
open tomorrow morning, which means we need to
get there really fast. Take a look.
That must be why they failed. Please, please tell me that IKEA's easy to get to. (bleep bleep) It's gonna take
28 minutes to get there. It's back where we were before. We can get there. Okay, let's hurry. There's one in two minutes. What platform? It's hard to tell. It's to... Pågatågen. Track 1B, 1B. We need to get to 1B.
How do we do that? Uh-oh. That's not good. When does the train leave? In one minute.
Okay. Sorry, in two minutes. Okay, let's see
if we can get that. Better than one.
Sorry. 1A, 1A. 1A, over here, over here,
over here, over here. Amy, we're gonna get
you that ""Jungle-skok"" or whatever it's called. What is that? That doesn't seem right. Malmö. Okay. 1B. (bleep), it was 1B. Can we get to 1B? 1B? Go, go to 1B! Go to 1B! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Hey there, little boy. Did you know that the
season finale of Jet Lag: The Game is up right now on Nebula? The season finale, you could
find out who wins right now. Tall, tall man, is that true? Is that true that the
season finale is up right now? Because I've never heard
of such a thing. It is true. I'm so tall because the
season finale is so big, right? And so this reflects that. And also, you can trust me
on account of how tall I am. The season finale is up
right now on Nebula, little boy. Is there anything else
good on Nebula? I bet not. I bet that there actually is
all kinds of good stuff, like the Layover podcast, where we recap every episode
of Jet Lag: The Game but also stuff like
Abolish Everything!, a Nebula Original comedy
debate show that we're producing, and The Getaway,
a show that we made where it's like The Traitors, but everybody's a traitor
and they don't realize that. And also original movies
like Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend and Identiteaze,
but the point is that the finale of
Jet Lag: The Game is up right now on Nebula. I'm bouncing up and down.
I'm so excited. It's up right now on Nebula. Whoa! Did your stomach
just say that? I know how to do ventriloquism! Sometimes it sounds like stuff is
coming from a different... Why did you do that though?
from a different... Sometimes it's a little fun,
but you know what's especially fun? Watching the season finale
up now on Nebula. Well... do you have
a good deal for me, tall, tall man? I bet not. I do have a great deal
for you, little boy which is that you could use
the code nebula.tv/jetlag. And then, a subscription will
only cost you $36 a year. Again, that's for
the whole year, $36. That's only... $9 a quarter. So that's a very good deal.
Holy... Holy moly. I only have $36 to my name,
'cause I'm such a little boy, but I am going to spend it
all on Nebula. And I'm going to use
code JETLAG 'cause I'm such
a good little boy. Thank you, tall, tall man,
for all of this information. Bye. Why did you do that
with your stomach again? Oh my god, do you have
another arm?"

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","0zTOd9trqEo","Welcome back to episode four of our race to claim
the most countries in Europe. Right now, the score is 5-4 with Ben and Adam having
claimed Liechtenstein, locked Switzerland, and stolen Germany,
France, and Austria. Right now, they're about to board
a flight from Zurich to Rome so they can claim
Italy and Vatican City. Meanwhile, Tom and I have
claimed the Netherlands and locked Belgium,
Hungary, and Czechia, which we did right at
the end of the last episode. We then planned to make
our way towards Slovakia, which we expected to take a while,
but it turned out that the train we had been told didn't exist,
did in fact exist. So now we're headed to Bratislava ahead of schedule with
a plan to lock it quickly and make our way back
to Vienna Airport and catch a flight to Copenhagen. Sam.
Yeah? Train! It exists.
It exists. Do you think it's a mirage? This is the RegioJet.
Grab your bag. We're going to Bratislava on a train that
apparently doesn't exist. Thank you very much, Czechia. Okay, Sam.
What are the lads doing? They're at the airport. Flight AZ571 to Rome. Gate A72. Is that exactly where they are? That's where they are. Unless they're deliberately
going to the wrong gate to throw us off... Yeah, but we'll
learn pretty soon when the plane starts
taxiing, but... And as soon as
that plane starts taxiing, we book to Copenhagen. I have news, Tom.
Okay. You think it's
good news or bad news? I mean, you haven't
dropped your croissant. I'm just trying to scare you.
We're actually already in Slovenia. Or Slovakia.
What? We passed the border?
Yeah. Was that bridge the... I don't know if
that was it, but... Oh, I'll text 'em. Maybe. Wait, you have to do
a bunch of emojis and stuff. Okay, yeah. Oh, wow. Well...
Okay, well... It would seem that
they did make the train out of Breclav. They have already
claimed Slovakia. They got straight
to Bratislava. I'd say that
things are looking... not so good for us
and very good for... their chances of getting
a flight out of Vienna before the end of the day. Yeah, we have to really hope
that this Slovakia challenge trips them up hard. Oh, they are speeding up. I do not like that. I do not like that
one bit, Adam. Tom, what did you
put in the message? I put Slovenia.
And where are we? Sl— Slovakia. Mhm. I knew someone was
gonna make that mistake. I am embarrassed
that it's me. Okay. We are nearly at Bratislava. What time do we have
to be on that bus? 12:20. We've got about... 45, 50 minutes in Bratislava. We might as well
pull the challenge. Might as well pull it.
See if we can do it. But I think we need
to be on that bus no matter what.
No matter what. We have to be on a 12:20 bus.
Yep. The time now is... 11:40. 40 minutes. Some challenges have
been done in that time. Let's go. Thank you. Okay. Alright, welcome to Slovakia. Welcome to Bratislava.
Alright. Should I pull it?
Pull it. Let's hope this is good. Visit one castle per capita. Slovakia has the highest
number of castles per capita in the world. Your team must enter
(or get within 10 meters of) two castles within
an hour of reading this card. At each castle, one team member
must wear a crown (any pointy hat) and make a royal decree
on the subject of your choosing. Oh, I, I don't know, Tom. What? They're in a very
different area of town. Oh, they're in a
very different area of town. There's one just there, and then there's
a presidential palace. I guess it's technically a palace. A palace is not
necessarily a castle. I'll check the rules, but... Yeah, I'll check
the rules as well. Anything with ""Castle"" or ""Palace""
in its name counts. Okay.
We can run, right now... There. In fact, there's loads.
Let's go, there's two. Come on, lock in. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
I know. I'm just tightening
my backpack. We just have to
get within 10 metres, wear a pointy hat,
and make a royal decree. I'm pretty sure we can improvise
a pointy hat with something. Wait.
What? Check the trash can
for paper. I don't see any.
Okay, but good plan. How far is the closest? Across the road—
There! That's it. That is by Slovakian standards
and by the standards of my map, that yellow thing is a palace. Now we need...
hat materials. Yes, we do. We're gonna improvise
from our packs here, Sam. I think we need
to get up here and... Yeah, up, over this, across. The only paper I have is...
challenge materials. We can make
a very small pointy hat. That'll do. There are no restrictions
on pointy hat size. Okay. Look through the packs. We've gotta be able
to make something. I mean, I have
the challenge card from... Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Challenge card. Go, go, go, go, go. Alright, so... Which way do we wanna do this?
This way 'round. I declare that
to be a pointy hat. Is that pointy enough for you? It's pretty pointy.
I think that's a pointy hat. I hereby decree
that I will not get any flack for confusing Slovenia
and Slovakia earlier. Despite the fact that
I sent the message with a load of emphasis
and emojis. I think you're only subject to this royal decree
if you're Slovakian. That's fine by me! But that's probably the people that are
most subject to... Yep! Alright, come on!
Next castle! Oh no! It's up there? It's up there.
How far up? Top of the stairs. 12:20 for the bus, right? Lock in Tom. Lock in. No, hang on.
I don't believe this. This is not a castle.
This is stairs. This is marked as stairs. Alright, we're going
to the Pistori Palace. Next right, down here.
How far? Same distance again. See the colonnade there?
It's on the sign. Palace.
It's on the sign, Sam. With speed, please.
I need you to swap out your hat. I'm gonna do my hair. Sam – Hat. Decree. Go! I decree that... if you are the pilot of the... ITA Airways flight
from Zurich to Rome, that's in the air right now... you decide that you want to go on
a little vacation in Algeria, divert there, spend
a couple of days there, check out the beaches. Maybe strand Ben and Adam? Okay, so they just... made an announcement
on the flight... that... there's been an issue
and we are being rerouted. Where are we going? We are now going... ...to the Snack Zone, baby! Welcome to The Snack Zone. We have been served
food on this flight. It's very exciting. Today we'll be trying this... pizza raft.
Sort of a raft of pizza. The main taste I'm getting
is hot. That's it. That's claimed. We have the country.
We have the country! Sam, we have— we've got—
we've locked it! Sam...
That was pretty good. Lock it in! Come on! Okay, they're not answering. Alright, so—
'Cause they're in the air. Let's record a little message. Hey gents.
Hey. We... We've just both become
monarchs of the... Slovakia. Yeah.
Crazy how that happens. Locked— Country locked. Enjoy Rome? Bye!
Bye! Come on, let's get that bus! That is the Vienna run
all locked up, and we got three of them. Slower than we wanted,
but we've locked three of them. That was pretty good.
That was pretty good. Alright. Welcome to Rome. ""Bienvenue al Italia."" Buongiorno and all the others. That means that is Italy claimed. I think ""bienvenue""
probably actually wasn't Italian at all, was it? Oh, okay, well,
but you could still say it here. Yeah, there's no law
against saying it here. We got a text from them
that they locked Slovakia which I would say is
pretty bad news. So this is sort of quite bad and that they would definitely
be able to fly out... at the end of today... probably... to Copenhagen. Yeah. You think just
go ahead and book? Yeah. I just got a text, I imagine. Yeah. Well... At least we made the right plan. We made the right plan. Let's hope we get to the airport. That does make it 6-5. We'll do what we can.
Mhm. We're still playing catch-up. Look at the guards. Can I see it? It's terrible.
It's a terrible shot. Uh-huh. But you might have been
able to briefly see a castle in it. And I believe that was
Adam's end location in Tag 3.
Yep. Oh, we got city walls
over this side. It's very pretty. It's not the greatest
bus tour in the world, but I feel like we've seen
a bit more of Bratislava now. It's a lot cheaper than most... Yeah.
...tourist buses. Alright. I'm a fan. I'm satisfied. There we go.
There's the big... There's... Is there
an Adam there? Ahh, no. This is the river Danube.
Oh, really? So long, Slovakia.
We are back in Austria. We need to get
to the Vatican. Yep. We took a look
at all of the flights and there's just nothing
that's makeable today. So I think that today
we just have to focus on locking both of these countries. We'll go back to the airport. We'll finish our day at the airport,
and we'll take a flight first thing in the morning
out of here. I think that's all we can do. But look, we're up and we're
about to get another country. Yeah, yeah. Alright, we gotta find
the bus to the Vatican. Back at the airport. Back at the airport. (sighs loudly) Okay.
Okay. Well...
Let's go check in. Yep. I got no idea...
How to get across. How to get
across the damn street. Oh, underpass.
Oh, great. ♫ (hums faux-Italian melody) (scatting) Alright, alright, alright.
Here we go. Ben... This is the Vatican.
This is the border? This is it.
Okay. Vatican City has been claimed. Now we're in the Vatican.
Woo-hoo. We are gonna try
to be kind of chill here because it is the Vatican.
You know... We aren't trying to
be disrespectful. Look, they have
a Christmas tree. Ooh. That's fun. I guess they would
like Christmas here. I guess that would make sense. Not that many people
are filming. So I think it's all good. Are you ready to get
the Vatican challenge? I'm ready for it. Okay, let's see
what we got here. Create the Creation
of Adam, Adam (or Ben or Sam or Tom). Create the
Creation of Adam, Adam (or Ben or Sam or Tom). The Vatican is home to one of
Michelangelo's most famous works: The Creation of Adam, located on the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel. You must recreate
The Creation of Adam as Michelangelo did. Your artwork must be above you
during its entire creation. It must then be correctly
identified by your audience through a Google Form. Easy, easy, easy. So it says— That's a very
recognizable painting. Um.
Um. We just need a pen
and a piece of paper. There is a souvenir store
at the tourist information office. So why don't we try to do that,
which is, I think is this way. Okay. Here we go. Yeah, pens, postcards. Oh, and in fact, we've got
the Creation of Adam pen. Okay. Yeah, let's get one of these magnets
to look at to reference. Wait, what about these? That works. No problem. Perfetto. Alright. We've got
our materials. Adam? Here's the fact of the matter. We have to do this thing,
which is kind of silly... here in the Vatican. And so, I think we just
need to try to find the spot where it's gonna be
the most chill for us to be doing something
a little silly. Would you like to draw it,
or shall I? I thought you did
a very good job on George Wormington. Thank you. Alright, I am happy to do it. Maybe over there. That feels like it wouldn't
be that sacrilegious. I think here seems just fine. I've got my reference.
Yep. Gonna lay down.
Take a little lay down. It's also really important... you should hold it up pretty high because my whole body has
to be below it at all times. Right. How's that?
It's pretty good. Bring it down. Okay, here we go. Is it looking perfect? Yeah, it looks perfect.
Great. I'm getting his muscles
and stuff really good. That is one of the
most important parts. So here's a— something to— that I would like you
to know, Ben. In my mind's eye,
Adam has a little leaf over kinda his... his peen. Yeah. Is that not the case? Nope, it's straight out. It's all... It's all hanging out. Here in Italy, they...
do things a little differently. Oh no, this pen
can't write anymore. On account of
potentially the ink. So you hold that up there.
I'm gonna get the pen working. Oh, you're doing very good. I would say this is pretty... pretty perfect. Okay, I got it.
Got it going again? Okay. Great, we're good. I wonder if the Pope
would like Jet Lag: The Game. I think... he would. There's a very aggressive
seagull here that is attacking
all the other birds. I mean, I really...
I actually, at this point... I don't want to
overcomplicate things. So I'm just gonna
sort of, just put a little... little bit of texture.
Mhm, yeah. Some shading, wow. You are the modern day
Michelangelo. Alright.
10 more seconds of work. Okay.
You're free to stop whenever. Okay, I'm done.
I think I'm done. Okay, well...
Camera, there you have it. This is Adam's
Creation of Adam. I don't think there's any
room for interpretation here. No, that's
The Creation of Adam. I think that's... If you put this on the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel, no one would notice. Right, no one could
even tell the difference. Okay. I'm just setting up
a Google Form now. And then we run it
for 15 minutes. We do have to remain vigilant. Did you know that this country has
the highest crime rate in the world? So I say we spend
the next 10 minutes seeing if we can find the Pope. Yep, I bet
he's here somewhere. There's only a few guys
who live here, and the Pope is one of 'em.
Yep. You'd think we'd be
able to track him down. Not up there. Do you see him? Nothing. Nothing? You'd think he'd
come out to greet us for visiting his house. Maybe he's hiding
in the fountain. Well, this is his bathtub. No. I guess we wouldn't wanna show him
in the nude anyway. No. How many more
minutes on our time there? Five.
Five minutes. Okay, you guys better
be good at art. Okay, 15 minutes have passed. Here, let's go stand
in front of the beautiful... Benjamin, the time has come to see if our audience
knows about culture. Yep. We got
a lot of responses. Or if they're
a bunch of jokers. How many responses total? We currently have
1,204 responses. Now, Google Forms
summarizes the responses to what the
most popular ones are. Okay, let's see. And so when I click
over to this tab here, the audience can see it first. Is it— Is it— Yeah, we're good. I wanna know what the top non-Creation of Adam
responses— Mona Lisa got 10. (chuckles)
Mona Lisa got 10. Yeah.
Okay. Alright, well that was
no problem at all. And now it's time to call We have locked the Vatican!
...Sam and also Tom as well. Green lights. Oh. Hello. Greetings from the Vatican.
Greetings. Now, a lot of people
think that... the Pope is in charge
of Vatican City. Not so.
Not so. What they don't realize
is that in fact, we are in charge of
Vatican City in the sense that we have
now locked Vatican City. That means... Catholicism is on our side. That's true.
So good luck dealing with that. Yeah.
Folks. Um, so...
where are you going? Is it, uh... Copenhagen or is it
somewhere else? Somewhere else. What'd you do in the Vatican City? Oh, do we have our art? Sam, what piece of art is that?
What's this? (chuckles) Is that a Banksy? Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Alright.
Congrats. Alright, well...
Bye. I hope that your plane explodes. Before you're on it.
Not when you're on it. I hope no one's on it. I hope no one's on the plane. How would no one be
on the plane at all? I hope no one's on it,
but then it explodes, so then they can't go
where they're going. Okay.
Yeah, I agree with that. Bye. (sighs) Well... we did good work here. Alright Ben, we need
to go back into Italy... and then we need to
pull the Italy challenge and then we need to
do it fast enough that we can end the day
at the airport so that we can take
an early flight probably to Amsterdam, but we will confirm exactly what we're gonna do later out.
We'll figure it out. I'm gonna take this home
and tape it to my ceiling. Okay. Here we go. Are you ready to go
back to Italy? ♪ I'm goin' there ♪ Aaaand Italy. Welcome back to Italy. I've got our Italy
challenge right here. We can open it
when we are ready. Okay, well... Welcome back to Italy. We're back in Italy, baby. Now, it is time to lock Italy,
which we need to do before we go
to the airport tonight. Are you ready?
I'm ready. Here is our challenge
for Italy. Limbo in limbo. Limbo in limbo. The Italian writer, Dante,
is best known for Inferno: a book detailing his fictionalized
journey through hell. In Inferno, the first circle of hell
is known as ""limbo,"" which is where you're
headed for this challenge. First you must get underground (ie. fully below street level,
out of view of the sun). Then you must limbo:
Roll two dice. One of the values will be the height in feet that
you must limbo under, and the other will be
how many attempts one of your team members
has to limbo under it. That is terrifying. If it's too... Ugh! I mean, I don't think
we could limbo anything under certainly three feet. Could we even limbo
under three feet? Could you limbo
under three feet? I don't know that I could
limbo under three feet. Well, you're shorter than me.
Well, let's see. You know,
how do you limbo good? I don't know. Like that? I don't know
how high that was. No. Okay, well, I guess
let's roll our stupid dice. Oh, we have to get underground. Yeah, let's just go
back to the tunnel. Look, here's one thing. We get two numbers and one of them is just
number of attempts, right? Right.
That is a lot less important. No, obviously... whatever the higher number is
will be the height. As long as we get one
that's a four or higher, I think we're fine. When we were walking
from the Vatican, we walked into a tunnel
under a bridge. Right. So, we figure... that's our limbo. I'm just really scared. There's a decent chance that
this is completely impossible. No, if we roll
two numbers under four, I think we are... uhh... in trouble. God. All this effort to get to Italy and this is what it's
gonna come down to. Oh god. So Tom, I think it's
worth discussing what we do when we get to Copenhagen. Yeah, 'cause we spent a lot
of time researching just then. I'm of the belief
that if we can, we should get on a train
to Malmö tonight. Yes.
Because... Then we could do...
Malmö challenge... come back to the airport. Yeah, I mean, it leaves us
the maximum flexibility with already have claimed Sweden.
Yes. We get back to 7-7.
Yeah, we do. And then if, for some reason,
we would decide we wanna get some flight that requires us
going directly to the airport in the morning, we can.
Yep. Okay.
Alright. Let's get to Malmö if we can. 'Bout a 90 minute flight?
We'll be there. Let's hope that we
push back quickly. Uh-huh. And if we're luck— And let's just hope
that the lads, you know, screw up the Italy challenge. Okay, folks. We have made it back
to the tunnel where we are underground. We are in limbo, as it were. So now it's time to roll our dice. In a very real sense, these dice rolls will determine
the fate of Italy. Okay, we're gonna say
roll a die. We need... Four, five or six. Here we go. Here we go. You wanna use my phone? Yeah, maybe you have
better service. (sighs) Oh my god.
Yeah, okay. Okay, are you ready?
Yep. Oh, there it goes. Ohhh! There we go, baby.
Okay, that's a five. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine.
Let's see... Let's roll another one. Three.
Three. We get three attempts
to go under five feet. That should not be
any problem at all. I think we can do that. Oh, thank god. Wow. It says that this is five,
which seems approximately right. Just do not touch my arm. Wonderful stuff. And that is Italy locked. Let's call them. Okay. My guess is that
they are on a plane. Yep. A plane to Copenhagen. Boys, are you on— Can we look sad this time?
Look sad. Boys, are you on
a plane to Copenhagen? They're not gonna pick up. No, look, actually
like as be believable. That's how I look when I'm sad. That's a very quick call. That was quick. Hello!
It was quick. It was quick. We... Do you wanna know
why it was quick? We have locked Italy. It's 'cause we're so
good at Jet Lag: The Game! Because we're really
good at Jet Lag: The Game and we've locked Italy. Oh, they hung up. Well, they were so angry
they hung up. Okay.
They're on the plane almost certainly to Copenhagen. Which is not awesome news for us, especially considering
that we have now quite a bit of dead time here
at the end of the day. There goes the
steal Italy and Vatican plan. It wasn't a plan. It was a hope. It was a hope, yeah. Here's the upside. They have two and a half hours I don't think they can
do anything useful of. Oh no, they get
two and a half hours in a very beautiful
part of the world where the weather's usually good. Yeah, but they
can't do anything useful. That's true. Okay. Well, Ben, the two challenges
that we had the most time for were the ones that took
the least amount of time. Yes. Because now
we have, what? We have about three hours. We've got three
basically totally dead hours. Which is never good. No, 'cause we just
want to go to the airport. 'Cause we want to take a flight.
Let's look. Let's look at what flights
we wanna take out tomorrow morning. And in the meantime... we're going somewhere fun.
Yeah. Okay. What the hell is this thing? This is just like,
you go to a place in Europe, and you're like,
""What is that? What is that?"" And they're like,
it's the public library. But what is that? The Altare della Patria,
I think. I don't even know what that is.
Never heard of that. But look at that!
Never heard of that. Never heard of that
(bleep) before. You want a
Saure Glühwürmchen? Damn, those are just good. I know it. Oh my god. They're carrying
something very important. It's the trophy. Yeah. (laughs)
That's the Jet Lag trophy. That's the trophy. They're transporting it to
our end location right now. That's crazy. Crazy stuff down there. It's crazy to be
where ancient Rome was. And it's like, I wonder
if they ever thought about how Jet Lag: The Game
would be played here. Right. It's like they probably
thought about that. Do you think that
they were ever like, ""I wish we were
in the Snack Zone""? Well, probably a lot. I think a lot of them starved. Hello. Buongiorno to... the Colosseum. Look, here's what I wanna say. Gladiator and Gladiator II. Think about how much
money they spent to do like a big CGI build whatever, the Colosseum,
get it in their movie. We got a Colosseum in our show. Paid— Did for free. Jet Lag—
Got it for free for us. Yep, Jet Lag: The Game. Well actually,
I guess they had to build it a long time ago. But they did that for
Jet Lag: The Game. Right. It probably cost
a lot of money though. Okay, Ben. I think it's decision time. 'Cause I would like to
go ahead and book a flight. Yes, I would say we have two main routes, right? We've got the safe route.
Yeah. Yeah. Where we go somewhere
like Spain or Portugal. Yeah, we get two.
Get an easy two. An easy open two. Or...
Or... We've got the riskier route, which is that we go
to Amsterdam and we try to steal it, and then we try to catch a flight out of Amsterdam
to somewhere else. That... would also
probably get us two. But it would net us three because it would take
one away from them. But it has the possibility for us to only get one
if we fail. And we know that the
Netherlands challenge is hard because it's the only one
that's been failed That's true.
...all season. Not everything. I have only
the Orange Gerbaras. Uh-huh. Christmas Rose is Finnish.
Ahh. Alstroemeria,
I don't have that. Okay.
Not now, and not anymore. And Mimosas,
not from this time. Alright. We have been given
a duff challenge I think. Here's the thing.
Yep. If we can't get
Christmas Rose... Yep— They can't
get Christmas Rose. (laughs ecstatically) Ben, Adam. If you somehow come
to the Netherlands and you are able to find plants
that are not in season from an actual florist...
Yeah. Honestly, they kinda
deserve that at that point. Well, the one thing that
I almost sort of like about this is that they don't know
why this is failable. Yes. Yeah, they don't.
Until they do. So they might be coaxed
to come to the Netherlands with something that—
It sounds like it's not impossible. Some flower shops might
still have Christmas Rose. Yeah. But it's a—
It's for Christmas. Yeah.
And it's now not Christmas. Ohh! But I just think
that we're so good at Jet Lag: The Game.
That's what I think. I think...
I think it's Netherlands. I'm gonna book the flight. And that also means if Sam and Tom mess up
any of these challenges... Denmark or Sweden... We are gonna be right
next to those countries. We're gonna be
right on top of them and then we'll just
go snatch those up. So they have gotta be
on top of the ball. Conformed. Alright, that's that then. We're going to Amsterdam and we are going to
be trying to liberate the great nation of the Netherlands
from Tom and Sam tomorrow. Well, they have
a very tyrannical grip on the nation of the Netherlands
They do. and it needs to be liberated.
It's so messed up! It's so messed up! Ben, let's go to the airport. We have to end the day there
because our flight is at 8:25, 55 minutes after
the game day starts. And so we need to be
in front of the security area ...when we end the day
so that we can start exactly there. Alright, off to the airport. That's the thing on the left. That's Denmark. I'll text them. 7-6.
7-6. Well, unless there's some
surprise waiting for us, that's 7-6. If you want to tie the game back up,
even if it's not locked... 5:02 you said the train to Malmö gets us all the way there? And the 5:08...
will get us into Sweden into a decent enough station. We're not gonna try
challenges tonight, but if we can get the 5:02 or 5:08,
we'll tie the game up. That's currently 4:47,
so... get ready to jump out. Okay, well... looks like they just
touched down in Copenhagen. So they got Denmark. Not locked. They have not locked it.
And they may never lock it. That's certainly
what we can hope for. Again, it's like we're going
first thing tomorrow to Amsterdam. We'll be right by there. If they mess up this
challenge tomorrow... (whoosh)
(clap) Pyeew. We go get 'em. Come on. Let's go, go, go, go.
4:59. Are we at the furthest pier?
Maybe. Three minutes at most. Track one. No, hang on. Track one there. That was an interesting move. Yeah, it was. Make sure our ticket's
valid, Sam. I got two minutes spare. Ohh. Copenhagen Airport. Malmö. If this says not valid 'cause
it's some fancy train, I swear. Well, we have time to get
tickets for the next one if so. 16:59.
There we go. Save journey. Glad we got the Interrail pass
'cause that... just got us a ticket to Malmö.
Nice. How do you feel
like today went, Ben? They caught up. They caught up. They made up a lot of ground today. They had a very good day. So I feel like we gotta really
kick it into high gear tomorrow. You know? Yeah. I would say
that today was not... It was not our strongest showing.
No. Hey, Sam.
Yep. When do we hit Sweden? I think it's at the maritime border. 'Cause we're on—
Yeah. Or it's gonna be on that
little island in the middle? I think so. Yeah.
Yeah. That, I think... is gonna be across
the maritime border. Three, two, one. That's it.
That's Sweden. It's a tied game, Tom.
It's a tied game. It's a tied game. It doesn't feel like a tied game. Well, Ben... They have claimed Sweden... Which does make the game tied. They kinda got our ass today. Yeah, they did good. We got two today.
They got four today. I think tomorrow,
Amsterdam's the right move. I think the thing is... if we flub Amsterdam... I think we're gonna
potentially be behind. There's Denmark, Sam. That's the best shot I can
get of Denmark right now. Do you mean Sweden, Tom? That's Sweden, Sam. That's the best view I can
get of Sweden right now. You're doing great. Good luck.
Thank you. So Tom,
we have three minutes left in our game day.
Yes. It might just
be worth discussing first moves for tomorrow. I mean, there's a good play maybe
by going to Helsinki or Tallinn. There are flights in kind of,
I think there was a 1 pm and 3 pms to both. Whatever happens, we need to at least
try to lock Sweden and Denmark tomorrow.
Or— And then—
Or one of the two. One of— Yeah, okay, fair. Because keep in mind
the potential option of we lock one of the two
and get the earlier flight, it's a more aggressive move, but...
It is. We probably need to
be aggressive at this point. That's true. Either way, the clock up there
is actually running... Oh, a clock on a train station
should not run late. It is 17:29 and
20-something seconds. We got 30 seconds to strategise. What do you wanna talk about
for 30 seconds, Tom? I think I'm gonna
talk strategy with you 'cause we can't during
the rest period. What are you
gonna have for dinner? Look, Tivoli Gardens is
closed over in Copenhagen. I'm already annoyed I'm not
going on rollercoasters. I'm gonna have
Swedish meatballs. Look, we got like 15 seconds. I think we try to
lock both countries. But, who knows where
the lads are going. That might make a difference.
Yeah, we'll see. I don't know. Three, two... You wanna just double check? Alright, welcome to the airport. I'm checking to make sure
that we have both the phones. We're so scared
that we might lose And we do.
these filming phones. Okay. Welcome to the airport. Okay. Well, Ben... It's 5:30 pm. Which means
the game day has ended. Yep. I think that, you know,
we did okay today. We did okay.
They did better for sure. They had a much better day.
And you know what? We took the safe route today
and I think... Yeah, I think
it did not pay off. I think it didn't pay—
I think, tomorrow? Full send.
Yeah. Tomorrow, we try to
steal the Netherlands. If we succeed, that's huge. If we fail, I would say
that's very bad. But we're gonna see what happens. The boys are gonna
draw some blood tomorrow. See you tomorrow morning
at this exact spot. (smooches) Three, two, one. Day four, Tom. Day four. Good morning. Good morning. Should we maybe go
in the station where it's warmer and make a plan?
Yeah, yeah. Well, I think our plan, Sam, has to be...
that we lock both countries. If we— or at least we try to.
We cannot leave two undefended. We can't really
leave one undefended. I agree we
definitely can't leave two. I think there's a possibility
it might be strategically beneficial if only doing one gets us
onto a better flight. Maybe, but these are such,
such easy to get to countries. Yeah.
There are so many flights. On that note, I think I might
know what the lads are doing. I think I worked it out last night, but I now need to actually
research and check. So, we know they ended
right at Rome Airport. Yeah.
As far in as they could go. So my theory is
they're taking an early flight. And I think... I think they're trying to take the 08:25 to Amsterdam. Okay! Good morning.
Good morning. It is day four. And lemme tell you... I'm starting to get
a little bit smelly. We did not pack
so many clothes this time. Well, it is
we didn't have room 'cause we had to
bring the little bags because of the European
budget airlines. Nothing you can do about that. There is something
we can do about. Winning this freaking game. And I would say
more specifically, going to the wonderful
country of the Netherlands. Yep, and that is
what we are about to do. I sure hope they are.
I sure hope they are. 'Cause we think that challenge is – I'm not gonna say impossible – but it is basically
find flowers that are out of season. It's not an impossible
challenge, I don't think, but it's the most
difficult challenge we've had so far. It's the likeliest one
for them to fail. They haven't
failed a challenge yet. Yeah. They don't know how hard
the challenges can get. Yeah. And in fact, Benjamin... here's our gate. We've made it. We will board this plane
to Amsterdam. Literally no
freaking problem at all. Are they scared? Are they feeling good
that we're going to the Netherlands? I just don't know. I think they're terrified. They better be terrified. They should be quaking
in their freaking boots. I think they're
gonna get there, think they're gonna
try and defeat us. And here's the thing. If they do get that challenge,
it's devastating for us. Yeah.
But if they don't... I see that... to be honest, that's the way
that they like to play. In which case,
should we pull a challenge and defend Sweden? I think we better.
Alright, Sam. I think after we do this,
we need to have a real question on whether it's worth...
Yes. On what flight we want to take.
But I know that we— But it's gonna depend on
whether we get this or not. We need to lock
one of these countries. Should I pull it? Yeah, pull it.
Pull it, pull it, pull it. Oh, let's hope this is
good, Tom. The time is 7:33. Go. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Ooh boy! It looks like maybe
everybody is in trouble? It's... It's... This is a tense moment
here in Jet Lag: The Game. Big moment for
Swedes and Dutch people. Indeed. But good news for you. As you can see what happens
right now, because the next episode
is up right now on Nebula. You know, you want to know
what else is up right now on Nebula? Not only the next episode, but the Layover podcast
about the next episode, and in fact, the Layover podcast
about every episode. Because we recap
every episode of Jet Lag on the Layover podcast
exclusively on Nebula. You can't listen to that stuff
anywhere but Nebula. You could do a fun game
where you spoil the next episode for yourself
by listening to The Layover. You could listen to The Layover before you watch the episode.
That could be interesting. That would— Don't do that. I don't think you should do it. I think it'd be a fun game. What else can you do
with a Nebula subscription? That's a great question. There's all sorts of Originals by talented creators. There's been a good number
of really ambitious, exciting fiction projects
from the past year and more to come. For example, you can watch
Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend, you can watch Identiteaze,
both great. Or if you go real back
into the archives, you could watch
Patrick Willems' Christmas special. We're in that.
We're in that. We're in that. Or his Night of the Coconut.
Night of the Coconut. One of the greatest cinematic
achievements of all time. He's making a new one that...
the cast has been announced. Yeah, it's in post-production. Yeah.
It's been shot and everything. It's coming out in
a couple months, I think. Really excited for that. TLDR... ...is on Nebula. That is true. TLDR is on Nebula as a Nebula...
(wheezes profusely) There's a TLDR News show
on Nebula. That is true. Too long; didn't read... There's a lot of good
original content on Nebula. I think when you add,
as a Jet Lag viewer, if you add together
the fact that you can get all of the Jet Lag stuff
that we mentioned, plus all these Originals,
plus you're actually helping support us
and helping fund the show? It's a pretty good deal. But Sam, it costs too much money! What if I could offer you 40% off an annual subscription? Then it would cost
the right amount of money. Yeah. Well, Ben, I think you should... fire up your old internet browser and go to
www.nebula.tv/jetlag. And press the enter button. Woah! I got 40% off. And that means that
it's only $36 a year? $36 a year. That's only $9 a quarter. Wow.
Wow. Or— Or— I can't do that math. How many is that a day? It's like free a day. It's like 10 cents a day. If you round to the closest dollar,
it's $0 a day. Yeah. It's like how Tic Tacs
don't have any calories. Exactly. Nebula is free. We can't say that.
Not actually. Wait, are you saying that
Tic Tacs do have calories? Yes.
Yeah. Of course.
They just round them down, yeah. They get rounded down
with the sugar and stuff. Are you having full meals of Tic Tacs?
Uh-oh. That's not good. Ugh, okay, sorry. Maybe that's why you keep
having cavities. No, it's him. I'm the one with the cavities.
It's him. Which is why I abolish the dentist!
'Cause he doesn't believe in the dentist. Because I abolish the dentist
on Abolish Everything!, exclusive to Nebula. Whole 'nother show
that we haven't talked about. But anyway, go to
nebula.tv/jetlag. Sign up. I gotta call my doctor. Okay.

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","dsDy5VAw-xo","Hello and welcome back
to episode three of our six-day race to claim
the most European countries. Right now we're in
the middle of day two, and Ben and Adam have just
managed to flip the lead. Tom and I started
today well ahead with France, Belgium,
and the Netherlands, while Ben and Adam had
only managed to lock down Switzerland and Germany
on day one. But early this morning, they stole France
out from under us by completing a challenge
in Saint-Louis and then raced us to Austria. We managed to get there first,
claiming the country and briefly tying the score. But Ben and Adam arrived
only minutes later, and after a
nerve-wracking challenge, stole the country before
we had time to lock it. Yes! Ohh!
Let's call them. Let's call them. That means
the score is now 4-2, and we're about to get the call
with the bad news. Nnngh. Oh, I'm getting a call.
Oh no. This is gonna be it.
Oh no. Okay, right. (sighs) Well, it could go
one of two ways. It could go one of
two ways. Here we go. Gentlemen... They're happy. They look happy. Gentlemen, we played
a wonderful song. A beautiful song. And we've done it
perfectly flawlessly. And we've stolen
the country of Austria. Austria is now ours.
Alright. You had it for
just a second there. What'd you play? We gave it to you
for a little hour. Alright, yeah,
no, fair play. We were looking
for twangy rulers, and we did not find them. It's 4-2, and... Rulers.
Rulers! We got a train to catch. Okay, good bye. Get on your train. Good luck. Alright.
(smooches) (growls triumphantly) Let's (bleep)-in' goooo. And Adam, would it make you
feel any better to know... that the great country
of Austria, which we now own... does export
38.6 million kilograms of wheat per annum? I feel amazing
knowing that. Ugh. Let's go.
Where are we going next? I don't know. Train? Oh, don't you dare
get sad about that! You were all, ""I'm not
gonna let them depress us."" You were all— I'm not gonna let
them know that we did. Okay, now... We are off.
I am so (bleep)-in' hyped up! To St Margrethen,
right across the thing, back into Switzerland,
and then we're gonna go down... Yeah, grab Liechtenstein. And we're gonna
go cross another bridge into Liechtenstein. Another country, not bad. We should potentially...
go do the Switzerland challenge. I think the smart move is to
try to lock Switzerland now, so that we know if we even need
to try to lock Liechtenstein. Okay. First things first. Let's get rid of
all of this wine. Alright. Back to Switzerland,
shall we? We stole two countries
from them today. Good bye, Höchst. Alright.
Alright. We have great timing
for a train to... ...Hungary.
Okay, let's go. Let's— Let's get back
to that station. Yep, this way. That's two countries
stolen from us. Yeah, again... And we've—
And one challenge failed. It's not awesome.
Have they failed— They haven't failed
a challenge yet. No, I mean, they're
always good at challenges. Yeah. Alright, lead the way,
lead the way, lead the way. Quick update, Sam.
Yes. The lads have moved
back to Switzerland. Okay.
They've crossed the border. Surely they'll,
at this point, lock Switzerland, right?
I mean maybe they'll— You would assume
you'd lock Switzerland. I guess you'd wanna
go to Liechtenstein. You'd go to
Liechtenstein, yeah. And then you'd
lock Switzerland once you're back in Zurich, because then you'll
have better stuff there. Sam, we are in trouble. No, we're not.
Why are we in trouble? J chillin, Tom. Well, we're
back in Switzerland. That to me... was some of the best
(bleep) we've ever done. Here's what I think.
I think we should go ahead and just try to lock
Switzerland now. Because I think if we
lock Switzerland... there's no point in
locking Liechtenstein. Because if we lock Switzerland, and we have locked Austria now, then you could go steal
Liechtenstein from us. But it would be
a huge waste of time. Yeah. Because it's
not easy to get to. We... should at least... finally... Yeah, finally, geez. see what our
Switzerland challenge is. Over a day later. Here we go. Déjà vu. Déjà vu. Shot for shot,
and word for word, recreate any
at least 90 second scene from any previous
season of Jet Lag, in the place where
it was filmed. The scene must include
at least one person and at least
30 seconds of dialogue. You may rehearse your scene
as much as you want, but you must film it in
one, word-perfect take. Here's what I will say. I definitely think
we can do that, but we can't do it here. We can do it in Zurich. That's so annoying. But... Here's what I think
we should do. Let's go through Liechtenstein,
claim it, and then let's go
where we can do this. Because, well, just as
a rules clarification, you can't have two challenges
active at the same time. Which means that
we can't even see the Liechtenstein challenge.
No. But we can pretty
much guarantee... We can 100% do this.
that we can do this. 'Cause we can do this
at Zurich Hauptbahnhof. We can do this at
Zurich Airport. Let's go and let's
head towards Liechtenstein. We're gonna claim it, then we're gonna
lock Switzerland, and then we're gonna
figure out what we do next. It's the RegioJet
to Budapest. RegioJet, nice. Have you been
to Vienna before? Yes, a long time ago. Some point I should actually go
and stop at the Prater and... But, we must move on.
Man. Tickets. When we get to Hungary,
we've got maybe three hours left in the game day, right? Yeah, about that.
Okay. What train do we
want to get outta there and where do we want to go?
'Cause we can come back. But that doesn't
seem to make sense when we could... No, we want to
go to Bratislava next. We could hopefully
get Bratislava, and Bratislava has
way better connections. How long 'til we hit the border? I don't know. Adam, did you know that
Waagen von Coop und Migros stellen dir eine Zusatzfrage? I actually did know that.
Okay, that's good. I just wanted to double check. We are almost to Buchs. Then... Liechtenstein will be ours. Sam, I'm having
a bit of a panic 'cause I just checked the route out of
the place we're going... Mhm.
To Bratislava. And there's only one train there and it gets us back after
the rest period starts? Well, there's a lot of trains
back towards Vienna. Yeah, but there's— There are no connections
out to Bratislava. Sam, this is not good. This is— There's no
connections out of there. Well, I mean—
How did we not check this? The thing that we...
could do is... just, there's super
frequent connections back to Vienna. And then from Vienna, there's pretty frequent
trains to Bratislava. So... Yeah, but we're still not
gonna get there tonight. No, not necessarily, no. We can't get to
Bratislava tonight. There just isn't—
There just— There just isn't a train. We could walk. Speaking of which,
what are the lads doing? Let's focus up
on Liechtenstein. Welcome to Buchs. Welcome to Buchs.
We're still in Switzerland. But we're very close to the wonderful country
of Liechtenstein. Indeed. Let's get over
this border, shall we? Let's cross
yet another border. What time is
our train outta here? We might have to hurry
a little bit actually. 2:40. Oh. We might not make our train. Uhh... Let's get this bus.
Okay. This bus?
Maybe. No. Schaan, Schaan. This bus.
That bus is to Schaan. We're on the bus
to Liechtenstein. We thought we were gonna
walk over the border, but it turned out it was gonna take
longer than we thought. I'm excited to go
to Liechtenstein. It's like... I don't know if it's
coming across on camera, but it's kind of
crazy beautiful here. It's true. Ooh. Man. Yeah. I mean, look at that. Ben, once we cross this river... Ben, welcome to Liechtenstein. Yaaay. That puts
the score at 5-2. Fun fact about
Liechtenstein... is that it does not seem
to export any wheat. This is our stop. Okay, well, we are
here in Liechtenstein. Welcome to
Liechtenstein, buddy. It's great. Liechtenstein claimed. 5-2. I think the thing
at this point, Tom, is going to be... how do we set ourselves up
for the earliest arrival into Bratislava
tomorrow morning? Yeah, and the answer
is probably back to Vienna. So I saw a train there.
Which one do we have to be on? So we can take a 4:32, which leaves us plenty of time.
And that— Well yes. And that means we're back
in Vienna Central at 5:20. It's not worth getting on
another one from there. And there's a 7:45
from Vienna Central to Bratislava tomorrow.
Alright. It's the best plan we've got. I think so.
I'll keep researching, but... Oh, Ben is showing
as far, far, far south and moving south, to me. Oh, well Adam is...
showing live. Ben is—
Ben is showing live. Oh.
Oh, no, Ben— Yeah, Ben's phone is
still moving south. I'm worried he
might have dropped it. Ben is— Ben's
phone is moved— Oh! Oh no. Uhm.
Well, quick update. Ben left his phone on the train. I lost my phone. But I'm gonna get another phone
and then we'll be fine. This is... This is... It was... will not be a setback. What do you think
about Liechtenstein, Ben? I think it's very
shockingly picturesque. I think it's cool
how little wheat they export. That's something I know. I think it is very cool
that they're... run by a corrupt prince who— here's something fun. The Prince of Liechtenstein,
he spends all of his money on UFO research. I think that's pretty cool.
Yeah. And I think that's that
on Liechtenstein. There's a bus
in three minutes. Great. So we cannot attempt
the challenge here because our Switzerland
challenge is still active. And we do very much
want to complete that. Yeah, that one
we need to lock. Score's 5-2 right now. You gotta feel
pretty good about that. You gotta feel
pretty good about that one. We're gonna take the bus
back from Liechtenstein, and we can get
a train to Zurich. And in Zurich, we can go ahead,
and lock up... You lock up Switzerland,
and then it's a big question what we do next. We'll talk about it later. There's a lot of options. It's kind of confusing.
Yeah. Alright, well,
good bye, Liechtenstein. You are vulnerable. You are so very vulnerable. But I do not think
that Sam and Tom will steal you from us. How are you feeling, Tom? Oh, I get what
you're going for. Hungary. Why? We've just
crossed the border. Claimed. Wasn't 'cause
you didn't have lunch? Claimed, claimed,
claimed, claimed, claimed. Let me text 'em. Hungary... claimed. Should I mention the score? I can give you
a snack if you want. 5-3. Alright, Ben,
we've got three minutes to get on our train. We-ow. I think I see platform one. Platform one. Alright, well... We're going
to make our train. But...
(sighs) They have claimed Hungary. They did Hungary first,
which is sort of interesting. They got there fast,
and Hungary is sort of... It's the hardest one.
Quite difficult to get to. So that would imply to me
that they've done a good job of optimizing their route. But who knows?
Maybe they'll get stuck. You can get stuck
in Hungary. Alright.
We made it. Your tickets. Oh shoot, I—
Now I don't have my... He left his phone
on the last train. His phone is lost. Thank you.
Bye. Thank you. Oh man.
We got a little bit of rain. This is a random ass rain.
And... ...very little else. We have two hours in the middle of
nowhere in Hungary to try and do a challenge. And that's... That's the best we're gonna get. Bye, RegioJet. Always, always a little, little,
just a tiny bit intimidating to get off at a
middle of nowhere station. Oh yeah.
In a foreign country. (laughs)
And see the train... Yep.
...go away. But I'm sure we'll be fine. There's a little cover over there.
Maybe we wanna go under. Yeah, alright. Okay. Send it. We gotta hope this
doesn't require a big city. Do 96 things.
(chuckles) Do 96 things. The number 96 pops up
a lot in Hungary: The principality of Hungary
was established in 896, buildings in Budapest can't
be taller than 96 feet, and it takes 96 seconds to sing
the national anthem at tempo. Your team must
collectively do X burpees, drink Y half-ounces of wine, and complete Z multiplication
problems by hand, such that X plus Y plus Z
equals 96. You must do your 96 things
in 15 minutes. Teammates cannot do the same things
at the same time. Here's the thing,
I can do a lot of burpees. Do either of us
want to drink wine? We get one
for each half-ounce. I think we should
at least get a wine bottle in case things are going poorly.
Yeah, alright. (laughs) So I don't drink. Yeah.
So... (laughs)
And I can't do the pushups, but I can do multiplication
problems, Sam. That's something I'm good at. Well, I suck at multiplication. Excellent, teamwork.
Let's go get some wine. Well... Ben... I think your phone
might be donezo. Yeah, I think so. Okay. Welcome to Sargans. Now we just transfer
on the train to Zurich. Get yourself the lowest ABV
that looks like it tastes good. We need a nice
Hungarian wine. I found a lovely Merlot. I have found
some sort of local baked item and I'm gonna have that. I realised they had convenience store
reheated food there, but this appears to be some
local Hungarian bread product that our editors will look up
and put the name on later. And it's still warm!
It's just come out the oven. We got wine. Thanks for the yoghurt as well.
Let's go do this. Okay, rules are: You may not practice
burpees or math. Your burpees must
include a pushup. Your chest must
touch the ground. Right, 15 minute—
Need me to set a timer? 15 minute time. Wait, it needs to be
multiplication specifically. Oh god, this is by hand? These are way harder than I thought they
were going to be. You ready?
I can get a lot of burpees. Okay. You count in your head.
I'll count in mine. 15 minutes starts ...now! 100. 1-9-0-0... 1-9-0-0... 1-9-1-8... Guh! We have to start
planning our next move. We have to decide what
we are going to do tomorrow. As I currently see it,
we have... four different options. Tonight we start
traveling towards Milan. Then in the morning,
we finish our journey to Milan. We claim Italy... and then we fly out
of Milan Airport. Option two:
We do all that stuff. But instead of flying
out of Milan Airport, we continue from Milan to Rome,
where Vatican City is. Claim the Vatican.
Claim the Vatican. We end the day at Rome. Fly outta Rome.
Fly outta Rome in the morning. Other option: We fly out of Zurich
directly to Rome, which we can do. And then there are
two more flights that we were looking at. We were looking
at an early flight to Amsterdam.
Yeah. And a slightly later
flight to Copenhagen. So the flight to Amsterdam... is great 'cause
it's really early. It's super expensive. That would be like $1,000
total, which I hate. That's tough,
and the thing is... I know that we haven't been
spending that much money now, but in the later days
of the game, we're gonna need—
The flights— Yeah, we're gonna
have to fly a lot. I don't know. 8-6-2-4-9-4. I'm not certain about that.
It's a minus. No. Do it again. Do it again.
Do it again. Do it again. Five. Wait, it said by hand! It didn't say in your head.
It said by hand! Sam, I'm using your notes app. Are we all done?
I don't know. 10 minutes remaining.
How are you doing? I'm outpacing math, so... Okay, cool. How are you on numbers?
I'm only on 11. I'm on 39, so...
Okay, gimme a sec. You sure?
Yeah, it's fine. I suck at math and
I'm good at burpees. Okay, well... (grunts loudly) You gotta squat. Oh, I've gotta
squat as well? Yeah.
Oh, I physically— Never mind, we'll carry on.
I forgot how to squat. There we go! 75.
What are you on? 75.
75. So our total is 90, 91? 76. I wanna do the wine as
like the last couple. Yeah, that's fair. In the next three minutes
and 59 seconds. Let's go get that train. How much is
that many ounces? Honestly, that was... One, one more gulp for... Easily.
Sam, challenge completed. Let's give 'em a call.
Let's give 'em a call. Let's give 'em a call. Oh, and they're calling us. I wonder if they've
locked Hungary, or if they've
absolutely biffed it. We've locked Hungary!
They look happy. Hungary is locked! (sputters)
(cackles) Wait, what did you do? 96 burpees
96 things. slash multiplication tables
Oh, you did that one. Oh my god.
slash half wine ounces. Sam hard carried that.
Was it close? I managed like 15
multiplication problems. He did 80 burpees
in 12 minutes. Wow. I don't understand
this challenge, but it sounds... 96 is apparently an
important number in here. Okay. And so you had to... Was it close? Was it tight? We're going.
We're catching a train. Bye. Crisp! Haah!
I'm— That's a good thing to
end our strategy day on, right? I was feeling bad about this.
Yeah. That's a high—
Let's go get that train. Hungary, you have been lovely. It's been a very brief visit, but, whatever pastry this is,
it's really nice. The wine was good, honestly.
And you are— And you get delightful music
for your train announcements. Well, they locked Hungary.
I don't really care. But good for them. I guess. That means that... they'll have gotten
one country today. No, they lost two. Oh, France. Yeah.
Right. Their net for the day is zero.
 Their net for the day is zero. Wait, their net
for the day is... They have three. They started
yesterday with three, and now they have three.
Now they have three. Sure.
It's hard to believe. But they have made
no progress today. I forgot that we
stole France this morning. Yep. Yes, we did. Sam, I am in a good mood.
That's good. I realise we're still behind... but... We locked the country
like we wanted to. We haven't got as far
as we wanted, you know, and we knew
we were gonna get between two and four countries.
Yeah. We got two,
and then we lost one. It's not what we wanted. This one I think
was always gonna be the trickiest of the three. Yeah. And tomorrow... Tomorrow we should
be able to sail through Bratislava and Czech Republic
and then get maybe an afternoon flight
or something, Yeah.
if we're lucky. Now an update
from the lads. Their tracker puts them
on the route back to Zurich. Well, Ben's tracker or
Adam's tracker? (snickers) Well, welcome
back to Zurich. We still have not decided
what our next move is, but regardless,
we've gotta do this challenge and lock Switzerland. And we gotta do it right.
We gotta do it right. We really cannot mess this up. If we leave
Switzerland open, we're in big, big,
big, big trouble. Huge trouble.
Because... Especially 'cause
Liechtenstein is not locked. We did film... at Zurich Station.
We did. In season nine
of Jet Lag: The Game. Yep.
A very, very wordy scene. I wish that we
hadn't said so many words. One other thing we could do is we could split
the remaining territory down the middle
by asking if he's near the same international airport. 'Cause there's one in Zurich, and there's one in
St Gallen, here. And we could find out
if he's here or here, but... (croaks) So we should see
if there is a less wordy... Yeah.
...option. Or if maybe we want
to go somewhere else. Let's take a look
at the footage. Yeah. And see which scene
we wanna recreate. Let's just try
to get somewhere warm. Yeah, it's cold. Okay, Tom. I've looked into
our options tomorrow. Mhm? There are pluses and
minuses to both directions. Okay. But I think it actually
might make more sense to head to... the Czech Republic first.
Okay. We can take
an 8:20— 8:10 am to Breclav, which is
the border station. Yep.
From there... we can spare... it's not bad, it's an hour 15.
Mhm. Can get an hour 15
for challenges. Okay.
But we have to take the 10:20 to Bratislava. Right. It'll get us into Bratislava
at 11:26 am. And I— And we can
get 55 minutes, if... we don't take the train
to the airport, but there seems to be
a direct bus, and we get to the airport
at 1:10. Which gives us flight options to both Copenhagen...
Yeah. And to... And to Rome without
cutting it too close. So I think in our minds, we need to make a flight at the end of the day.
Alright. But we're actually arriving
in two minutes. We are arriving into Vienna. Made up a lot of time.
We did. So actually,
I need to pack my bag. Alright. Yeah, I think... we need to make a flight
at the end of the day. Yep. And that's more important
than locking countries, I think. Particularly if
there's only one country left unlocked there.
Yeah. One country
is not tempting. Okay, okay, so... A little update. It does seem like
the Zug[zuhg] segment is gonna actually be
a lot easier to memorize. It has the fewest words.
Yeah. Okay.
The road pattern of... Merlischachen kind of fits. But... it's not close enough
to feel like a slam dunk. And also if we go to Zug, and we're able to complete this
by the end of tonight, we can get on
a train first thing... Towards Milan.
Towards Milan. Go down to Rome,
do the whole Rome train plan. Yeah, there's actually a
7:30 am exactly train from Zug. I think that this is probably
the safest thing to do. Because the truth is I started getting
extremely scared that we will fail
this challenge. I don't know if you saw
when we tried to memorize the Ōkaihau Express... It did not go great. ♪ She... starts out from Otiria ♪
♪ She... starts out from Otiria ♪ ♪ The smallest train you'll see ♪
♪ The smallest train you've seen ♪ Nope. You've already got it wrong.
What? ♪ Driving— ♪
♪ This is— ♪ No, it's driving!
(bleep) ♪ When they're dripping
from the sack ♪*\ No! (bleep) Ohh, this is a
(bleep)-ing nightmare! Mm-kay, we're gonna
study on the train. Off to Zug. All you Zug-heads out there
are gonna go crazy over this. They're going south. They're going south? Yeah.
High-speed to Italy? Maybe? Although I'm not sure that's
the right route for that. Why would they go
all the way to Zurich and then south? (distant whistle)
Oh, Sam. (brakes squeal) ♫ (train plays C major scale) ♫ (sustained near-D note) So... That is the train to Kyiv. We could have
used the train to Kyiv as an instrument. Joking aside, does put it all a bit
in perspective, doesn't it? We're getting to do
all this travel, all these countries... and that's heading
to a country at war. Doesn't even have... Those are Ukrainian carriages. That's cool. Alright. What are they doing? Yeah, I think...
they're on the route that would take them to... Lugano and stuff, which is interesting.
Doing the... It's not the route I'd take. Although the one
interesting thing, Tom, is... they still haven't
claimed Switzerland. They still haven't
claimed Switzerland. Oof. Okay. Welcome to a place
that I know very well. And I don't know at all. We're in Zug.[zuhg]
We're in Zug.|zuhg And we're going to
perform a scene for you. We didn't really have any
footage on that train ride, because we were both— We were
memorizing our lines. We were in our—
the sort of memorization zone. Okay. We can do as many
runthroughs as we like. But then we got the one
that's gotta count. We get the one. This bench? Right? Yeah?
Yep, this is it. I've really gotta embrace my inner Sam.
Mm-kay. Would you like to do
a readthrough on book or off book? Let's just see what we've got. Okay. I think I've probably,
in the intervening minutes, lost some.
Okay. Alright, are you ready?
Mhm. The road pattern of...
Merlischachen kind of fits. But... it's not close enough to
feel like a slam dunk. Okay. The road pattern of
Merlischachen kind of fits. But... it's not close enough to... to... No, see, this is
one of those ones. – to feel like a slam dunk. No... I think this does match.
No, I think this does match. Look, this thing.
Look, this thing. That totally matches that. That matches that. I mean you can clearly... mm.
I mean you can clearly... mm. It's pretty close. That is pretty close. Nope. ""It's pretty close."" It's pretty close. – confirm it for us
before we go there. And look,
how about you do that? This just confirmed it for me. – that can confirm it for us
before we go there. And look,
why don't you do that? ""How about you do that?"" Oh, god. Now that I think
about orientation, yeah, that is pretty clear. Now that I think
about orientation, yeah, that is pretty clever. Nope. ""That is pretty clear."" No. That is pretty clear. I'd been memorizing
that as ""clever"". Okay, it seems like we have
about 10 minutes until the next train option there. Okay, well, seems— Mm-mm. Okay, seems like we have
about 10 minutes. Okay, seems like we have
about 10 minutes until the next
train option there. Okay, I'm gonna—
You need to review all of this. Bleh. I don't think we're
gonna do it tonight. We have 10 minutes. I mean, how badly do
we wanna take that train? Not that badly. Not that badly. We'll do it in the morning. We're going to have
forgotten all it by the morning. Well, we'll re-memorize it,
or we could do it now. Do you think you—
Here's what I'll tell you. I will get it right now. Yeah, what?
Gimme a percentage. 95%. 95%? That's pretty good. I'd say like 70% chance
I get it all right. I'm giving you 70%. No.
No? You're much more confident than me.
Let's try it. Let's try it. Let's try it. But as practice?
As practice. Okay. Okay. The road pattern of
Merlischachen kind of fits. But... it doesn't feel like— Nope, already wrong. (cackles deeply) Alright, well. Ugh. We'll see you tomorrow morning. (smooches) So when you said
70% chance you get it. (stammers)
Seven— this is like— Have you heard of
Nate Silver before, Adam? Alright, well,
that's game day end. (laughs) That coulda
gone better. We're gonna
have to pick it up if we're gonna catch up.
Yeah. We're gonna have to hope
for some fumbles by them. I think they're setting up
for tomorrow that... I'm not sure they'll get three.
I think they can get two. I'm not sure they can get two
and get somewhere useful. Yeah. So that might be the thing
that helps us catch up a bit. Sam, they have
surprised us twice. Yeah. I have no doubt that
they'll surprise us again. But it doesn't matter tonight
because we know we've got a plan
for the morning. We can decide which flight
we take tomorrow, and beyond that? First thing tomorrow? Czech Republic. Czech Republic. See you there.
See you tomorrow. Good morning.
Day three. What's the plan, Sam? I think... head to
the Czech Republic. Yep. So we do Czechia, then Slovakia, hopefully do
a challenge in both. 'Cause we do not wanna
leave two countries next to each other undefended. Yeah, but I think
I'll feel good as long as we lock one.
Yeah, same. But what I
don't wanna do is miss a flight this evening. Yes, and we don't know
what flight that's gonna be until we know where
the lads are going. Yeah, I mean... Speaking of which... So they ended— I was hoping they
were gonna cut there. Good morning.
Good morning from Zug.[zuhg] Actually we learned... We learned that
it's not pronounced anywhere close to 'zuhg'. We have gotta get this memorized and executed on. Yeah. So I think the key is here
we just take our time. Yep.
We nail it. We're in no rush. And then we figure out
what the next step is. We have several good options. Yep. I think we should
take a look at our lines. Refresh our memories. Yeah. Trying to memorize
all of this Sam dialogue has really messed me up. I had a dream last night
that I was Sam. That's not good. No, it was frightening. So they ended in Zug[zuhg]. Yep.
Which... is on the route towards Italy. But why are they
not locking Switzerland? Why did they not
lock Liechtenstein? If they leave both
of those undefended, that is painting a giant target.
Yeah. They give us two points
and take two away from them. Lemme check our trains.
Alright. Oh wow. There was a line... There was a word that
I had kind of forgotten. Oh goodness, okay.
In my head. You see that's the
difficult thing is if you accidentally memorize it
wrong, then it can get stuck. I've got mine. Do you wanna just
try running it? Okay. The road pattern of
Merlischachen kind of fits. But... it's not close enough to feel like a slam dunk. Look... this thing. That totally matches that. Now that I think
about orientation, yeah... That is pretty clear. Okay. Seems like we have
about ten minutes until the next
train option there. That was perfect. Oh, I just feel like
we've gotta get it perfect so many times. I think we
should get it perfect five times in a row.
Yeah. Okay, ready? Okay. Got it. Well, that explains why
we couldn't do this. Alright, thank you.
Thank you. Alright, yeah, this is—
That's not ideal. Well, the train
that we wanted to take from Breclav to Bratislava... it shows up on the schedules, but apparently it's
not actually running. To be clear, we were able
to put that on our planner. Google Map says it's going.
Interrail says it's going. And then we talked to
the clerk in the office. Which, this
has happened before. This is—
Yeah. Alright, so no.
Emergency planning. Do we flip to the other trains? No, 'cause we've
missed that direction. The thing that we might
just need to do now is... Panic? I mean, there's a 10:55
that gets us in at 12:02. 10:55.
The downside of that is it'll only leave us
18 minutes in Bratislava. So we would not really be
able to do the challenge. We could probably make
the airport train at 12— or the airport bus at 12:20. It'd be a little tight
in case of delays. Right.
But... I don't see that we
have another option, but... No, I don't think so. That means we've already
not locked one country. Yeah. I still think this
direction makes sense. Yes, it does. And that's right. It just... sucks! Well, I mean— Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Okay, so... In—
Sam, take— we got— Oh yeah. Big window. Very nice.
Big window. Yeah, so I'm looking
into the schedules of how to get from Bratislava
to the airport. Yeah. And the tl;dr is that... if we don't make
that 12:20 bus... Mhm. ...we're toast. And we just have to... The thing that would screw us – as a moment of
potential foreshadowing – Yeah. – is the train from
Breclav to Bratislava getting delayed even a bit. Because we will have to
make an 18 minute connection Yeah. at Bratislava Central Station. Is the bus leaving from
Bratislava Central Station? Yes.
Okay. Okay. Seems like— No. Seems like we have— Nope, no, you had it. ""Seems like we have –"" Seems like we have
about 10 minutes until the next train option there. It's like a perfectly
normal sentence, but there's something
about it for whatever reason. Yeah. Let's just run it again.
Let's just keep running it. I mean, look,
I think we've got this. Yeah, but let's not even— But if we just like
1,000% this. You know what I mean?
Yep. The road pattern of
Merlischachen kind of fits, but it's not close enough
to feel like a slam dunk. Great.
How are you feeling? We're— I feel good. If we wanted to do it... we could do it
and make the 8 am train. Here's my opinion. I think the flight to Rome
is better than the 8 am train. The 8 am train is free, but... the flight would get
us in early enough that we could really
confidently knock out Italy and the Vatican.
Yeah. Without having
to worry about time. Let's book the flight. Oh, by the way,
Ben got his phone back. Oh, we have
a story to tell you. We were like, ""Tom and Sam,
Ben lost his phone, but they— but you guys
have a tracker on it."" So they were watching and
seeing where it went and they were like,
""Well, it seems like it stopped in this town called St. Gallen."" And my friend Sarah from home, not from here...
Who has appeared. Who has appeared in season four.
In Jet Lag: The Game. Yeah, actually has a—
real heads know. She was in Switzerland,
and Adam remembered that she had texted me
earlier that day mentioning that she was
gonna be in St. Gallen. And so Adam was like, ""You should call her and see
if she's still in St Gallen."" And she was, and she went
to the train station, and they had my phone. And then was able
to bring it to me, and then we all got fondue. It was awesome.
It's true. We got some really
awesome fondue. Ben, we're booked. Fabulous. Let's keep running it.
Let's just keep doing it. Okay. Ooh.
Oh look, big river. This might be the Danube. I'm pretty sure
that is the Danube. They're still in Zug[zuuhg], so I wonder if they're
doing their challenge there. If they lock Switzerland, we lose a really big
strategic option there. 'Cause stealing Switzerland and Liechtenstein
is, honestly... It's a path we really need to get back on the level.
It's attractive. But that's why I think
that they must— It must be worth it
for them to attempt it. Surely. So I think
our only hope is that... They fail it.
They fail it. Yeah, actually, yeah. It's a perfect fit. Oh, (bleep)!
It's a perfect match. It's a perfect match. See, that's one of those ones. It's like match versus fit. Easy to mix 'em up.
Sorry. It's a perfect match.
Perfect match. This is the train.
This is the platform. I mean, this isn't— there's
an 8:32 on this platform. What's— When's the next train? 8:59. It gets in at 9:44 ...for a 10:50 flight. Yeah, it's close,
but I think we'll be fine 'cause we have tickets. I don't know. At a certain point though,
we do just have to do it. I know, I know. But the thing is as we get
closer to doing it, I get... Yeah. I think let's do it
one more time and then let's just go for it.
Okay. Ready?
Yeah. Okay. The road pattern of
Merlischachen kind of fits. But, it's not close enough to
feel like a total slam dunk. No, no, no. No.
No, not total. No. No.
Okay. I got distracted. I got distracted. (both crack up) What's happening? Shh, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Oh my god.
Okay, just let me breathe. Let me breathe. Okay, I've got it. Take it from the top. Okay. I don't like the speed
this train is going, Sam. We have been
stuck in a tunnel and going no faster than this
for quite a while now. We have... more than 90 minutes
in Breclav, so... More than
90 minutes right now. Yeah. We have margin for
error, I think. Do we have a margin
for more bad luck? Always. Seems like we have
about ten minutes until the next
train option there. Do you want to go for it? Can we run it one more time?
Yep. Seems like we have
about ten minutes until the next
train option there. Let's just run it. Let's do it.
Okay. Okay. This is the one. Here we go. Okay.
The road pattern of... Merlischachen kind of fits. But... it's not close enough
to feel like a slam dunk. Okay. The road pattern of
Merlischachen kind of fits. But it's not close enough
to feel like a slam dunk. Okay, but one second. Küssnacht am Rigi doesn't rhyme. ""Merli-shanen"" does. Okay, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait... wait...! Okay, but one second. Küssnacht am Rigi doesn't rhyme. ""Merli-shanen"" does. Okay, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait. I assume you're looking
at this thing here.
I assume you're looking
at this thing here. Wait.
Wait. No. I think this does match.
No, I think this does match. Look, this thing.
Look, this thing. That totally matches that.
That totally matches that. Look at the bottom part.
Look at the bottom part. Look at these next to each other.
Look at these next to each other. What is this place called?
What is this place called? Melis, whatever.
Melis, whatever. ""Merlis-chanen.""
""Merlis-chanen."" I mean, we would need some— To go all the way out there,
we would need something ...much more conclusive. No, this is the—
I think this is it. I really think this is it. Wait, wait, I'm gonna trace it. Mm-kay. I mean, we would need some— To go all the way out there,
we would need something much more conclusive. No, this is the—
I think this is it. I really think this is it. Wait, wait, I'm gonna trace it. Mm-kay. That's gotta be it.
That's gotta be it. Mmm.
Mmmmnnh... Come on.
Come on! I mean, you can clearly... mm.
I mean, you can clearly... mm. It's pretty close.
It's pretty close. That's it.
That's it! Okay, well, let's figure out whether or not there is
something in that town that can confirm it for us
before we go there. And look,
how about you do that? This just confirmed it for me. Okay, well, let's figure out whether or not there is
something in that town that can confirm it for us
before we go there. And look,
how about you do that? This just confirmed it for me. I guess I hadn't thought
about orientation yet. Orientation fits really well.
Look at that. It's exact. Yeah, actually, yeah. It's a perfect match. Now that I think
about orientation, yeah, that is pretty clear. I guess I hadn't thought
about orientation yet. Orientation fits really well. Look at that. It's exact. Yeah, actually, yeah. It's a perfect match. Now that I think
about orientation, yeah. That is pretty clear. Okay, seems like we have
about ten minutes until the next train option there. Okay. Seems like we have
about ten minutes until the next
train option there. I think that was it.
That was it. That was it. That was it.
We got it. (groans exhaustedly) There we go.
Hooh, we got it! Okay. We just finished watching
back the footage, and we did—
we got every word. We got every word exactly right. You're shaking. I know, I know. Well, I'm cold too. Lots of reasons to be shaking. Hello.
Gentlemen, after a long... some might say
too long amount of time... we have locked Switzerland. At long last. We had to recreate
a scene from Jet Lag, a 90-second scene,
word perfect. Which is why
we are here in... Zug[zoog]. And so I had to do
all your lines, Sammy. You are a damn yapper. Sorry, Ben. Alright, bye.
Good. Bye! So they gave us
some additional... non-critical info there. The reason they're in Zug is not because they're
going to Italy. The reason they're in Zug
is to recreate... Oh, in the original location
from a previous season. They still could be
going to Italy. But it just means that... we thought that
the reason they were in Zug, because it's on
the line to Italy. But, they were there to recreate our time in the Zug zone. We've done it. We took so long
that actually now... that flight to Rome
that we were like, it leaves so (bleep)-ing
late in the day. We have infinite time.
This blows. Actually... Now we're gonna
be cutting it close. We're cutting it close now. Let's go to the airport. We're off to the flughafen. ♪ Doo-do-do do-do-do ♪
Woo! ♪ B'da-da-da-da da ♪ Okay, Adam,
I have a question. I'd love to answer
your question, Ben. Where are Tom and Sam? Uhm... losing. Let's look. They're somewhere...
where they're losing this game. That's true.
They're in the losing zone. I have to keep
reminding myself that I'm travelling
through Europe on a panorama car
on a beautiful morning ...playing a game. Come on, I'm stressed. Jet Lag isn't a game, Tom. It's life. But that does mean that
we are currently losing at life 5-3, Sam.
Well, yes, that's true. If you lose at Jet Lag,
you're a loser. They are nearly...
in the Czech Republic. Assumed to be...
Are they going to Breclav? Yeah, basically
on the train to Breclav. I would assume. After that, they'll make
their way down to Bratislava, I would assume. I think the real
question is just... Yeah, can they
get a flight out? Are they gonna leave,
yeah, to— Because if they can leave today,
they could get three countries. Yeah, the real question is, will they be able to
knock these things out fast enough that
they get a flight? My current opinion is... ...unlikely. So... This train is currently
nine minutes late. It's fine.
It's okay. That gets us in at 9:13. Our train out is at 10:55. That's so much time. If it's something like
their challenge in Switzerland... Yeah.
Then... If it's a time waster challenge,
we're in serious trouble. But if it's not a
time waster challenge, if it's on a time limit, then that's a
challenge we can fail. Yeah. Have we reached another country?
Three, two, one. That's the border.
This is Czechia. Text 'em, claim the point. I don't know
how to spell Czechia. Yep. Claimed. I have something to say. I have to— I have a statement.
I'm gonna issue a statement. If Sam and Tom fail to lock... the Czech Republic and Slovakia... they're in big, big,
big trouble. We will take them
from them. Yeah, 'cause those are
pretty easy to do. Boop boop. So these challenges are
gonna matter a lot for them. Good luck, Sam and Tom. I'm looking up how
to pronounce this place. I think the main
feature of Jet Lag is us butchering
small town names all around the world. Alright. Hey Tom?
Yeah? Czech this out. (scoffs)
We're in the Czech Republic. Hey, let me have my bit.
Okay, so... That train
was 17 minutes late. We have one hour and 31 minutes
before we gotta get on a train outta here to Bratislava.
Ages, Tom! When I'm watching Jet Lag,
I'm always looking at the teams in moments like this and going,
""Why are you not running? Why are you not sprinting?
Why are you not—"" 'Cause we've got ages of time. No, it's because
we've got six days of this and there's only so
much stress we can take. Ages of time! Alright. There's shops. There's an automated
parking bike tower. You ready? Sure. One hour, 28 minutes. Kill time, then tell time. Kill time, then tell time. Czechia is home to the oldest continuously working
clock in the world: the one on the
Old Town Hall in Prague. Your task now is to do three of five time-killers
of your choice from the list below,
then guess what time it is. You may not look at any clocks, and you may not look
at the elapsed time on your filming phone. To complete the challenge,
your guess must be within five minutes
of the true time. Your options for
time killers are: get an item completely wet,
and watch it completely dry; unpack and repack
every item in your bags 10 times each;
name 100 different real women; do 200 jumping jacks each; or play ten successful
rounds of twenty questions. The obvious ones there
seem to be 100 different real women,
200 jumping jacks, 10 successful rounds
of 20 questions. I don't know, I think
we could, with the right item, we could watch it dry
pretty quickly. And simultaneously
doing the other two. Yeah, 'cause we can
get to something plastic. Something plastic would
dry pretty quickly. Yeah, okay. So we can look at the time now and then we just have
to keep track of time. There's a clock.
There's a clock. We can't register the time
on any clocks. Yeah, so we need to
go somewhere that we can't. So let's find a good spot
to do all of this. Alright. Hang on, hang on, hang on.
I've got my lip balm. That's gonna dry. That'll dry instantly. We can dunk that in
just a water bottle. So how about
let's go to this park? Yeah. I mean, there's
two strategies really. It's either one of us focuses on telling time...
Yeah. And tries to get
the most accurate thing. Yeah. The other strategy
is we both do it and average them out, because, you know.
Yeah. Did it say anything
about practicing telling time? No. Well, I know in
previous seasons, Adam just kept walking and was able to
tell time that way. Do we just wanna keep
walking at a pace, figure out steps per minute,
same as he did way back? I mean, I guess it worked. It worked very, very well. But that's probably
best done by one of us. Yes.
I'm happy to... I'm happy to
walk at a pace. You're happy
to walk in pace? Yeah, I'm happy
to walk in pace. Okay, and then I'll
work on the other stuff? Yeah. Time how many steps
I do in a minute. Alright, you ready?
So we're... Time, one minute. I'll keep metronomic
pace with my steps. I don't know if I'm
as good as Adam at it, but I think it's the only way. So we're
allowed to practice because we're not
starting yet, right? Yeah.
Okay. Gimme one minute,
starting... three, two, one, now. Four, three, two,
one, done. 125. Every 125 steps,
gonna mark off one minute. The time is 09:38. And 15 seconds. Do we want to start at
the next full minute? No, I wanna start at 30 'cause that gives us
the most time either way. I guess that's true.
Five minutes either way. Okay, then we
have nine seconds. So 09:38. Seven, six, five, Remember 09:38.
four, three, two, one. Go. Alright. So I am submerging
our object. Ah! Okay. It's a little moist. Alright, Tom. Handoff. (muttering)
Seven, eight, nine, 70. One, two, three,
four, five, six. Alright... Women. Michelle Obama. Sasha Obama. Malia Obama. Eight, nine, 100,
one, two, three, four, five, six. I forget what the
mama Obama's name is. Oprah, Ellen. Amy from
Jet Lag: The Game. Michelle Khare from
Jet Lag: The Game. Toby Hendy from
Jet Lag: The Game. Uhm... Uhm... Tom, are there more
than eight women? Okay. Welcome to the flughafen.
Adam, we're at the flughafen. I love being
here at the flughafen. Let's just hope
security's not that bad. We're gonna be fine! Oh dude, not even a problem. It looks not that bad.
What is this, a joke? What is Venus Williams'
sister's name? Serena!
Serena. Serena Williams. 25... 26. Uhm... 26. Sam, you need to
pick up the pace on this. I'm not good at this, Tom! Well, can you
keep this pace then? Yeah.
One tick, tick. Ready, start.
Seven minutes. Two, three, four, five... Anneka Rice. Angela Merkel. I already did Angela Merkel. Annie Rauwerda,
Angela Rippon, Emma Bunton,
Victoria Beckham. And... Uhh... You're right, this is hard. Okay, well... We made it through,
no problem. Pretty good.
Look. Everybody,
especially Sam and Tom, they always like to talk about, ""Oh, security can be so
bad at the airports, oh!"" Well, you know
what else it can be? You know, it can be easy.
Easy as hell. Nothing.
And so... Guess what? What? You can go—
you can go— you— I don't know what
I was gonna say. Okay. Eight minutes.
What on Earth? Your brain goes empty. You're right, this is hard. Okay, Sam, I'm gonna
tag you— tag out. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. —4, 25.
67 women. How many minutes?
14. 67 women. Oh, you're clearly much
better at this than me. 68. My mom. Her name is Pamela. 69. My grandma. Her name is Donna. Tom, I'm so bad at this. Okay, trade off with me. How many do I have to get? 200! Women?
Yeah! I didn't realize it was 200. 200! We're not
gonna get to that! Well, we don't
have another option other than 200
jumping jacks each. We should do that. You need to keep walking
while I do my 200, and you need to
keep waving this. Yeah, I'm keeping walking.
Sorry, I'm getting distracted. Look at this.
I've never seen one like this. It's like a travelator, but... Down.
It's got a slope. It's kind of intense, actually. This is wild. They're doing crazy
stuff out here. Is this an airport
or a damn rollercoaster? I mean, I feel like I am
having the time of my life. Done!
Three, four, five... Tell me when
you're on a minute. I'll start counting.
How many minutes? 24. One, two.
This is dry. People who tell you that you have to get to
the airport really early? It's a hoax. It's a hoax, folks. It's a hoax, folks. That's a good
little catchphrase. Yeah, I know. I think it would be
a really charming way of starting a conspiracy theory. Right, that's
what I was thinking. We're about to board
this flight to Rome. You gotta wonder... What are Sam and Tom up to?
What they're up to. So they're in Breclav
as expected. They're in like a... They're in like a park,
it looks like. It looks like they're
doing a challenge, so... It's just gonna depend on how long the challenge takes
them, I suppose, but... Let's hope
that the challenge takes them a really long time,
and then they fail it. That sounded really mean
coming out of my mouth. No, I think that's right. But that's what
I want to happen. Yeah.
And I'm a good person. There's a train in six minutes. Then there's a train at 11. And then there's
not another train as far as I can tell until 1.
Okay. So they really need
to make that train at 11, is my opinion on the matter. Hurry up, Sam and Tom. Or, don't, 'cause again...
Don't hurry up. As previously established,
Go slow, go slow. I would like you to take
a long time and then fail. Nine... 100. Done. Okay. I prefer you say this
'cause I'm finding myself very easily distracted,
but I have an object. Okay? No, I can't count
and do 20 questions at the same time,
Sam, I can't. I don't know where I am. I think 20 questions
are our best bet. I have thoughts
on how to do this. The first one's gonna be hard. The next after that's
gonna be easier. It's got an object, right?
Yep. Okay. 30. Dude, I— Sam, I can't,
I can't keep count and do this at the same time.
Ten! Seven, eight.
Name some women. We're on about
30 minutes. Go! Let me do this.
Go, go go, I'll name women. We're on 88.
I think we need to do 20 questions. We're on 88. (bleep)
Tom, trust me. This will be easier
in the long run. Okay, okay, fine.
20 questions, 51. Well if, if you
can count, can I ask? Sure. Okay, we need 10 rounds. Is it in this park?
No. Is it larger
than a breadbox? No. Is it something
we've used today? No. Is it something you
encounter in everyday life? Not necessarily, no.
31, you were on minute 30? Yeah.
Is it something we can see? No.
Here now? No, no. Is it something we have
made a reference to recently? Not that I
can remember, no. Is it edible?
Mmmmnnh... Not normally. Is it tied to
a certain country? No.
Does it have wheels? No. Is it associated
with the time of the year? No. Sam, this is slower
than naming women. Trust me, Tom.
Does it start with an A? No. With a B?
No. C?
Yes. Second letter, A?
Yes. Third letter, B?
No. L?
No. M?
No. M?
No. R?
No. Is it a car?
No. Is it a cardigan?
No. I'm outta questions. It was a
two of hearts card. (exhales loudly) Okay! Yep, next round. Is it the three of hearts?
Yes. Lock it in.
Is it the four of hearts? Yes.
Lock it in. Five of hearts?
Yes. Six of hearts.
Seven of hearts. Eight of hearts.
Nine of hearts. Ten of hearts.
Jack of hearts. Yes.
One more. Queen of hearts. I think we're done.
Okay. How many minutes
are we on? It was really hard
to keep track. Yes, it was. I think we're around 35. I will go for 36.
Okay. Because I think we'll
have lost one somewhere. It was 38. That means that
the time must be zero... 14 minutes past the hour.
You sure? Lock it in? Let's say we lost one
and go for 15. 15 minutes past the hour.
So 10:15? And we get five minutes
on either end. Yes.
Should I check? Yeah, check it. 10:15, bring it in! Oh!
Call them. Call them. Call them.
Call them. Call them. Call them. Get in! Excellent metronomics. Excellent cards and sleuthing. Oh my god.
(groans loudly) Oh, they're calling us. Well, they're gonna
take that train. Fail, fail, fail, fail,
fail, fail, fail, fail. Look, Adam Chase, you may have thought
you're the only one who can precisely guess down to the second,
what time it is. (wheezes)
But we just killed time. We wasted time for,
what, 30? 35 or whatever. I don't care
how many minutes it is. The point is, we got Czechia.
We locked Czechia. Good luck wherever you're going.
Okay. It's not great. It's not great for us. Hmm, the
connection's gone. Well... That's not great. That... They're moving buddy.
They're moving mighty fast. They're moving. We should take a look at
what flights they might be able to get out of Vienna today. Because if they— if there's a good,
well-timed flight... they... might be able to
snag three countries today. Four to five. It feels like we should
be winning by more. I feel like we've
been doing so good. I know. I feel like
we've been doing so good. And yet we're only up by one
and we're about to be tied. Well, but we're also
about to get one more and then one more after.
That's true. We need them to slow down. Slow down boys.
Slow down boys. Alright, let's go to Slovakia.
Alright. Let's go to Slovakia.
Let's do it. Let's get that train. Okay. I'm just checking
all the technicalities. It was fine. You could— you were
absolutely allowed to tell me it was the two of hearts
after the first round. That's in there.
Except... Except... There's actually
only 100 women. 100 women.
And I'm sure— We were on 88. I'm not sure if
there's 200 women, but I'm sure there's
at least 100. (sighs) Your mind
completely blanks, by the way. Just last couple minutes,
I've been trying to think, what if it was men?
No, it's just as difficult. You just blank without
a category to go off. Nah, it's just a picture.
You saw me running— How long do we have
'til our train? Like 30 minutes.
Oh. Do you wanna investigate
an automated bike tower? Sure? There's no earlier train
we can take, right? Not that I know of
unless there's a late train or something, but... You know what?
That's more important. Let's check. It's also worth checking
whether our actual train is on time, because...
Yeah. That could be important.
Yeah, it could. Okay, where are we going? Wait, Bratis—
but that's the one that theoretically
doesn't exist. What do you mean it
theoretically doesn't exist? The 10:20. And do you wanna go
on the platform to— Well, it's
delayed by 10 minutes, which means
it's about to arrive, and it's direct to Bratislava. But that's
the one that has— you have to get
seat reservations. Is that— That's RegioJet.
Let's ask. Hello. Is English okay? English, yes.
Yeah. We have Interrail passes. Is it possible to get
a seat reservation on the 10:20 to Bratislava?
The late one? (bleep) me. There is a perfect flight from Vienna to
Copenhagen, isn't there? There is one at 3:05,
and it gets in at 4:50. (vocal fries) Is it really expensive? No, it's really cheap. That sucks. And that's what
their plan is, isn't it? You find
anything interesting? Adam, are you in
the right head space to receive information that could be
potentially damaging to your mental health? Oh, no. No, I'm— I would say I'm not. Then I have
nothing to report. Okay. Is there a flight to Copenhagen? Platform three. Not this one. Sam, this train... We were told
this train doesn't exist. Yeah. I mean— Not only were we told
this train doesn't exist, but if we had not checked... It should have left. It should have left
five minutes ago, but it's ten minutes late. Yeah, I mean... Who knows whether it exists
until it shows up, but... I know, well,
we just got sold a seat reservation on it. We just got sold
a seat reservation. It'd be weird for
there to be a delay on a train that doesn't exist.
Right? Look, don't celebrate yet
until the train shows up. No, no, I won't.
But if we get this... we have a few minutes
in Bratislava, right? Yeah. Sorry, I'm really
suddenly enthusiastic. Have you noticed?
(wheezes) No.
It might be the sudden realisation
that we might get a train, or it might be
the 200 jumping jacks. Wait, I'm just texting Adam to let him know that
we also guessed it down to the second. Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, absolutely. I just want him to know.
Yeah. Sam is texting us to clarify how good they did
at that challenge. He's clearly very excited. Who even freaking cares? We are unfazed
because we are about to have the papacy under our control, and then we will
have God smite them. If they're gonna get to
Bratislava, what... Are they
already on their way? I think probably, yes.
They probably made the train. Oh, come on. Please tell me
they're still there. Sam.
Yeah? Train! It exists.
It exists. Do you think it's a mirage? This is the RegioJet.
Grab your bag. We're going to Bratislava on a train that
apparently doesn't exist. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Hello. We've escaped
our white void. And why?
I will tell you in a second. But first, I have to tell you
that the next episode of Jet Lag is up
right now on Nebula, but more importantly,
dot dot dot, Adam? Abolish Everything!
is a new show that we are producing
that is exclusive to Nebula. It's not on YouTube at all except for some clips. We're on the set of it right now and we would like
to tell you about it. It is a comedy debate show where comedians argue
why some pet peeve that they have should be
abolished from society forever. I was on the show recently, and I argued that we should
abolish the dentist. And then once you have made
your presentation, then the Political Establishment,
who sits here, this is a panel of improvisers. We – boo – we hate
the Political Establishment. They would like for everything
to stay the same. They argue for the status quo.
So they will argue then with the comedian,
they'll grill them with questions, trying to suggest that
we should not abolish whatever it is that the comedian
would like to abolish. And then at the end,
the audience chooses the winner, who returns for the
world championship season finale. And yeah, that's the show. It's a very wholesome,
family-friendly show. It's not wholesome or
family friendly. I wouldn't show it
to small children. But... But if you're a... bigger than a large child... I would check it out
to be earnest. To be earnest for a moment. We have been working
quite hard on it. We've been here since
this morning. We're going to be here all night. And we've been working on
every episode. I mean, Sam and Adam
spent like an hour just sanding down this sign so that it would look... Yeah, it looked...
It was too shiny before but now it looks good.
Less clean. And, you know, we've made all these messed up props
and everything. Yeah, we just think that
this show is really special, and we're really excited
to be working on it. And we really think that
if you like the... the dumb sort of stuff
we say on our show that you'll like the dumb
sort of stuff they say on this show even more. It's very funny.
Here's the thing. Here's my personal plea. Zoom in on my face. Get zoomed, get zoomed. No, no, we can do it
digitally. Don't. No, no.
Okay, zoom it out. I don't like most
comedy shows personally. Is that right? I think that that's fair to say.
I think that's true. I'm not a big comedy—
I'm not a comedy head. I don't watch stand-up. I don't do that sort of thing. This show, though?
I love it. It's funny. It's like I watched this
five, six, seven times just in the editing process. And each time,
I'm laughing again. which is crazy... to... still laugh at the same joke
seven times. It's true. That's to say,
whether or not you identify as
a big comedy head or not, I think you'll like it.

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","lSwkoIQLFLo","Welcome to episode two of our race to claim
the most countries in Europe. Last episode, Tom and I
took the Eurostar route, claiming France, Belgium,
and the Netherlands. Though we only
successfully completed the challenge to lock Belgium,
leaving France and the Netherlands vulnerable to a steal. Meanwhile, we thought
Ben and Adam would fly to Vienna to claim this group of four, but they surprised us by
flying to Zurich, Switzerland and beating us to Germany
by only a few minutes. Now they're on their way to France,
hoping to steal it from us. We weren't too worried about that
because we had a great plan to fly to Vienna in the morning. But our train at Cologne Airport
was canceled, so we had to scramble
and go back to Brussels where there's a later,
more expensive flight. If we can even make
it there in time. Back the way we came, then? I suppose. I just—
I need to research whether there is a connection. What if there isn't? (sputters) Cool! Cool, cool, cool. No, it's recommending
that we go via Aachen, which is not possible.
It should— Look at that route.
That's the most efficient route to Brussels Airport. I don't know why. 'Cause earlier
it seemed to show me... I'm sure there's—
Now, there's a route, yeah. Yeah, there's a 4:31
to Brussels Central. Alright. (sighs) I need a shot of your face and the train everything,
just like, ""You got Deutsche Bahn'd!"" It's really impressive
considering... we didn't even go into Germany. We still got Deutsche Bahn'd.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm not saying we're going slowly... but we are about to be
overtaken by a bicycle. Yeah, it's tough. (wheezes softly) They're still not
going to Basel, but... Why not? Are they having
train problems as well? Certainly possible.
I mean, they're in Germany. Adam, Ben, I'm not certain, but maybe you just got
Deutsche Bahn'd. Maybe you just got
Deutsche Bahn'd. Hey Ben. Deutsche Bahn canceled our train. This is shocking. This is a shocking
development to me. You know, a huge strat
in this game should be to avoid
Germany entirely. Now the good news
is that there is supposedly another train
in 15 minutes. So it should...
theoretically be fine. We heard a large explosion,
and then they just took our— They just made the train
disappear off the board. So I wouldn't say
that it's a good sign. Okay, so if they're
going to Basel... there is Basel Mulhouse
Freiburg Airport, I think it's called, the...
Mhm. But that one. And is there a Vienna flight
outta that tomorrow? The 10:10 Austrian to Vienna. What time does it arrive?
11:40. What time would our flight
arrive from Brussels? (snickers)
We would get in at 11:35. (laughs)
Five minutes earlier! But it doesn't—
It's not the schedule. It's wheels down time.
It's wheels down time. It came. Gonna be late, but it came. Whew. Well, I do think we're gonna
be able to steal France. Well, if we succeed. I think that we are gonna be able
to give it the old college try. Alright, Sam,
we are nearly back in Liège. What are the lads doing? They're... on
the line west to Basel as I thought they'd be.
Alright. I'm not convinced that's
a good strategy for them? I mean, they're not in any sort of advantageous
position to us, as far as we can tell. Of course they have the chance
to pick up France. Which, that's significant. Yeah. Oh, I wanna steal France. It would be— Imagine, imagine that
they take the Eurostar, and we end up with
France and Germany on the first day. Ridiculous.
Ridiculous. It's unheard of. And it's like,
they just left that open. Yeah. 'Cause the thing
about a steal, as of course you know, because you the audience
are very smart... A steal is a two-point swing. It takes a point away from them,
and it adds a point to us. So it's functionally worth the same
as getting two countries. Yep. It's 3-2 now, but it could be 3-2
the other way. Yeah. But if we blow it, then... they'll have won the day. I don't see that happening. Smile at the window. So good. There's a departure board.
I think that's a bus schedule. That's the departure board. Mulhouse, track 33. Look how French it is. There he is. (whispers)
He's asking you to be quiet. I hate him. (whispers) We hate him.
But we have to be quiet. He's asking, he's saying
we have to be quiet. Shhhh. Are they doing
something weird, Tom? Or why are you looking like that? There is a train to Saint-Louis[sahn-loo-ee]
in three minutes for them. Mhm.
From platform 33? Lot of platforms. In theory,
they could get that... and try and get France tonight.
But they'll have to get a move on. Here we go, Ben. Finally leaving...
Off to France. Leaving five minutes late. Thank you, SNCF. So they're going back to...
They're going back to Brussels. Yes, which is
very surprising to us. We're trying to figure out why. Yeah. We thought they should've
gone down to Luxembourg. 'Cause they
could get Luxembourg, but like they're like... maybe there's a really good flight
out of Brussels in the morning, but we can't find anything. No, I mean it seems
like the best flight out of Brussels is to Vienna. But we would beat them to Austria
tomorrow morning. And there's an okay flight
to Copenhagen, but it's not a slam dunk. You're also just gonna
be wasting time in Brussels. 'Cause you're in Belgium,
a country you've already locked. Yeah, they're just
sitting around in Belgium. I don't know.
I don't know, man. I don't know what they're doing. Man, this is a slow train. Yeah, it's crawling
along into France. It's alright. It's alright. And they are entering France. I really hope they
stuff up the challenge. I really, really hope they
stuff up the challenge. It'd be very, very useful for us. Alright, buddy. Well, we've made it to France. (sighs) Oh man,
I hope that this works. Yeah. Otherwise, we just
wasted so much time. Okay.
Alright, let's do it. Let's hurry up. Welcome to Saint Louis[seint loo-is]. Let's get out
in front of the station in case we gotta run
to a business or such. I'm excited to see the arch. Alright, they are in Saint-Louis[san loo-ee]. Okay. So we should expect
their challenge soon. Okay, hello.
We have made it to France. A vulnerable country. It's very vulnerable here. It is controlled by
the tyrannical Tom and Sam, but we are here to liberate it. We're gonna go ahead
and open this. Let's hope we can do this one. Open an unpopular museum. The Louvre in Paris is the most
popular museum in the world. In this challenge,
you must create the least popular. Go to any museum,
then spend 20 minutes recreating three things
that are there. Mark an area of four by four feet
and place your three objects and a sign with the name
of your museum inside. This is your new museum. In the next 10 minutes,
if any stranger spends more than five seconds
in your museum, you fail. At least five strangers must
visit and leave your museum during the 10 minutes,
or you must start over. The museum you visit may be
out of the country, but your museum
must be in France. Okay.
Okay. It seems as though there is
something called the Pocket Museum, which is open 24 hours because it's just a little window. Okay. It's actually
back in Switzerland. Okay.
We can take the tram there. We can get there
before the day is out. We'll take the next tram.
We can get there... We'll basically end the day
at the museum. The annoying thing is
we're gonna have to— we have to go into Switzerland
and we have to go back into France. Right, 'cause
we have to actually do the challenge
in the country. So, but that's fine. This is, look, it's not the
easiest challenge in the world. No, I think we can do it.
We could get screwed, but there's no time limit. We can take our time.
Yeah. And I think we can do it. This is true.
I think we can do it. I think we can make a museum that people do not give
a (bleep) about at all. Okay, well, let's go
to the Pocket Museum. Let's get on the tram. We're having so much fun
on the tram. Okay.
Okay. There's nothing more
we can do tonight other than wait for that call.
Except for— Except for pick the flight. Our options are still
Vienna or Nice. If they're taking
a flight out of Basel, they're taking this flight. And if they're taking this flight, I think we want to
take the flight. Yeah, I agree. Because we want to
fight over those countries, so that at best— And if they're not
taking that flight... we've got the...
Right. Either the best or the
second best bit on the board. Right.
With no competition, or... The— Yeah, it's the only— Book the flight. Book the flight.
Book the flight. Yeah.
Yeah. $784. (growls) That's more than I want.
But that's... It's 20%.
slightly less than a fifth of our total budget.
(sighs) Yep. And we didn't spend any today. Call it. We're going to Vienna. Tomorrow is going to be... Interesting? A fight over... What do you call that region? I mean, I can't call it
the fight over Austria-Hungary. (laughs) That's... We had a couple of those,
you know? Yeah. Let's a-go.
Okay. Ben, welcome
to the Pocket Museum. Oh, it's so cute. Look at that. In many ways,
it's one of the cutest things I've ever seen in my whole life. So he is rolling up
a little present it would seem.
Mhm. They're doing surgery.
Ah-huh. Which is dark. What's happening in this one?
Uh-oh. This one's very dark. That one's spooky. Oh no, that elf is dead. I think that this is murder. Five, four, three, two, See you tomorrow, folks.
one. Happy rest period, Tom. (exhales deeply)
We made it through day one. Well, Ben, the day has ended. Tomorrow morning,
I think we can finalize what we're gonna do here.
Okay, good night. Good night.
(smooches) Okay, now it's time
for the first rest period. Each day at 5:30 pm
Central European Time, gameplay stops so that
players can sleep, shower, and consume as many
calories as possible. Gameplay resumes from
the exact same point at 7:30 am Central European Time
the next morning. And so without further ado,
here is day two. Day two.
Good morning. We're going to Vienna.
We think they're going to Vienna. Let's get on a train.
Let's do it. Oh! Alright. Brussels Airport. Platform three. Uhh, yeah.
Here we go. Great timing. Not that we're in
much of a rush, but... True, but we might as well. Good morning.
Good morning. Everyone seems to be asleep
here in wonderful Basel. But not us.
Not us. We are awake here. We're awake, and we're
at the Hoosesagg Museum. Unfortunately, we need to pick the three most boring
things from here. That's true.
And recreate them. Make a wrapping paper? And a fork. I mean,
does this branch count? Are these branch—
These are a thing in there. They are a thing in there. There are a lot of objects
that we can recreate. Yeah. We need to figure out
where we're going to build our little museum. There's a couple of options, right?
We could go— 'cause we've gotta get back
over the French border. So we could go back to
that train station we were at. There's also the airport
right over the border. Oh, look at this. People are throwing out
their Christmas tree. So maybe we just... Perfect.
We've done it. Train station or airport? Where should we build
our museum? Let's try the train station.
Okay. 'Cause I'm not confident
about the airport. Where are Sam and Tom
this morning? Can now see why
our game day is so short. Because despite a
14 hour overnight, I can't see anything out there.
it's still pitch black. But the sun will rise soon. Hopefully. If it doesn't, we're in
big, bigger trouble than... Yeah. But at least probably equal
challenges for both teams. Eyes peeled. This kiosk is open, Ben. See if there's anything. You know what we could do?
We could take one of these. Uh-huh.
Oh, that looks like wrapping paper. And sort of recreate
the roll of wrapping paper Yeah, I like that.
the little gnomes had. Okay, let's get that. Thank you. Alright, let's go get on the tram. Where are Sam and Tom? We just have to see... Yeah.
when they go to the airport. If they go to the airport.
I am... Surely they're
going to the airport. Welcome to
Brussels Airport, Tom. Before you go up...
Yeah? Curious for your opinion. Are humans animals? What? I wanted to get
your opinion on a card. Touch an animal
that's not a pet. Humans are animals, right? Humans are animals. God damnit!
It's probably our oversight. No, it's just
a simple question. Are humans animals? I'm not getting involved. (scoffs) Seems like
a pretty simple question. And yet! Welcome back to Saint Louis. Saint Louis.
I can't wait to have some ribs. So we need one more item. Yes.
That matches the museum. And then we need to figure out
where we're gonna make our museum. I will just say right here.
Yep, right here, pretty good. There are people walking in. And I don't think
that they are stopping. They're not stopping.
Right, like this. This whole corridor.
Right, this whole corridor. Nobody would stop in here. Right, there's no reason to. There's simply no reason to. There's the mini-mart. We're gonna poke around
in the Relay. This is exactly the kind
of thing that was in there. Or actually, look at this. This is even closer to
one of those key chains. And it's tiny.
And it's tiny. If we can rip it off the pen. Yeah, we can
rip it off the pen. Love that. Perfect. Merci. Okay. We've acquired our items. I think we've done
really good work. The real key to this challenge is just picking the right spot
for the museum. I feel like
I have the perfect idea. I believe that our museum
should go in here. It's just like the little window That's true.
of our museum. The only question is,
are we at all worried that people won't walk
close enough to the wall? Maybe. Maybe... I can observe the doorways. The doorways are more narrow. People are more guaranteed
to walk through them. If we put the museum right here... Yeah, okay. I buy that. Because also nobody would
wait around in a doorway. It's very rude. This is gonna go great. Okay. The doorway's really smart. Hello, welcome to the installation
of the Pocket Pocket Museum. Our first piece is
this wrapping paper. Our second piece,
this beautiful pine needle. And our third piece
is this key chain. And finally our sign. There, that's beautiful. That's the Pocket Pocket Museum. That extends four feet. One, two, three, four, and then this line
to there, four back. It's basically if you
walk through the doorway, you've been to the museum.
Yep. Here's the deal. When we open the museum,
it will be open for 10 minutes. We have to have five people
go to the museum, which just means to walk past it. If anybody stops at the museum
for longer than five seconds... Then we lose.
Then we lose. But I don't think they will. I think we've been
very smart about this. I think that our museum is
going to be a huge failure and thus a massive success. Happy Christmas, Tom. Oh, it's the Tintin... Oh yeah.
...rocket. Sorry, I should
probably be saying more, but I've got nothing. Instead I'll just take the camera
and point it back at you. Oh yeah, I think. Okay.
Museum. Are we ready?
Yep. The museum is now open. One. She did not... She did not like
the museum very much. Oh, this woman's going. Is she rushing
to see the museum? No. Alas, she hated the museum. That is two. He's going right through. This is working just beautifully. People do not like
the museum at all. Two more guests
for our museum. Will they stop and enjoy it? Alright, that's five.
So that's— We've hit our minimum. Now we just have to wait
another nine minutes and make sure that no one
actually stops in the doorway. But why would anyone
stop in the doorway, Ben? How rude would they be?
No one would stop in the way. But if anyone stops in that doorway
in the next nine minutes for longer than five seconds, we do not steal France.
No. And these are
the kind of stakes we're dealing with out here. In Saint Louis of all places. I could see in their minds
an overarching strategy being... Sweep up behind us.
Yes. And I was thinking before on whether or not that's
a viable strategy. But I think the trickiness of it is, effectively what happened
in the Netherlands is that the fact that
we have failed a challenge means it is challenging. And therefore...
Yeah. You spend all that time
going somewhere. And maybe you still have
a greater than 50% chance. But even that, you know, one third of the time
when you fail and you spend all that budget and
time going there, that's pretty impactful.
Yeah. There's the
advantage of being first in terms of you're more likely
to end up with the country, 'cause you get, you claim
it in the first place, and then you have first
pass on the challenge. But there is the advantage
of coming in second, in which that's not
a one-point swing, that's a two-point swing. And I think it's impossible
for us to know now No.
which strategy's better. We're gonna find out. He's in there, and he's out. They're in there... and they're out. I want France so bad. I know, buddy, I know.
Seven more minutes. Seven more minutes.
Okay. You would never
stop in the doorway. You would never stop
in the doorway. No, you would never,
you would never. Hi.
Hello. No way.
How's it going? You absolutely can,
as long as you don't spend more than five seconds
in that doorway. Just we're begging you not
to spend more than five seconds in that doorway. Good to meet you. Good luck to you guys. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you. Alright, see, that was fine. But what if she had noticed us
while she was in the doorway? I know, I was gonna say. Legit, if she had done that
10 feet that way, we would've been screwed. What time are we at? We're at six minutes. I have bad news, which is that the museum
has been open— Oh my god.
No— Gotta go through.
Whoop, yep. (wheezes)
(hyperventilates) Okay, we're good,
we're good. See, that was also very scary
because they hugged. Two minutes left. Don't stand there. What if somebody stops and
looks at you or something? Okay, one minute left, Ben.
One minute left. Man, I am so nervous. I'm some of the most scared
I've ever been in my whole life. Okay, he's going through.
He's moving at a nice brisk... One, two, three, four, oh my god. I almost just threw up. That was the scariest thing that's ever happened
in my whole life. Five, four, three, two, one. We're good. Oh my god,
it got testy there. Oh my god. Okay. Yeah, clear out the
Pocket Pocket Museum. We'll go ahead and
install this somewhere else. I think up here,
it says C and D. Yeah, yeah. Let's get on this train.
Okay. Let's call Sam and Tom,
shall we? Hello gentlemen. Hello.
Hello. I am afraid to inform you that we have wrested
France from your grasp. Hmm. Yeah. We opened a museum,
and it was a huge failure. But in its failure,
it was a massive success. Congratulations.
Good bye. Good bye.
Good bye. (whispers) Oh my god. Alright, Adam, where to next? It's time to go to
the wonderful country of Austria, I think.
I think so. Alright, well,
that means it is 3-2 to them. That's the bad news. You know what I just noticed?
The good news is... Yeah, you were looking
at the map? Well they were— That was a train that
they were on, right? It was some form of transit. I was trying to figure out
whether it was a bus, but I'm pretty sure it's a train. And they're on the move. But that's not the way
you get to Basel Airport. I checked. The way
you get to Basel Airport is by a bus from there. Are they not doing Vienna? If they're not doing Vienna—
But why would they not be? The same reason they
weren't doing it yesterday. Maybe they've spotted something. Look, there's a rainbow.
There's a rainbow. Oh, look at that. Who-ho-hoa! It's— There's a
little rainbow in France because it is—
To celebrate its liberation. Here's the thing. We can get to the
Swiss-Austrian border seven minutes before their plane
would land. Yep. I don't know that
we can cross the border within seven minutes. We can look into it.
Yeah, we can look into that. There is a bridge
kind of near there. My opinion is that
even if they beat us to Austria, it would be good
to be near Austria because they—
we can be there doing the challenge
at the same time as them. Yeah.
So we could certainly be a— Even if they claim it first, we could be a strong
contender to steal it. Because they would have to get
three miles from the airport before they can even
open the challenge. Right, so we could actually
probably start the challenge first. Before them. I also don't even think
they're gonna go to Vienna. They might not.
They very well may not. I think they should know
it's too much of a risk. Are they gonna try and
pull a train across Switzerland to get to Austria before us? But they can't. We're gonna be there
in two hours. You say they can't. It's physics. I don't get it. And that's worrying. Off... to the
Austrian border then. They're going east.
Yep. The most relevant question is can they beat us
by train to Austria? I don't think so. Because we'll be there
in about two hours. Uh-huh.
If all goes well. The fastest route
that I can find off of, you know, admittedly
two minutes of research... would take... Hmm. I don't like that ""Hmm"". Two— Two hours and 45 minutes. Seems like the border town
is St Margrethen. If they left on this train, which sure looks like
they left on that train... Yep. They would get
into the border town, which is still in Switzerland,
at 11:43. What time do we land?
11:40. But, keep in mind... this is not... From there, they would have
to go on foot or something... to get into—
That's not far, Sam. It's not far.
That's really not far! It could be possible. And if our flight is
delayed a little bit, they could get it.
But our plane's right there, Tom. What could go wrong? (exhales shakily) You... nnngh. They're at the airport
right now. Can you see
what gate they're at? It's, I mean... you never know with these things
how accurate it is. But it looks like they're
at a gate in the mid A50— like A51, A53, A54, A52. 9:50 to Vienna is boarding. It's at gate A51. Sam, I really do not like how fast they're getting east. It's a high-speed line. Does it stop being
high-speed at some point? Yes.
Okay. After Zurich.
I just, I... 'Cause if they can
just pop into Austria, even if we get it first,
they're in position to a challenge. We gotta get outta the airport.
Yeah. We can't do a challenge within three miles
of an airport, right? Yeah, but also, yeah. (grumbles) But as far as— Twice, twice they've
surprised us in two days. Yeah. They're out on the tarmac. I think they're definitely
going to Vienna. Okay. We are going to get
to Zurich in 10 minutes. Let's go to St Margrethen. We walk over the border
into Höchst and we try and steal it. Yeah? (whispers) I think so. I think so. I think so. Alright. There's a train at 10:03
in three minutes. What platform? That goes to Rorschach
on platform 33. And we need to make that
to get to the Austrian border. Yep. Oh man. And that should be
no problem at all. It's gonna be so easy.
Not even close. Not even close. Doing it all with flight radar?
Yep. Well if their plane
gets delayed even like 15 minutes... could be huge for us. 'Cause then we might be able to
actually claim Austria first. Yeah. Okay. Platform 33. Here we go, buddy.
That's the train to Rorschach. Okay.
Yep. Come on.
Oh, beautiful. Just in time. Oh, the door literally
closed on me. What's it look like? It looks like
their flight is taking off. I think that's what it means when the line turns
from white to yellow. I think that might be the
prettiest takeoff I've ever seen. That was stunning! (sighs) Alright. First to Austria wins. Er, a point. But first to Austria wins a point that can then be stolen
by the other team. But you know what I mean. And it took off
17 minutes after scheduled. Which is actually...
It's pretty good. Pretty good.
Yeah. It makes me worried that
they're gonna get in even earlier. Yeah, me too. It's kind of fun
to be in a frantic race to the Austrian border,
but here we are. Having a little...
(cups clink) you know... espresso. With a tablecloth. I know. Look at that. That's a... That's a damn tablecloth. My opinion is that our show,
more than anything, is an advertisement for Eurail.
Yeah. Okay, Tom, so... I think I've identified the exact route they're on. Okay. I think pretty soon
they're gonna get off the train in... ""Rorschark""? Rorschach.
Ror-shark? Ror-shack.
Ror-shack. And transfer onto to this one
towards St Margrethen. If they do this, it looks like
we should beat them by a couple minutes. Haaugh. And we just gotta hope
we land first. It's gonna be tight. I hope they're stressing. They're probably looking
at our flight tracker. (laughs) I really hope
they're stressing! Adam has decided
he can't sit down anymore because the stakes are too high. And also he just— He's only had caffeine today. Uggh. Oouggh. (yawning)
It's gonna be so tight, Ben. They're gonna be watching
the dot on the flight tracker. Yeah, and the thing is,
this plane today is landing much sooner than the average
for this flight. Yeah. Yeah,
we've got lucky with this. Ben, their
estimated time of arrival has been moved up to 11:25. I don't love that. Ohh, it's gonna be tight.
It's gonna be tight. I think that they're gonna be
the first ones there by about 15 minutes.
But then... I think we'll be able to
start the challenge first. 'Cause they'll have to deplane, get through the airport,
get onto transit, get three miles away
from the airport. And I think that that will take
longer than 15 minutes. Yeah, it's gonna be close. Oh my god. It's gonna be close. What are the odds
that it keeps being this close? Yeah. It's fine. I really want this one. Yeah, well,
I really want all of them. Yeah, that's true. Because if we get it,
then the score is 4-2, and if they get it,
then it's tied. It's tied, but they have
a better route to more countries. I do think that they
might be overestimating how easy it's gonna be to do the run.
That route is not easy. That route is not easy. In fairness, yeah. How close are they? They're through
everything now. So they're about to
transfer again... there. But that thing where? No, no, no. Go ahead.
Go ahead. Say the name. Royzh—Royzhashberg. Rorschacherburg. No, that still sounds wrong. Alright. They need to get
across the border before we touch down there. Okay. Welcome to Rorschach.
Welcome to Rorschach. We got one more train, and then we can run
right over into Austria. I think that
they are landing in... five minutes. It's gonna be close. That's all we can say.
I can see their plane. Look, it's coming in to land.
Ugh. They're slowing down. Yep. Contact. Text 'em.
Text 'em. Text 'em. Text 'em. Let's goooo. You have the text prepared! Of course. With a lot of fire emojis, nice.
Seconds matter, Tom. Okay. Now we've just gotta see
whether they can steal it back. Yep, Austria claimed. Damn it. Ugh. I wanted that one.
Yeah, they got us. That's tough. That's tough to lose it by
10, 15 minutes. They got it for now.
Yep. I hope they enjoy it
while it lasts. But we're coming for you. We're gonna steal your Austria.
(zombie-moans) I think. Asterisk. Put an asterisk. You're revving up?
Yeah. There you go. Maybe we can fuel up with some weed-flavored
iced tea. Oh yeah.
They've still got it. That's what we're about to do. We're about to go Thurbo mode. We're going Thurbo mode. We're about to go
absolutely Thurbo mode. Austria, here we come. Okay. Oh, no. No, it's fine. They're still taxiing.
They're still taxiing. I think they're still taxiing.
I was about to say, what the (bleep) Oh no.
What? What? Oh, that's a bus. We're turning to the bus gate.
That's a bus. That's a bus. That's a bus. That's bad.
We got a bus gate. (laughs) (grumbles) It's bad luck.
That's bad luck. I feel like
I'm gonna throw up. Yeah. You have the challenge
ready to go, right? I'm ready to go. That's Austria. That's Austria. It sure looks like it. Alright.
Alright. Welcome to St Margrethen. We're still in Switzerland. We just gotta get over
the bridge into Austria and then we can start the steal. This time we're
not gonna stop the steal. No, we are starting it.
This time, we have to start the steal. We gotta keep counting. Alright. Okay. Come on, let's go. Alright, that was
a fairly efficient bus. It was...
but we still gotta try We've got other people
clearly going for challenges.
to get on the next train, yeah. (cackles) Even if the challenge is just
make a connecting flight. Come on. Need to find the train station. Yes. And look for
the fastest train to... Yes.
Wien Hauptbahnhof. There's fewer people
on this carriage down here. Okay, okay, so... We have all of these.
We could stop at Prater. Which is, that's tourist central. Okay, yeah. Wien Mitte is
Vienna City Centre Station. There are... There is literally
a shopping mall around it. I can't think of anywhere better
to do this challenge, Sam. Have they made it
across the border? Alright, they've made it
across the border. As we thought in St Margrethen,
so they probably just started it. Oh, they've literally
just crossed the border? We gotta get over the river. Okay.
Alright, we're in Austria. Okay. We are starting the steal. Here is the challenge. Play classical music on
non-classical instruments. Play classical music
on non-classical instruments. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
debuted in Austria in 1824. In this challenge, you must play
the famous ""Ode to Joy"" theme, but you may not use
any musical instruments. The challenge is complete
once you play the selected portion of the piece correctly:
all correct pitches, on beat, at least 140 beats per minute. You may rehearse
as many times as you'd like. You may only make
one official attempt at your performance. Okay.
Okay. We can do this. Okay, I'm gonna start looking up
where we can go get bottles. Because bottles are gonna
be the way to do this. You start looking up
""Ode to Joy"". Yep. And figuring out
how many notes are in it. Supermarket,
an eight minute walk this way. What about this?
There's a... something here. Okay, we can look at that. How many notes? Five. Only five?
Yeah. Five bottles. Do you think
they need to be glass? Glass is gonna be best
if they have glass, but plastic will work. Here, let's just get water here. Well, these are glass.
Where? These, great.
These will be great. Get seven of 'em
just for good measure. 4, 5, 6, 7.
Okay. Do we need a little thing to... ...ting them with? Yeah, let's get
a thing to ting them with. We'll use this. I think we might
wanna blow though. Oh, maybe.
Well, it's, you know. We'll see, we'll see. Thank you.
Thank you. Alright.
We can just do it right here. So here's the deal. We just have to prove that each one can
make the right note... And then we have to play it.
Yeah. We're using a tuner. (unpitched whistling) So you know, so you're gonna need to pour
out a little bit to get it. (B♭ whistling) That's a sound.
That's what you want. But I think tinging is
gonna be better. I'm just worried about
us getting it in tempo if we have to blow. That's true, that's
gonna be a lot harder. What are the notes
we have to get? G, A, B, C, D. And then another D
an octave lower. Okay, let's divide and conquer. You try to get notes G, A, and B. I'll try to get
C, D, and the other D. (repeated tinging) Are we pulling?
Three miles? We're at three miles.
Pull the challenge. Okay. Don't be a time limit.
Don't be a time limit. Play classical music on
non-classical instruments. We need bottles. This is a time consuming one, which I think is good for us.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we get to choose
when we do it. That's gonna be...
Yeah. Mind games, if they're
doing at the same— All correct pitches, on beat. Oh, how much...? (gasps) Oh, that's... that's so much
more than I thought. There's 16 bars there. (hums melody) 16 bars, perfect. It's not nothing. I... Sam? Mhm? There is an argument
for letting them fail this one. They are going to be panicking. (repeated metallic clanking) (multiple bottles clinking) Do we even need an F? What notes do we need? Are you having any luck? What? Are you having any luck? Not really. I can't really get it
to work that well. I see the argument. 'Cause I guess the risk is that if we attempt this first
and fail it first... They have all
the time in the world. Whereas... if we
let them attempt it first and they fail...
Mhm. It's ours for sure.
Yeah. I think we should proceed as if we're doing this for now.
Yeah. But I could see
a real discussion about whether we do
a real attempt. Yeah.
Depending on how... How easy or
how difficult it is. (bottles tinging) That's an F♯. (bottle tinging) I was like, how much do
I have to drink from F♯ to make it be a different note? Here, I'm gonna go over there. I'm having a lot of
trouble over here. It's really consistent
if I blow into it, but it's less consistent
if I plink it. I mean, blowing
will get different notes. (faint whistle) But I just don't know that
you can do it consistently. (near-B♭ whistle) You're pretty good at it. (alternating near-B♭ whistle
in two octaves) Let's see if we can
get it working this way. Yeah, okay. And see if I could
do the whole thing. (sustained whistle) That's a G.
That's a G. (whistle) That's an A.
That's an A. ♪ (A–G) ♪ That's pretty—
I think you were— you're doing that pretty fast. Okay, we'd have
to do a lot of practice, but I could probably get it. (A♭ whistling) (F whistle) Let's see what this is. (whistle)
That's a D. That's a D. We need a D. So I'm gonna do in-between notes.
I'm gonna do 'em in alphabetical order. A, D. This is going pretty fast. Yeah, but I'm just really
worried about playing it. But it's fine. Okay, here we go. Ready? Can you check where they are? Yes. Our train's stuck in a tunnel. We are nowhere near
Wien Mitte yet. Nope.
This is not good. (whistle) C.
That's a C. We need a C. Okay, so now we need a B,
which will be in between these two. (whistle) That's a B.
That's a B. A, B, C, D. G.
G. Then we need a B that
is an octave lower. Is what Amy wants. So that's gonna be
almost no liquid. (low whistle) It's a G.
It's a G. This is with no liquid. It might just be that
it can't go lower. (low whistle) Still a G. We need
a bigger bottle, I think. Okay, you... I'm gonna start practicing. I'll see if I can
find us another bottle. Here's what I think
is happening. I think they've already
found instruments. I think they're
not panicking at all. I think they are already rehearsing. I can't read (bleep)-ing music. I don't know what this starts on.
How many notes are in this? One, two, the highest note.
What's the highest note we have? The D?
♪ (D whistle) ♪ ♪ (slow whistling
""Ode to Joy"" melody) Right?
Yeah, that's pretty good. Look, man.
Right? Your only job right now is to find anything
that can make a lower D. There's something
else I can buy. I guess what it really
all comes down to, Tom... is how hard do they
think this challenge is? In some ways we're in
a bit of a standoff. Yeah.
'Cause it's like... Some— One of us has to
take the initiative and go, this is the performance. And that's the
pass or fail moment. Oh no, absolutely. But I keep going back
and forth, 'cause... on the one hand,
they have the time advantage. So maybe we just wanna... If we can—
We wanna pressure them. Well, we
wanna pressure them. But on the other hand,
we want to give it a shot. Same thing.
On locking this. I think twangy rulers
is our best shot. Okay. We can tune them,
we can lock them down, and then it's just a case
of playing 'em like a piano. Rulers, rulers, rulers,
rulers, rulers, rulers, rulers, rulers, rulers.
There's a plastic ruler. That, no, that's exactly it.
This is your twangy one. (ruler buzzing) Come on. Cheap plastic ruler. (ruler buzzing) Try changing the...
B. Yeah. No. Yeah.
That was a good shout. I'm annoyed by that.
Okay, well, let's see. Then it's six bottles, but we need to make sure we can—
they're glass bottles. We'll worry about
playing on the bottles. About what? Just the actual
playing of things. Yeah, no,
that's really difficult. ♪ (""Ode to Joy"" whistling) ♪ (mimes whistle) I've got it.
You just need the stupid D! Ouuaagh! Okay, I just need to find... This is a kebab place. They do have bottles,
but they're all the same size. We need like a big, big bottle. What is this? Oh wait.
It might be a grocery store. I think this is a grocery store. Oh, where... is the entrance? (breathy A whistle) Not reliably, not at speed. (sighs) Agh! I can only hope
that Adam and Ben are having the same problems. (sighs) Ben's coming
back with nothing. No? There's a grocery store
over there. They don't take Visa or
American Express, but they have
big bottles of wine. Okay, okay. Do you have cash?
I have euros, yeah. We're in the Eurozone.
I'll run, okay? Yeah, it's pretty obvious...
Check on them. (bleep) They're right by the station. They could complete
this challenge ...at any moment. Jesus Christ. So what else? We could make
wooden spoon maracas. That's not pitched. Paper straw pan pipes. Hello. (winces) That means having to
(blows) very precisely over
the right... thing, but... Elastic band guitar. I think of those, pan pipes
might be our best option. But it's just nailing the
(blows) Might be worth getting
them to see at least. Do you want me to see if
I can get them from that shop so you can stay with these?
Yeah. In case we want
to try more with these. Yeah. I don't think we're getting
our octave outta these. No. Come on Adam,
where are you? (chuckles despairingly) Folks...
He has the bottle of wine. Got it?
Yeah. Okay. We should
be able to make this work. Okay, get the tuner out. (whistle) C4.
C4. (whistle) A3. (low whistle) What's the (bleep)-ing order? If I can go below a G3,
what is that? (low whistle) E3.
We're almost there. (deep whistle) D3.
D3. Okay.
Okay. Do you wanna practice? So I'm gonna
practice a little bit. Practice a little bit. ♪ (whistling ""Ode to Joy"") ♪ Okay, can you
check what the tempo needs to be though?
What's 140 BPM? In seconds?
Well, just beat it out for me. I just wanna make sure
I'm going fast enough, or if I could slow down,
that'd be nice. (metronome ticking) That's 140? (whistling)
(metronome flickers off and on) Really?
But again— That's so (bleep)-ing fast. Sam, I've been
standing here for... a good five, six minutes now, just doing that with many
different tone generators. Mhm.
(glass tinging) And I'm sure...
with a laptop and a microphone, I can analyse this and
prove the pitches, but I... Yeah, I mean, it
doesn't help that we have... No.
a street going by. I could not find paper straws. Okay. I mean, a couple of thoughts... would be like one,
I think if we got... a taller, narrower glass.
Yes. I think the pitch effect
would be more pronounced based on water. Champagne flutes,
tall glasses, test tubes, anything like that.
Yeah. Let's try that. Okay, well shall we
get rid of these and then... Ugh, yes. ♪ (whistling with metronome) ♪ This is the hard part,
is getting this. 'Cause that's only
one (bleep)-ing note. ♪ (whistling in stereo) ♪ Raagh! Wouldn't we want
this to be near this? Yeah, maybe that is better. (metronome continues) (slow testing whistling) I hate how long
we're spending on this. I know we're not technically under
any big time pressure right now, but I wanna be travelling.
I wanna get to new countries. Just to gut check, we definitely want to
continue trying, right? (stammers breathily) Yeah. Well, we wanna
at least put the pre— How much have they rehearsed?
I don't know. Okay, I need
to do it successfully twice in a row. And then we'll be ready, okay. (whistling with metronome) (in montage)
Da da-da da da Da da-da-da
da da. (whistling overlapping) (metronome continues) How you feeling? Insane. Yeah.
I feel insane. Have you tried locking in? I'm still looking
for twangy things. Well, there's twine,
but that's not... That's not twangy enough. I mean, if you're
confident about... I'm really like...
There are rulers. Right. Oh, and this one's aluminium. So do you wanna just
buy one, twang it, see if we can get
a pitch out of it... If so, come back and
get the rest? Okay.
Okay. Right, here we go. Give it a good twang. Yeah. If this twangs and if we can get an octave
out of short and long, this is the easiest
possible solution. This is... It's aluminium. It should twang.
Yeah. Lemme find
somewhere to twang it. Where are you from? New York.
America. New York City?
Yeah. Oh yeah.
East Side. East Side. East Side.
Yeah. I like East and West. Yeah.
West Coast, Tupac. Can I do a photo?
Yeah, real quick. I gotta focus on this. (whistling to metronome) Peace, brother.
Say, East Side. East Side. How are you feeling? (metronome stops) I'm so scared. If I do it one more time perfectly,
we're going for it. Okay. (whistling with metronome) (ruler twanging) Maybe? (ruler buzzing semi-tonally) Come on.
Yeah? I mean, certainly getting a note.
Yeah. Question is, can we...
Can we get an accurate note? (ruler buzzing testily) (sighs angrily) (deep D buzz)
Oh. That is a D.
Yeah. (whistling over metronome) I think we gotta go for it.
Alright. (metronome continues) Okay, this is the one.
You got this. Okay, here we go. Three, two, one, go. ♫ (whistling ""Ode to Joy"") Yes! Ohhh!
Let's call them, let's call them. Let's (bleep)-in' go!

Welcome to the ad read. We know that sometimes you get
a little bit bored with these. So Adam is going to play us
a beautiful song in the background to entertain you. Take it away. Now, here's what
we have to tell you, okay? The next episode of
Jet Lag: The Game is up right now on Nebula. Uhh... yeah. Nebula... Sorry. Nebula is a streaming service that is home to all sorts of
really good content. Not only just
every single episode of Jet Lag one week early, but also we do a podcast there. Yep, an aftershow podcast
called The Layover. It's good. We talk about
the behind-the-scenes. Tom will be there. We try to justify our strategy.
We chat with Tom. Yep. We've made other shows
for Nebula too. Remember when
we took you to Utah? Yeah, we made a show
called The Getaway, where essentially we had... six contestants,
and we sort of... tricked them all into
thinking that they were all... basically the mole,
but only... ...No. They all thought that
they were the secret saboteur and they were all trying
to not get discovered but they were all playing
the same role. We take a trip across
the whole American West. Yeah, but it's six people
all trying to... stay covert, and... Just watch the trailer
or something. I don't know. I'm so distracted. Anyway, fortunately for you, we've got a promo code
for Nebula if all of this sounds enticing. Uh-huh. Do you remember it? I don't remember it. It's nebula.tv/jetlag. And that gets you 40% off. That's $36 for an entire year
of streaming. Watch all of our stuff, and...
we haven't even talked about all the other Originals and
all the other creators on there. There are a bunch.
You probably already watch them. Keep going.
It's good stuff. Alright, Adam, let's
wrap this up into a grand finale. nebula.tv/jetlag Watch the next episode now. Thank you for your support. (wheezes)

Schengen Area, and the board for our most ambitious
country claiming game ever. We're here outside
Victoria Station in London, because over the next six days,
we're gonna compete to see which team can visit
the most European countries. But right now, it's 6:30 am... So we gotta go, go, go! Get the camera,
get the camera, get the camera! Let's go! Alright, Ben! Let's gooooo! This way!
We gotta plan. We gotta plan. In this game,
the goal is simple: The team that controls
the most countries at the end of six days wins. In play are the 29 countries
in the Schengen Area, plus these microstates. To claim a country,
all we need to do is go there. We can take as many trains,
buses, or ferries as we like, and we have a $4,000
budget for flights. Once we've claimed a country,
it's ours, but it's still vulnerable to
being stolen by the other team. If we want to
permanently lock down our ownership of
a particular country, we'll have one attempt to complete
that country's challenge. These challenges were all written
by our colleague Amy, so none of us will know
what any of them are until we open
that country's envelope and read the challenge. If we complete
the challenge successfully, that country is locked
and it will remain in our control until the end of the game. But if we fail or choose not
to attempt the challenge, the opposing team could
attempt to steal it. If they travel to the country and complete
its challenge successfully, then they'll steal control and lock it down for
the rest of the game. So now both, teams are off to figure out how they're
going to get out of London and where they want to head first
to start claiming countries. Okay.
Alrighty. Here's the basic situation. There are three potential
opening options. Three clusters of countries. One option is that
you take the Eurostar and you kind of hit
the Benelux area: France, Belgium,
Netherlands, Germany. Potentially you get
Luxembourg in there. I suspect that
they're really gonna wanna do that. Tom, wait! Alright, alright,
right, right, so... Alright.
Eurostar, right? Clearly train.
Clearly the train. I think so. Well, let's check the schedules
of the Eurostar. Second option:
You fly to Vienna, and you can pretty quickly get
Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. And this, is, you know, we've talked about
this option a lot before. They're definitely
gonna consider that as well. I mean, the only other thing,
as I'm sure they know, would be that there are
a lot of countries near Vienna. Yes. I think there are two
really obvious plays. Yeah. But there is also
a secret third option that has not yet come up
in the group playtesting. No, I don't think
they've considered it. And that is to fly
to Zurich, Switzerland, because from there,
you can get Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, and in fact, if they
take the Eurostar, you can get to Germany
before them and steal it right out
from under them. Let's take a look at the tracker. 'Cause we can tell
if they're gonna go for the Eurostar pretty quickly when they leave here.
Yeah. We have their location.
They have our location. Yeah.
So... (laughs) We could wait
to see what they do! They could make
the 8:30 to Vienna, which is currently running
15 minutes late on the flights. Well, here's actually
the interesting thing. That's not showing
as bookable anymore. Oh? Then the obvious play is... train, train. Yeah.
Let's go. Just go up to St Pancras?
Yeah. Alright, let's do it. Oh, they're moving.
They're moving. Oh, they're
getting on a train. Let's follow them
and see what they're doing. Okay. Stealth mode. You see them?
I don't see them. No, they've disappeared.
They've disappeared. They've done a
wonderful disappearing act. Okay. I should introduce myself, and let the audience
that don't know me: Hi, I'm Tom. I run a podcast called Lateral
about weird questions, which the three have been on. And I used to do
a lot more videos on YouTube than I do now. Tom is known for
having been everywhere. I'm not Bob Dylan. That's Johnny Cash!
It's Johnny Cash! Train number one of
how many do you think, Tom? Far too many. I don't think there's any
such thing as too many trains. (chuckles) Okay, yes, it looks like
they're going north. Okay.
To St Pancras. Which would mean...
Just as I suspected. That they're doing Eurostar, which means that
we should go to Heathrow. So predictable, boys. If we wanna get
that flight to Zurich, we gotta go now.
Okay, how do we get there? We need to get on
the District Line, Benjamin. District Line.
Oh, then, we shall. Then we shall get on
the District Line. District Line.
I think this is us. We're getting on the Tube. Mind the gap between
the train and the platform. Alright, let's go. Uhh yeah, this way. Got a British train
trivia fact for you. I know all the trivia, Tom.
Mhm. How many international stations
are there, in the UK? There's this.
Yep. Ashford International.
Yep. I think Ebbsfleet is one.
Yep, yep. And you're probably gonna try
to trick question me with Dover. How many of those have
international service? One. Just this one.
Well, there's— No, there's the—
there's the shuttle. Nope, not an
international station. But you go—
The only— There are loads of stations with
'International' in the name, and only one of them is
actually international. But you have the international
service at that one. Welcome to St Pancras! I think you're
changing the subject, Tom. Okay, Ben,
we just got service. I can confirm that
they are at St Pancras. This also means that
they know where we are. They are gonna now know
that we're headed to Heathrow. It'll be interesting to see
if they can figure out that we're gonna scoop them. Yeah.
In Germany. I don't know. Okay.
Alright, well... Those are our choices. So we have to take... A: the one to Paris nonstop... 9:01 to Lille or Brussels. I... do not like Paris as an option. Yeah, no, definitely. It's 'cause the thing is,
from Brussels... you can get pretty quickly
to Germany, to the Netherlands. Luxembourg. Back to France
if you wanted to. Yeah.
So we're in a great region. That's a good point. We can go back to France
from Brussels if you want to have 'em. I think... we want to take
the 9:01 to Brussels because we can pass
through France. Yeah. Claim the country.
We won't lock it. We can claim it
and claim Brussels. And if we need to, if it looks like there
might be a threat that someone's gonna
take France away from us, we can go back there. Just real quick, something Tom and I
forgot to mention here: While the train to Brussels
does stop in Lille, France, allowing us to theoretically get out and attempt the challenge
to lock France, there's not a train today from
Lille to Brussels until 1:30, meaning we'd lose several hours
just waiting around in Lille. That's why we're planning
to stay on the train through Lille and get off in Belgium:
claiming France, but not locking it. Yeah.
Any challenge to France would not be for days.
Yeah. So it'd be safe to
not lock it immediately. So I think I like the plan
of going to Brussels, even though it wastes us,
I mean... ...an hour and a half. Yeah, but they're gonna
be wasting their time at airport security and check-in. Let's check the tracker.
Yeah. Flight leaves in 62 minutes. Yeah, flight leaves in an hour. Alright.
We got it. The old travelator is broken. But we got two freaking travelators extending from our torsos. That's so true. The lads are at Heathrow. Alright. I realize you call 'em like...
other than the lads. But I'm British.
So I'm calling them the lads. Okay. You can call 'em what you want. (laughs)
I've got some ideas! They're at terminal two,
which is Austrian Airlines. Okay.
So... I guess they're going
to Vienna? Everything fits. I don't know why they'd
do anything but that. So...
They're going to Vienna. Yeah. They're going to Vienna,
which means good news. We don't have to worry about them
interfering with our plans today. God damn!
I know. Okay, well, we've burned
about 10 minutes just getting to the terminal. As long as the security's
not that bad, we should be fine. Security's that way. Fast track. Look how luxurious. We are fast tracking. Hopefully we don't
need that $30 later. Alright, carriage one,
seat 68. Tom, do you know why
the Eurostars are so long? I don't know why
the Eurostars are so— Oh, because any train
in the Channel Tunnel needs to be able to split into two
and hold all the— Hi, thank you. (laughs) That would've been bad.
That would've been bad. Yes, you're right.
It's the Channel Tunnel. Yeah, they have to be able to
evacuate all the passengers in either half of the train. In case, yeah, one power car breaks down.
That's a big reason why it's been so hard for
other train companies to start service.
Right. No problem.
Nailed it. We did get randomly selected, so truly everything that
could have gone wrong did go wrong, but we're fine. I tell you one thing, Ben. They definitely did not
take the 8:01 to Paris. It's very curious. I really thought if they
were gonna take the train, they were gonna take
the earlier one. I mean, maybe they aren't
gonna stop and do challenges. Maybe they're just gonna go
straight through to Brussels. Guess we'll see.
But we know where we're going. Zurich, baby. Off we go.
It's Zurich time. So... I mean, we've
got a lock on them. We know where they are.
Yeah, and it— And we know
what gate they're at. Certainly looks
like the right one for the live location of the London to Vienna flight.
Yeah. So I think we can
consider that confirmed. Right. Which means they're not
gonna bother us today. Yes. Is that it?
And that is the tunnel. Good bye, Britain.
We're on our way. Tom now thinks
we're leaving the tunnel. Let's see. Oh, nailed it. Thank you. Nailed it.
I'll take that. Nailed it.
Wait, we can text them. Oh, we can text them, yes.
We're in the lead, Tom. France claimed. Okay. That is one-nil. We have the
psychological advantage. And we're about
to get to two-nil before they can get
their first country. But we haven't locked France.
We have not locked France. We're not going to right now.
Yeah. Certainly not now.
We have no— I mean, we're not gonna
get off and do it. No. I hate that we are... going through so many countries
without locking them. We don't need to right now.
They're not on our tail. They're off sorting
themselves out in Vienna. Hello.
Guten Tag. So we're about
20 minutes from landing. Slight wrinkle. We've been looking
at our options to Germany. We realized
that if they decide to go straight to Germany... If they skip
the France challenge, leave France vulnerable...
Skip the Belgium challenge... Yeah, they skip
the Belgium challenge. They could beat us there... by about 15 minutes. We don't have service
right now, so... We don't know
what they're doing. We will know... what they've done
when we land. (inhales deeply)
Yeah, we'll see. Oh, there we go. Oh. There's Belgium.
That is Belgium. Country number two.
Eyy! Country number two. Let's text 'em. Belgium claimed. Two-nil. So the question is now,
what next? We want to at least
tick off Germany. And the Netherlands.
And the Netherlands. I don't think we're gonna
make it to Luxembourg, or that there's a good way to
make it to Luxembourg. No, 'cause the train
down to there takes like three hours.
Yeah. Most geographically close.
Yeah. There is a high-speed line
from Brussels into Germany that goes through Aachen. And then from there,
we can take a relatively short train to Maastricht, Netherlands.
Right. Once we're in
Aachen and Maastricht and Liège, that area,
we're about equidistant between Brussels and Dusseldorf
and Cologne Airport. It's kinda an hour and a bit
in either direction. But the thing is, no matter where
we want to go tomorrow, there's a thing that seems
to basically always happen where there are morning flights
and evening flights. And there aren't
midday flights, 'cause the commuters go
morning and evening. Yeah. The thing that
we need to think about is, what is more worth it? Is it locking countries today
or getting on those flights that we want tomorrow morning?
Mmmh. Honestly, I think it is unlikely that we will be able to lock
Germany, Netherlands, and Belgium (sighs)
and get back by the end of the day. I agree. But I think we need to lock
as many as we can. Yes. Alright, Ben.
A lot of stuff going on. But we gotta get
off the plane first. Tom, I have news. (cracks up)
I don't like this. You've got an ominous voice,
and you're filming. I don't like this at all. They're not in Vienna. They're not in Vienna?
Where did they go? We even checked the gate! Zurich. It was like— There was also a Zurich flight
leaving right next to them at the same time. Why Zurich? That's certainly interesting. They might be about to
make a run for Germany. (grumbles) We thought they weren't
gonna interfere with us. Okay. Yeah. Oh, that would make sense. But... That would absolutely make sense. (exhales loudly) Augh! That's annoyingly good. They can challenge France.
They can claim Germany and try it. And they've got Switzerland. And they've got a very easy run
to Vienna tomorrow, haven't they? I have forgotten Liechtenstein. Mhm? (hoots quietly) Oh, oh, we could. Alright, Adam.
Welcome to Switzerland. Alright, Switzerland
is now claimed. Claimed.
Not locked. Not locked.
But claimed. Oh, lots going on. We are entering
the Schengen Zone. Here's the situation. They have figured out
what we are doing and they're making
a beeline for Germany. They certainly are. I think that means
that they can beat us there by like 15 minutes. Yeah, depending... on how quickly we get
outta here though. We could beat them to Germany.
Yeah? Because if they get
on a train in six minutes, which they're not going to,
I don't think... No, there's no way they're
off the plane this early. They would get there 1:28.
We're gonna get there at 1:36. So if we're fast
with the challenge... This is assuming
they're going to Basel. Yeah. If they beeline to Germany, there might be
a faster route there. I didn't look that much, but... Germany is not afford—
Germany is not certain. So, we still run for
Germany fast as we can? Think so, yeah.
Alright. It's less ""mind the gap""
and more ""mind the gaping abyss"". Ah, alright, let's go. Welcome to Brussels, Tom. We wanna make a train
in 20 minutes. Right. That'll get us
super fast to Germany. You think we can
beat them to Germany? Maybe.
If they're going that way. Maybe they're
not going that way. Maybe they're gonna pull
a challenge card in Switzerland and see what we do. Well, I looked
at the train to Basel. Yeah?
And if they're going to Basel... we can beat them, I think. But there might be a route... Zurich Airport is not far
from the German border. It's possible that
there's another route, even like on buses maybe, that could take them
over the border. But it would require them
to take a less advantageous route in order to have a higher
chance of competing with us. Which is not a good strategy. Maybe it is. I don't know.
It depends on risk. But that doesn't change
what we need to do, which is— No. We need to just get to Germany as quickly as possible,
and go from there. We're going to
Germany regardless. Alright. I guess we've just
gotta hope that... their immigration at... at Zurich Airport is slow,
but it's Zurich Airport. Yeah.
It's not gonna be. Swiss efficiency.
Yeah. Well, good news. We made it through customs
in like... five minutes. Yeah, but... 12:06 was the train
we needed to make. And it's 12:09.
Yeah, I'm not sure that it actually
opens up any options, but we're gonna...
we're gonna hurry and see. The name of the game
right now is just, can we beat them to Germany? We'll do the challenge
here later. We're not worried about that. Yeah. There's just— There's gotta be a way
to do this, man. Platform 3.
""Liege""? Liège? ""Leis""? That one.
Yeah. Right. They're not even boarding yet. Sam, this is a
Deutsche Bahn train. I... I have watched Jet Lag. I know how slow
and how inefficient Deutsche Bahn has been
for you in the past. Zug fällt aus.
What does that mean? Noooo. Zug fällt ""auf"". I know what that means. They're all delayed. None of this makes any sense. None of this makes any sense! (cracks up) The train is
delayed for 45 minutes. We're gonna blame this one on
our good friends Deutsche Bahn. It's here. We're good. It's here. It's perfect weather outside. Yeah, it's windy
out there, you know. You know, it is the kind of weather
that trains in Germany absolutely love to plow through. Let's see where they are. Yeah. I mean, they're probably doing a whole thing right now
about like... how fast do we need
to get to Germany? Yeah. If they have a route,
and they consider it to be worth it, they're gonna take it.
Yeah. Ooh, ooh, what's this? Oh, Ben. Yeah?
This is it. What? If we can get
on this 12:19 train, that's our ticket. When does that
get us into Germany? It gets us through Germany
20 minutes before them. But we would be
passing through... We need to declare.
Adam, where are you going? It gets us through Germany way faster than them,
and then we would double back. But I think we would
even still be able to start the challenge before them. Go.
I'm, I'm... I'm looking into their
route options to Germany. Mhm?
And I'm feeling... cautiously... cautiously optimistic.
(chuckles warily) Okay. That we will at least be
the first ones... Across the border.
to cross the border. It's... it's... it's tight. I think we're gonna make it. Okay. This all obviously assumes that
they are heading up to Germany. But I have to believe that they are. They will... They're gonna know
we're going to Germany. 'Cause why would we
not go to Germany? Yeah, obviously.
And... I know this is the kind of
thing that temps fate, but like I don't... ...think they have a route from Zurich Hauptbahnhof
into Germany quicker than us at this point. What's it looking like? Start— They're on the move. Okay. They're on the move,
and I can't tell where, but I think it's Aachen. I think that they're doing
what we think. Okay, well— Okay, we need
to get to platform— They're going to Aachen.
We've gotta go to Schaffhausen. You know the saying. Adam, I have bad news.
What's that? It's a German train. Well... This is never a good sign. Is this first class?
This one is for children. There's no one in
the one for children. I don't wanna go in
the car that's for children. Okay. Ohhh. This was supposed to be so easy. We were just gonna go and we were gonna
swoop up and get Germany, and they were gonna be
none the wiser. Oh man.
Oh, okay. This... And the German train
has left exactly on time. (exhales deeply) Okay, it's just one stop. Okay. I don't know if they're
gonna see this move coming. I think that they think... they scooped our scoop.
But we have re-scooped. We did a re-scoop,
and that's actually key. This game is all about
scooping and re-scooping. It's mostly a game
about scoops, so... So, based on the tracker, they're both still
in Zurich Station, and the train— Ooh. Now they're moving.
Now they're moving out. I can see that moving.
Now they're moving out, but... that's three minutes later
than the train to Basel. So, okay,
what train are they on? I dunno. Okay, so... here's the deal. So this train is gonna
cut through Germany. Pretty early. So we'll definitely be
in Germany first, which means that
we'll have claimed it. Not locked it, but claimed it.
Yes. But we can't get off
the train in Germany 'cause there's no stop there. Yeah, it'll actually go back
into Switzerland and stop there. So we're gonna have to ride it
one more stop up into Germany. Into Singen. Yeah, and then
we can get off there and do the challenge. You want some intel? Yeah.
Not going to Basel. Oh? Their train has turned north. North? North, which...
Where...? That could be a train
towards Germany. Okay. Because the borders get
weird around there, right? Yeah, and I honestly,
I don't know... because I didn't have enough time
to look at all the options. I don't know whether
they can beat us. (whispers) Okay. We're getting close. Yep. Sounds like you've got news. I might have news. I found a train line... that would beat us
Okay. to Germany.
Alright. And it matches with
the route that they're on, and it matches with
the departure time. So, I think they've got Germany. Okay. Here's the thing. They might still fail the challenge. Germany might still
be open for later. Benjamin... I'm thrilled to welcome you to
the wonderful country of Germany. Excellent. Let's inform them. (both sigh) They're not gonna like that. Feels so good to be
in Germany. They're not
going to like that. (grumbles) Okay. Here's the question, Tom. Mhm? Do we continue on to... Aachen? I feel the
correct strategy is... I would rather lock down
Belgium and Netherlands and have a chance of
solidly getting that. Yeah. Rather than taking a punt
on doing a challenge, wasting time on the challenge,
and still being beaten. I think I agree.
That's gonna suck. Yeah, I agree. I think we run. I don't think it's worth...
As in we get off in Liège. Yeah.
I think I agree... because... I really want to take one of those morning
flights tomorrow and therefore inevitably,
one of the three countries here, we're just gonna have
to claim, but not lock. Just real quick, part of why we're under
such a time crunch here is that the game day
ends at 5:30 pm, then we will restart at
7:30 am the next day. That means if we wanna make a flight
first thing in the morning, we need to end our day
near an airport. So that should be Germany.
So if— We've got competition for it.
Yeah, if they've— If they're getting Germany, we should just let them
have Germany. Yeah.
And invest our time in the places that are
not a 50-50 shot where we can at least
be first one there. That's crazy.
Yeah. Ben, it's bundling up time. Well, let's bundle up. It's simply time to bundle. Belgium. The minute we open that...
things start to happen. High speed. This is it. Right. We have just under— right.
(laughs) Okay, yes. Go, go, go, go, go. Alright. Come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go.
This is lovely. Look, the stairs are right there.
This is perfect. So should I—
Okay, excellent, yeah. Pull it, pull it, pull it. Oh, here we go.
We're getting started. Play waffle pong. Play waffle pong. Belgium is known for their waffles. Get a waffle and
one container or package of a food that comes in pieces that would fit in
the waffle's holes. Think M&Ms, gummy bears,
peas, that kind of thing. Place the waffles six feet or
two meters away from you. You must land a small food in each of the waffle's
complete holes to win. You may only throw each
unit of small food once. If you run out of small food and have not filled
the waffle, you fail. Regardless, you must
eat the waffle and anything you caught in it
at the end of the challenge. Regardless,
you must eat the waffle and anything you—
Let's go get a waffle. Come on, right.
Okay, so we need the... We need a waffle with few holes.
We need a con— No, we need— We need a convenience store
that has small, cheap waffles. There's a Carrefour. Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go. Oh, Tom's going very fast. Alright.
Alright buddy. We're in Germany. Let's get— Welcome to Germany. Let's get to an open spot and let's open up
the stinkin' challenge. I'm scared Ben.
I'm scared too. Look how cute. Pretty cute. Let's go set it up and
let's kick it, buddy. Yep. It's time to open
the Germany challenge and see what it is. Eat a food in
its namesake place. Eat a food in
its namesake place. Tons of foods are named
after German places – hamburgers, frankfurters,
and pilsners, to name a few. To complete this challenge,
you must eat a food in the geographic area
from which it derives its name. You have 30 minutes after
you enter a geographic area to take a bite of its titular food.
You may only attempt once. If you are currently
in a geographic area with a food named after it, your 30 minutes starts
when you realize that. Oh dear. We may not be. This could be a problem. Let's find out. I'm actually pretty
worried about this. Are they still
heading towards Aachen, or are they stopped?
It's hard to tell. I think that either they got out
or their train is delayed. Bakery, bakery,
bakery, bakery. Tiny waffles. These are technically waffles.
Now— No, that. See, those holes
are a little— they're a little tight.
Yes, okay. We want deep,
large holes, I think. You— you make your own jokes. Food named after Singen. Maybe we should
just look around and we see if we see
anything named after Singen. Oh, no. I don't... This is not good. This is not good. Look, this one
only has 1, 2, 3, 4, and they're deeper. Okay, that waffle. Now we need tiny food things
to throw into it. So...
Oh, well... (yammers) That is a single cone
of pick and mix. It's true that
that's a container. Yeah, okay. I think that's fair
that this is a container. Yes. Let's do it. Let's just look in the
convenience store and see. No. Hi. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Black Forest cake. Black Forest region. We can get into the
Black Forest region if we get on that train. If we get on
the train to Basel? Yeah. I think, I think. I still don't know
if we're gonna be able to do that in 30 minutes. But we can try. Alright, let's go. I think let's go
under the cover. Yeah, agreed. 'Cause the rain may have
stopped for now, but... Step one... we've gotta find the waffle
with the fewest holes. That's a four hole waffle. See if we can beat four. That's a three—
That's a two hole waffle! Really?
That is a two hole. There are only—
That's— Mm. Is that one a— That's not a hole. No, it's not complete.
That's not a hole. That's a two hole waffle.
I mean, there, I don't— We're not gonna beat that.
Physics, we can't beat that. Alright. Right, we're gonna go
one at a time. Try and get my eye in. Oho! Come on! Hit the waffle
on the first attempt. And the second. This is more difficult
than we hoped. So we need Black— We need to eat Black Forest cake
in the Black Forest region. This goes into the
Black Forest region? It should based on what I saw. And if we— and if it doesn't,
we wanna get on it anyway. Right, 'cause it goes to Basel. Oh, come on! Hold up. Why are we— Why do we
not have a backboard? I don't know. Sam, there's... Put it against the wall! Okay.
Put it against the— Why are we not putting
it against the wall? Get out of there, pigeon.
(bleep) off. Oh!
That was close. That was close. Oh, that rolled up it! Oh, come on, you son of a... Oh! This is infuriating! (gasps) Yes! Alright.
Yes! Alright, alright.
Come on! Alright, you've got your eye in.
Lock in. Yeah— no!
No, it's the wrong hole. No, it's the wrong hole.
It's the wrong hole. It's the wrong hole.
It's not even a real hole. It has been 15 minutes. No.
Did you just— Okay, so now we
need to make a plan for exactly how we're gonna
get cake once we get there. I'm going through
this supermarket's website, which is all in German. But I found a category
for Tortin. Okay, we need Schwarz... Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte. I'm trying to figure out
which part of that word means which thing. Can we assemble
a wall of waffle? Doesn't say we can't. Yeah— It's the other hole! Okay, well, at least
it's definitely... It's definitely possible. It bounced off the waffle wall
and went in. The strategy works. (gasps) Not the right hole. We got another hole? Oh, come on,
Sam, you're so close. Ohh.
Ohh, no! Come on.
No, no, no, no, no! Okay, okay.
Well we have a knock— We can knock—
We have a knockin. Knockin potential.
We have a knockin. Surely, surely. Tom, come. (both groaning) Oh, you've got
two in the wrong hole! That... sounds weird. How do you spell—
According to this, they are still at that station. How do you spell—
Okay, I've got it. They're either stuck there or...
I don't know what they're doing. No! No, no, no, no! Keep going, keep going.
Keep going! We can knock that in. No! (gasps)
Come on! At this point, this is absurd. Gah, how?! That's the game! Let's call them.
Let's call them. We've got— no,
we've gotta eat the waffle. No, well, let's
call them as we eat it. Oh, I think that
they just claimed Belgium. Locked Belgium? I think they just
locked Belgium is my guess. Hey, look. Tom's eating a
delicious little snack. Because we've just
completed waffle pong. We have successfully
thrown little candies into the waffle holes.
That's fun. (full mouth) As soon as this
goes down my gullet hole... in about a minute,
we will have locked the great country of Belgium. Look at his gullet hole! His gullet hole is winning
this for us. Congratulations. Congratulations
on what's happening with your gullet hole. It's very impressive. We're very impressed by it. Good timing actually. Can you start
cleaning up the violets? I'm gonna try and get
this down my throat. These taste awful. The little purple things?
Mhm. Explains why there were
so many of them left. There we go. Belgium locked! Oh, that was a
crisp high five, Tom. First locked country.
Mhm. How does that feel,
Ben and Adam? I'm a little bit annoyed
that they claimed Belgium, but I'm glad, obviously, that they decided to do
the challenge in Belgium. Slowing down their ability
to get to Germany. Because now I think
we can complete this challenge. And we're already on our way
back towards France. I don't think
that they realized that if they had
just gone to Aachen, they would've actually
would've been able to beat us at the challenge.
Yeah. Probably.
Probably. Because Aachen has that pastry
that's named after it. Yeah. Jet Lag is an
ethical travel show. And therefore
we clean up our trash. Do you want
something to sweep with? There's gotta be
something to sweep with. Eh. I think it's fine. (belches loudly) Oh, sorry.
Oh my god. (laughs) Got a request for you, Sam.
Yes? Whatever we just spent
on pick and mix and waffles... will Jet Lag give
that to a food bank or a charity or
something In Belgium? Yeah.
Alright. Then I don't feel too bad
about wasting some... very cheap, terrible food. Look, we're taking this
outta the supply chain for children, right?
(laughs) That's our ethics for the day. Maastricht, 2:08?
Yep. Okay, so...
So that's— Let's say that's
an average challenge. That took us how long? About 45 minutes.
About 45 minutes, okay. In Maastricht,
if we want to get back to either Brussels or Cologne...
Mhm. ...by the end of the day,
we're not gonna have 45 minutes. How long do we have?
I think about 30. 30 to 40, depending on whether
we go to Brussels or Cologne. I am furious with myself for missing the camera shot of me choking that waffle
and those violets down. There'll be many
missed camera shots. (sighs) So, just gonna say
a thing, Tom. This train does go to Aachen
via the Netherlands. Yes, it does.
Just to say that an option... is to auto-claim the Netherlands... and just stay on this train
and go to Germany. They have to call us
if they fail the challenge as well, right?
Yeah. So I think the only scenario,
which you maybe wanna consider that, is if they do fail.
Yes. (whispers) That looks like
Black Forest cake. That's gotta be Black Forest cake. What bakery are you looking at? ""Backert""-Konditorei. Yeah, that does look
like potentially it. My worry is like,
what if it's closed, and they just didn't update it because of the Epiphany? Right. Yeah, a bunch of stuff
seems to be closed today... in Germany. So... we might be screwed. So we have entered
the Black Forest region. We just nicked it
about 45 seconds ago. Okay. So... Got a half an hour
to find this cake... ...and eat it too. We'll get off
at the next stop. Which is only in a few minutes. We'll have 25 minutes to
try to find this cake and eat it. Well, the thing that we
need to figure out now, Tom... And this is a much bigger decision
Mhm. is where are we
going tomorrow morning? Yeah.
Are we going to Copenhagen? Are we going to Nice?
Are we going to Vienna? And the real decision... If we wanna go to Vienna,
we want go to Cologne tonight. If we want to go to
Nice or Copenhagen, we want to go to Brussels. The thing is, if we knew... that they were not
going to Vienna... Would we go? I think the answer
would be yes. It would be silly not to. 'Cause we can get three,
maybe four countries. The thing is—
We just— We don't want to have
a fight on our hands. But here's the thing. If we do have a fight, it's because
they haven't gone to... Liechtenstein and Austria. And there isn't
anywhere else on the map where we can go and
get that much stuff. Mhm.
Yeah. Starting to look Dutch.
I was just thinking that. Long skinny houses.
Yep. Oh, yep, that's us.
Are we past the border? Yep. Welcome to the Netherlands. Welcome to the Netherlands. 3-2 with a country locked. Let's get some cake. Okay, you know
where the bakery is? They've claimed
the Netherlands, Ben. Claimed the Netherlands, okay. Good for you guys. Figured as much. It'd be interesting to see
if they can lock it, I suppose. Yeah, so the bakery is
right next to the train station. If it's not open,
then we start to panic. Great. Sounds like a good plan. Alright, Ben, we've got... 24 and a half minutes
to get this cake. How do we get
to the other side? I believe that's it.
That's it. It looks open, potentially.
It looks... The lights are on. Cake, cake, cake. Oh, there's somebody in there.
Okay, good. Good, good, good. Okay, they're open. Let's just hope they've
got Black Forest. Hi.
Oh. Uh-oh. Doesn't look like it. Do you have Black Forest cake? (indistinct) Do you have this? Nein.
No. Okay. No. Okay, that's really bad. Okay. Plan part two: panic. So to get to Cologne
by the end of the day... Mhm. We need to leave
Maastricht at 3:23. Alright, what time
do we get into Maastricht? 2:43. 2:43, that's
40 minutes on the nose. We have a shot. So we have exactly
40 minutes in Maastricht... (both giggle) to try the Netherlands challenge.
Yeah. Let's do it. You're gonna be really annoyed
if this involves eating something. Is there anything else open?
I'm looking. Okay, there's a different bakery... ...this way. There's also a restaurant
open called I Love Burger. Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna do it. Super closed.
Super duper closed. Okay, we should see
if there's anything in the convenience store, Ben. At the train station?
At the train station. It's not over yet.
It's not over yet. We still have 19 minutes.
Okay. Nope, it's closed. Closed. Okay. Okay. What about in here? I don't think so. Rather sparse offerings here. Okay, we need
to do some research. Maybe something else at that bakery is
named after the region. You never know. Black Forest ham? Is there any chance
that we could get Black Forest ham somewhere? There's a butcher shop,
but it's closed. I see a butcher shop
that's open. It also looks like it might have... Let's just start walking here.
Okay, okay. Because this is towards
the other stuff anyway. Okay. Let's go.
Alright. 40 minutes
until our train goes. Welcome—
Build Jason his dream bouquet. Build Jason his dream bouquet. The Netherlands are
known for many things. It's not just bikes. Indeed, the Netherlands are
the flower shop of the world. So please assemble the bouquet
of Jason from Not Just Bikes' dreams to his precise specifications. Complete and send Jason
a picture of your bouquet within 30 minutes,
or you fail this challenge. Your time starts the next
time you touch a flower. You may not do any research,
flower acquisition, or assembly until then. Jason's specifications
are on our phones. So our time starts
when we touch a flower, but it doesn't matter because we've gotta be out here
in 40 minutes anyway, right? Yeah, so are you getting
his bouquet specifications? Yeah, I'm getting those now.
Surely they're orange. You would think so? That's a fancy website. Yeah, well done, Amy.
Oh god, it's a video. Oh god.
(groans) Alright, so the minute
we have to touch a flower to start this. Are any of these fruits
technically botanical flowers? They're flowers. Those are fruits.
Those are not flowers. Nope, flowers. Oh, there's
flowers here, alright. But they're pre-made bouquets.
You ready? 30 minute starts... now. Welkom in Nederland. Thanks for helping me out here.
We should go out for this. I've always
wanted a flower bouquet with at least six carnations
in three different colors, two Orange Gerberas,
a Christmas Rose, and an Alstroemeria,
and all filled out with some Mimosa. And while I could make this myself,
I'd much rather that you did it. Good luck! We need to find a flower shop. Simple as that.
We need to find a flower shop. You look for a ""shower flop"". I'll try to look what these are.
Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it. Hopefully we can just
give those to a florist. Bloemen & Planten. That way, let's go. Okay. How far is it, Tom?
Not far at all. Hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on. Sorry. The compass was off
by 90 degrees! Alright, we're
two minutes away, so there's a shot. Ooh, what's this?
It's an ice cream place. It looks like it has
some kind of cake. That is cake. Is that Black Forest cake?
Those are cherries. That's Black Forest cake.
That's Black Forest cake. Yeah.
Okay. We need to get that. One of these. Here? No, no. Yes, yes. Right, that's definitely
Black Forest cake. 100— 110%. Adam, I know my cakes. We gotta get it to the
Black Forest though. Here, do you have
a credit card on you? Mine are buried in my backpack. No cash? Cash?
Cash? Oh no. Ha.
Shoot, okay, let's see. Where can we get
German money? Okay, it says there's
an ATM really close by. But it might be in
a place that's closed. (bleep) Yeah, it's inside one
of these buildings. Oh, that is not a—
oh, we'll see. We'll see. I don't see any other florists
or anything 'round here. There are no other
florists in this town. Oh wow.
This is our only hope. Let's see what we
can get here, and then... Alright, do you wanna
put the camera down just to... Yeah, I'll speak. Hello? Do you speak English?
Yes, absolutely. We have instructions
for a bouquet. We are doing a game, and we have to find
a bouquet like that. Not everything. I have only
the Orange Gerbaras. Uh-huh. Christmas Rose is Finnish.
Ahh. Alstroemeria,
I don't have that. Okay.
Not now, and not anymore. And Mimosas,
not from this time. Alright. We have been given
a duff challenge I think. Christmas Rose,
that's just seasonal? Christmas, yeah, okay.
So nowhere will have it? Yeah, that's over
from the Christmas time. Mm, right.
But, it's Finnish. Mimosa's only one month a year.
Right. I mean, let's get what we can.
Only this? Yeah.
Yeah, so... Yeah, let's get what we can. Oh, wonderful. All together?
All together. Yeah.
Like this? That will do.
Thank you. Thank you.
Paying together? Do you take debit card? We have a card. Money order service. It says it's open.
This? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here we go, here we go. Yep, yep, yep. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
We still got nine minutes, Ben. They're having trouble
with our change. Okay, start looking up how we can—
I'm trying to figure out. I have no service.
I understand, I understand. I'm working on it.
I'm working on it too. Yeah, we can just
go straight across. Five minutes. Danke. Guten Tag. Let's kick it.
Alright. Okay. So, yeah, it's this way. Okay. 'Cause technically
we're just outside of the Black Forest
region right now. Actually, might be closer
than I want it to be. It's gonna be tight, actually.
It's gonna be very tight. Here's the deal.
We have five and a half minutes, and we have to get up to here. Is your knee okay?
No. Okay. We'll be fine.
Okay, okay. It is okay.
All good. Thank you very much.
Dankjewel. Here's the thing.
Yep. If we can't get
Christmas Rose... Yep— They can't get
Christmas Rose. (laughs ecstatically) Ben, Adam. If you somehow come
to the Netherlands and you are able to find plants
that are not in season from an actual florist...
Yeah. Honestly, they kinda
deserve that at that point. Well, at the very least, the one thing that I almost
sort of like about this is that they don't know
why this is failable. Yes. Yeah they don't.
Until they do. So they might be coaxed
to come to the Netherlands with something that—
It sounds like it's not impossible. Some flower shops might
still have Christmas Rose. Yeah. But it's a—
It's for Christmas. Yeah.
And it's now not Christmas. Ohh! Well, here's the thing.
We have time. Please send this to
Not Just Bikes for his approval.
The instruction was to send— It was to text it him
for his approval. That's in the challenge. Alright, just up there. Ben, take the cake,
take the cake. The cake.
Take the cake. Give me the cake.
Take the cake. Eat the cake. There we go.
Ah. With two minutes
and 15 seconds to spare. Germany... locked. Wow, that was—
Fuck you, Sam and Tom. You thought you could
get Germany today? Wrong. Wrong. Pretty good. It's pretty good. Let's call 'em.
Shout out Black Forest. I've lost my challenge card.
Hang on, where'd it go? We're getting a call.
Oh, oh. Wait, wait. Hide— hide these. Hello.
Hello. Gentlemen, we're
thrilled to announce that we have locked
the wonderful country of Germany by eating this delicious
Black Forest cake in the Black Forest region. Felicitaciones. Good luck with the Netherlands. Oh, we're J-chillin. Dankjewel. Bye.
Bye. Let's go steal France.
Yep. We're failing the challenge.
Might as well. But let's at least
send him a message. Should we let him know? I suppose, I mean,
do we want to double check that Albert Heijn
that had some flowers? Let's double check it,
but I think we're good. Just for the sake of...
Yeah. Okay, Tom,
this is our decision point. Theoretically, we could
take a train back to... ...Brussels right now.
Right. The thing is from Brussels, the flights to Vienna
are much more expensive. Oh, then no,
let's do Cologne. That's... Yeah.
Yeah. We're good. So, I mean,
the thing is they can— They will be able to see that the cheapest
flight to Vienna... Yeah.
is from Cologne. Maybe they figure it out
from that. I don't know. Yeah. And even if they do, I don't know if it's
the end of the world. You know what?
Why don't we leave it to them? They get to choose whether
they want the fight or not. Yeah.
Right now... No, we're the alphas, Tom.
What are we scoring? We're scoring three.
Yeah. We're scoring
three with one locked. They're on two with one locked?
Yeah. No.
We're the alphas. Then... Firstly, I hate that. But second... Let's bring the fight to them. You don't like exuding
alpha male energy, Tom? I... ...don't have a response
to that that's printable. Wow, that's crazy
that it was that close. We like to keep
things exciting here. Good news is... we are close to Basel. Yeah, yeah. And Basel is close to France. Yeah, so what
we need to do now is figure out, you know...
We know how to get to Basel easily. How can we get from Basel
actually over the French border, so that we can go ahead
and try to steal France? The key thing is, this France steal is
gonna be what determines if the day went better for us
or went better for them. Okay, but here's
the good news, Sam. Yes? We don't have to
go to Germany. But I think we are
going to Germany. We are. But we have no stress now about whether we're gonna
manage to get to Cologne in time to do a challenge.
Well, yes. Or anything like we don't— With the small exception of
we have to take Deutsche Bahn to get there, but...
Okay, yes, fair. But... Assuming perhaps optimistically
that Deutsche Bahn works... I don't know if
you want me to say this, but this route to Cologne does involve a
six-minute connection. Oh, now you tell me! But the good news is...
On Deutsche Bahn? if we miss that connection,
we're not fully screwed. It just becomes close for comfort.
Alright. We know we've almost
certainly failed the challenge, but do you wanna check
the Albert Heijn? I'll take the flowers.
Might as well, yeah. You've got the list.
Okay. Go on in.
I'll see you in a minute. I'll take this.
Yep. Okay, I am looking
for one of these guys. Definitely not. No dice. No good.
No good? No good, no Christmas Roses.
No good. Alright, well... That's the game. We are playing a game, and we had to go
and get some flowers. And unfortunately we have
failed the challenge. Would you like some flowers? Yes.
Happy New Year. Happy New Year. There you go.
Thank you. Have a good one.
Alright, we gotta dash. Have a good day. Alright, so, bad news:
challenge failed comprehensively. There is not another florist within half an hour.
Cannot be done. At least according
to that florist who seemed very trustworthy. And was also the only one
open in Maastricht. So, that's the bad news. The good news is we think the challenge
is actually impossible. I don't think it matters
that we failed this. What matters is—
No, it could even be good. If they come to Netherlands
and attempt this and waste all that time and...
Yeah. Let's give 'em a call.
Let's give 'em a call. But here's the thing, Tom. We gotta look really disappointed.
Yes. I know that we're not
that disappointed, but like... Yep. We gotta act. Oh, they're calling. Gentlemen.
Hello. Hello. Gentlemen, lads. Netherlands is failed. Ooh.
We did not succeed at the Dutch challenge. But we still have the country.
It is still on the board for— Yes, yes, for now.
Certainly for now. Thank you...
Anyway. for this very interesting
update, gentlemen. Very interesting update.
Good bye. Good bye, Sam.
Good bye Tom. Well, unsurprisingly,
they looked delighted. The die is cast.
They're gonna go for it. They're absolutely
gonna go for it. Ohh, baby! That could dictate
how we play tomorrow. ♪ Bee-bop-bop ba-dap-bop ♪ Actually, my
immediate thought is we shouldn't try to deal
with the Netherlands 'cause it's gonna be annoying
to get there from where we are. And now that they've failed it,
they can never reattempt. So for the next five days,
the Netherlands is sitting there waiting to be stolen. And I think that if there's a day where we don't have
another good option, there are frequent
flights to Amsterdam, and we just go and we grab it. That's my take.
No, I agree. We don't need to
steal it right away. We do want to try and
steal it eventually, but... the map is still very open. Right, and I
really want to make sure we get Austria
before they get there. I will say that we're
on Deutsche Bahn now, which would explain
why this train is late. And why there
are random explosions. Yeah. Our train comes in three minutes.
Okay. Good luck. Should we get a train? Let's get the train. (laughs gleefully) Alright. Check the platform. Oh, yeah, which platform?
We need to go to... Don't tell me
it's the Aachen one. Oh, it's gonna be the Aachen one.
Oh no. It's gonna be the—
Oh no! It is the Aachen one. Cancelled due to
limited rolling stock. Well, how else are we
getting to Aachen in time? The next one's cancelled as well. Wait, wait, wait. Do we... Wait, we have time to get
on a train to Brussels. Then get on a train to Brussels. But then we'll have to... We'll have to spend a (bleep)-load
to get that flight to Vienna. I'm sorry.
We have to go to Brussels. It's the only option.
I guess. It's literally the only option.
It's the next one too. Yeah, where...? I think it's the Liège one.
Let me double check. I'm not even certain that the connections will
work right, but I'll... Well, can you see
any other way to go? No, I mean,
Liège is the right answer, 'cause then we're on
a high-speed line. Yeah. There's our train on the left. Back the way we came then?
I suppose. I need to research whether
there is a connection. Well, what if there isn't? (sputters) Cool! Cool, cool, cool. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus I wanna start out
by saying —Can we curse in ad reads? Yes, I think we can. (bleep) Deutsche Bahn. Whoa.
Whoa. I love trains, but oof. But you know what else
I wanna say? I'm always saying this. That you could watch

I was gonna say it. I love— I just said
I love saying it and then you just stole... I was trying to show
that I'm listening to you. Yeah, but now I can't...

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","5UAM-ZKBcZs","Hello and welcome
to the finale of our six-day game of
hide-and-seek across Japan. As a final reminder, in this game,
the Hider is given three and a half hours
to get to a hiding place, starting from where
the previous Hider was found. Then it's up to the Seekers
to find the Hider as quickly as possible by asking questions
from the question menu. In exchange for truthful answers, the Hider gets to draw
advantages from the Hider deck. After five days of gameplay,
Ben sits in a commanding first place with a time of
13 hours and 9 minutes, with Adam in second at
11 hours, 21 minutes. Those won't be easy times to beat,
but at the start of my run, something happened that
could change everything. After Ben and Adam's first question,
about what region I was in, I pulled the Move card, the single most powerful
card in the deck, which allows me to spend one hour
traveling to a new hiding spot at any point before the endgame. No other player has
pulled this card so far, meaning no one has any experience
dealing with its implications. So without further ado, the finale of
hide-and-seek across Japan. (chuckles) So I do have a Move card. And a Move card... That's influential.
I'm absolutely keeping this. That is a really valuable card. I mean, I remember when we
were designing this game, we were really going back and forth
on whether we wanted to include it, just because it's...
of its potential power, you know? I can't play this once they're here, but if I see them
coming towards here... I could really waste
a lot of their time, I think, by going somewhere
completely different. This, honestly,
the more I think about it... the more I think that
by the end of this day, this card could be the thing
that wins me the game. Here's the deal.
We need to find Sam today. Yeah.
Or our goose... Or geese, I should say.
Yeah, they will be cooked. If Sam wins, then he
will go into the lead in his all-time
Jet Lag win record. Yes, and we cannot
allow that to happen. If you win, then
I think we're all tied. If you can believe it.
Wouldn't that be so nice. Wouldn't that be pretty fun. Ben, I have what
I would say is good news. He is not in the same region as us. Okay, great. I would say that
this is quite good news and means that we should
proceed on to Tokyo. Because this means
that wherever he is, he went via Tokyo or
the general Tokyo area. Yeah, I'm quite pleased.
I'm feeling pleased. We cannot be fooled.
We are foolproof. We are foolproof. One last look at... Where are we? So, here's the deal. I'm not gonna lie.
I don't love my hiding spot. I'll give Adam credit. He might not have had
a winning run with his spot, but he at least
really forced my hand with some tough geography. Basically, I had three options. I could have gone west,
kind of back to Kōfu, and then explored some of
the rural lines around there. Although, to be honest, the profile of the kind of spot
I would have hidden in would have been
pretty similar to yesterday's but with even fewer options. The other option was, I could come to the
near Shinkansen lines, get as geographically far as I can. And I really considered that.
I looked at a lot of options. However, ultimately,
I just wouldn't have had enough time to actually transfer
onto another line. So pretty much I would have had
to hide on a Shinkansen stop. And I considered that.
I mean, nobody's tried that. However, there were not
that many Shinkansen stops you could even get to, and there were a lot of unique
features of each of them. So, that left me with
the third option. Hiding in the biggest urban area in the entire world. You think he's in...
just the Tokyo metro area? I mean, look, that was sort of the little feeling
I got this morning, is if Sam wants to
try a new strategy... It's true. It could make sense to be like, maybe just being in
the densest possible place is the way to go. I think the unfortunate
thing for him is... we did a pretty good job
of designing the game in such a way that I don't think that
the Tokyo metro area is actually overpowered
in the way you might hope. No, in fact,
we got to Japan early and tested to make sure
that that exact thing was not overpowered. So if he is in Tokyo, we know how to play that game.
Yeah. You know, the more I think
about this Move card... the more I realize that... I might have a bit of
an OP combo here. Because, you know, normally, from most locations that
we've hidden in so far, you know, you're on one train line. And therefore, in 60 minutes,
the number of options of train stations you can get to
is not very many. But again, I'm in the biggest
urban area in the entire world. And therefore,
the number of train stations I can get to in 60 minutes... It's, I mean, well into
the hundreds, I think. I gotta tell you, Ben.
I got some pretty gnarly blisters. Oh yeah, my feet
are (bleep)-ed up. I would say that if you are
playing the home game, I would not necessarily
recommend playing it for six days straight,
11 to 12 hours a day. Yeah, I think just sort of have
a chill, fun time with it instead. Yeah, I mean, you can play it for
six days straight for 11 to 12 hours a day.
I'm not gonna stop you. But I would say that it is gonna
(bleep) your feet up a little bit. Alright, we made it
back to the station. Whee.
We're gonna make this train. Whee! And we're off to Tokyo. Whee! What do you think we want to do
when we get to Tokyo? What do I think we want to do
when we get to Tokyo? I... ...want to go eat some ramen and have... sushi. I think we got time for that.
Could be nice. Oof. Oh, Ben.
Yeah, even just... Yeah, I know, I know.
...ten steps up. I think the thing once we
get to Tokyo is just like... ""Hey man, are
you in Tokyo or no?"" Is he in Tokyo? Look at how
narrow this house is. How do you—
What do you put there? Looks like Ben and
Adam have completed the long walk
down to the station. And I have to imagine they're now gonna
take the train east towards, you know,
Tokyo, towards here. I'm gonna go explore my zone a bit. There's no point in
looking for a hiding spot since I think I'll move... you know, to a different area
before they search, but I mean, might as well keep
my eye out just in case, I don't know, something...
I don't know what would change. I mean, I want to play this card. (gong ringing) You're not in there. You're not in there. I think you have to go...
It's a different place, Adam. It's not on there. Where is that?
I don't even know where that is. Time to get on the train, Ben. Off to Tokyo! Wheee-EEEEEE!
Wheee! So when we get to Tokyo, I think... We just, we hit him
with a big Radar. Radar... 25, 50? You thought we
weren't gonna go to Tokyo and hit you with a big Radar?
Wrong again. Looks like Ben and Adam
are heading towards Tokyo. So they must be waiting to do... I don't know, some
Radar or region thing or something like that
for their second question. I guess they're
playing conservatively. Little do they know... I might have already pulled
the best card in the deck. So, you know. That's helpful. If he's in Tokyo,
we've got the tools to defeat him... handily. Handily. Okay? You thought we couldn't
defeat Sam handily? Wrong again. They keep being
wrong about stuff. They keep making so many
wrong assumptions. I know. It's making
them look pretty stupid. Yeah, well... That's what they get
for underestimating us. God, I hope we finish
this round in three hours. It'd be awesome. Sort of an
anticlimactic finale. Check these out.
It's like, it's carved. Like gourds, I guess? I mean, maybe, or
weirdly shapen pumpkins. Yeah. It's a Christmas pumpkin.
Of course. Hello. Our train has been
delayed for a while here. Yeah, we've been stopped
for 10, maybe 15 minutes. Which is unfortunate,
because there's also not... There aren't really any other trains
we can take out of here. But you know what? We don't need this time.
It's fine. We're just having
a relaxing morning. It doesn't even matter.
It's not even gonna matter. And I'm not even worried.
I'm not even worried. Are you worried?
I'm not even worried. How could I even be worried?
You couldn't. Because there's nothing
to be worried about. (vocal frying) Okay, I've come to McDonald's. To be honest, mostly
just sitting near AC, but I'm gonna try... I'm gonna try this, which apparently is like
shrimp chicken nuggets. And I will give you my review. Yeah. The doors just closed.
Yeah. The doors just— Hey!
Here we go, here we go. (hums faux-Italian ditty) Good stuff. We're on the move again. Hello. Now that we're
getting sort of close to the center of Tokyo,
we figure now might be a good time to start a Thermometer. Little Thermometer,
kinda cut the area in half, east-west wise.
Chop it up, chop it up. Because we happen to be on a line that goes pretty much
exactly west to east. And it's like, look,
as while we're on it, Might as well.
might as well chop it. Because the thing is,
there's so many lines. We're not gonna be able to
figure this out by being like, ""Well, he could have gone this way.
He could have gone—"" We're just going to
have to chop the area up It's why they call us—
into smaller and smaller pieces. It's why they call us
the chopping boys. They call us the chopping boys. 'Cause, on account of
how we love to chop. Alright, our Thermometer
has been played. We've played our
wonderful Thermometer, Ben. I think it's probably
gonna be hotter, but it'll be nice to have
that good clean line. Alright, they've ended
their Thermometer, and it will cut Tokyo
kind of in two. Which is not great,
but honestly, if I saw this, and I was the Seeker,
I might, you know... take the Shinkansen up to Takasaki
and check that area out. We've all been assuming that people will take
the Shinkansen somewhere. And, I think Takasaki
is still in play. I definitely could've gotten there. Ohh! It's colder. That is really
interesting news. This is a very limited area.
One of the bigger chops we've seen. I would say
the bigger the chop... Mhm.
...the happier I am. Yeah, you love a big chop.
Yeah. We're about to get
into Shinjuku Station. Yeah, we should just get off. We're just— I think—
Yeah, we'll just get off here. Alright. Welcome to the busiest
train station in the world. Shinjuku. Alright, let's try
to find somewhere to... ...figure out what this means.
Yeah. Alright, let's pull our cards. One. Two. Ten minute bonus. Discard one, draw two. Well, that's not awesome. I guess I'll keep the
discard one, draw two. Might come in handy later. We'll see. This looks like food. Okay, hello. Because we've done such a good job, we've decided to reward ourselves
with some sushi. Okay, what the heck
do we do next? How do we feel about
a little Radar? I feel relatively good
about a 50 mile Radar. You want to hit it? Let's just do it.
Okay. We're just going
to keep chopping. Hopefully it's a hit. Alright, they've asked
for a 50 mile Radar. That is for sure going to be a hit. It's going to more or less
confirm from them that I'm in an urban area
in or around Tokyo. They're not going to
like that, honestly. I would not be pleased
with Seeking... in the area I am now. If that's a hit, I'd say
we're doing quite well. If it's a miss, I'd say... our next move is gonna matter a lot. I would agree with that. It's a hit. Okay, that's good. It makes our lives
a lot simpler from here. There's a lot of weird possibilities
that we don't have to worry about. What we need to do now
is get a better map. Okay, we're gonna
go work on a little map. And then we're gonna
come back to you with some conclusions.
We're gonna work on a map. I don't have a good
outro for this clip. Let's draw our next card. One. Two. Oh man. Just keep getting these.
Here's what I'll do. I'll keep the discard one, draw two
and then use it as a discard with one of the other
discard one, draw twos. And another two. Five minute bonus and
Curse of the Bridge Troll. Curse of the Bridge Troll. The Seekers must ask
their next question from under a bridge. Casting cost: The Seekers must
be at least 50 miles from you. Curse of the Bridge Troll. Well, I guess they have
to be 50 miles away. Could be better, to be honest. I mean, aside from,
of course, the Move card. That's clutch. You can't do
any cool stuff here. That's true. They really don't want
you to do anything cool. Alright, chopping boys
reporting back in. We've drawn this.
This is the area that we're in. And I think there can be
almost no doubt that we should do
a 25 mile Radar. Which will basically tell us, ""Hey, are you in
all of this really dense ""Tokyo kind of greater metro area, or are you sort of
more out in the weeds?"" And then we get
a tiny little semicircle, which is a nice, good chop,
or we get a little donut. We get a big, sort of
bizarre part of a donut. Yeah. And if we get that, then,
I'm not quite sure what we do, but I know that we'll
figure it out together. Yay! Chopping boys! Alright, another question. It's a 25 mile Radar.
It is a hit. That's gonna really tell
them that I'm in Tokyo. But, that's still
quite a few options. One. And two. These have got to be good, right?
Come on. Oh, we got a randomize.
Randomize is not bad. I'll keep the randomize, for sure. Yeah, no, the randomize
will be good. Okay, yet another report
from the chopping boys. We've got our answer. Ben, it's a hit.
It's a hit, okay. Now, this is some very
interesting information. That means he's
only 25 miles from us. (sniffs) I can smell him. I feel quite good about this. I feel like we've been—
No, I know. No, I do too, I do too. We've been cutting
with great aplomb. I would say we're getting
close to Tentacles territory. I mean, the trouble is,
this is 50 miles across. So I actually think we need
to try to chop this guy again. My opinion is,
let's walk a half mile, either north or south,
ask if we're hotter or colder, and then we go to the center
of whatever area we have left and we do a Tentacles.
That's what I have to say to you. Alright, let's go south.
Alright, fine by me. Rev up that Thermometer. Well, thermometers, which
famously have to be revved up. Rev it up. This is sort of what
thermometers are always doing. We're using a
very old fashioned one. Right, they require engines.
It's gas powered. Oop-a! Alright, they're starting
a half-mile Thermometer. This could be interesting. I wonder which slice
they'll try to... you know, slice off. Beep, beep, beep. ♪ Thermometer ♪ Beep, beep, beep. ♪ Thermometer ♪ That's a cool song.
How does the rest of it go? That's the whole song. Woo!
Woo! Woo!
Woo! Woo!
Yeah. Alright, we're done.
Okay, Thermometer complete. Sam... are you north
or are you south? I am north. They've gone south. So, it's a colder. Do you think
he's north or south? Well, actually, Ben,
I know the answer because he just texted us
that he is north. Okay, well. I don't really have
an opinion on that. I was gonna be fine either way. Let's go back
to Shinjuku Station and then we'll head straight there.
We go to the middle. You freaking Tentacle his ass. And we're gonna
Tentacle his ass. His ass is
gonna get Tentacled. It really doesn't
sound good to say that. No, oh, man.
We really shouldn't. No, no.
We should not say that. Another card pull. One, two. Ten minute bonus. Oh, we can... make them strap
some lemons on. Curse of the Lemon Phylactery. Before asking another question,
the Seekers must each find a lemon and affix it to the outermost
layer of their clothes or skin. Casting cost: Discard a powerup. That's always a fun one. I'd say we just hit it now.
Could be fun. Let's figure it out.
Ben... It's lemon time.
Okay, let's go. When Sam gives you lemons,
you tape them to your body. Yep, that's what they say.
That's the old saying. Here we go.
This is what Sam and I used. Okay, grocery store. It's lemon time. Well, I see limes. Ah, wonderful. In fact, we can get
a lovely little two pack. Whoa! Perfect. And they designed
that for if you're playing hide-and-seek 2.0
with two Seekers. Oh, I should. What? This is that thing
I was telling you about. Ohhh. Lemons acquired. And once we're all
lemoned up, as a reward, we can have our little ice creams.
Yaaay! I'm gonna try to
do this not too tightly. I don't think that
these lemons are falling off. Alright, lemons attached. We're about to head to the middle of the region Sam could be at,
to Tentacle his ass. But really quickly,
we have to make a stop in the Snack Zone. This is one of the
greatest inventions in the history of mankind. Ben, I'd like to submit
my theory right now. Mhm?
Sam is in Kawagoe. Mhm. Kawagoe is called ""Little Edo"" because it has a lot of
really cool Edo architecture. I think that might be where he is. Mmm, mhm. Alright, I've had
enough sitting around. I'm gonna just look around a bit.
See what I can find. Okay, now I've found
some cool stuff. Unfortunately... literally this street
is the limit of my zone. But look how cool the shops are. This is apparently what
this town is more known for. Apparently it was
like a wealthy spot back in the Edo period
or whatever. Oh man, that looks so cool. Alright, looks like
they finally left Shinjuku, and are headed north,
towards me. But, they don't have
enough info, yet, to know it's here. Right? Yeah. Yeah, no. I mean, the main thing I need to do,
considering I have that great card is not (bleep) it up. And make sure I actually leave here
before they get here. So I do have to pay good
attention to the tracker. Alright, Ben. It's the Se-bu-buh... It's the She—
Seibu Shinjuku Line Limited on platform three. It really is stairs.
The stairs are the killer. Not good.
Oh. Hello.
Hello. We are almost to the center
of the remaining map. I think we hit the zoo Tentacles. Yeah, we were looking.
There's a lot of zoos around here. Alright, I'm gonna send them. Yeah, I think if
we've done our work right... then... then this will tell us where he is. Okay, we're pulling into... ...""Torokozawa"". What time does
this train leave, Ben? We need to get off. It's going to leave before we get—
I think we need to get off. We'll wait off the train, and we can hop back
on if we need to. Okay, okay. If this hits, and the zoo is north, we want to get right
back on this train. Yeah. We need an answer,
we need an answer! I have acquired... ...something like a
caramel, I don't know. It looked good. Mmm. Yeah. Okay, bad news.
I've been Tentacled. I am within 15 miles, and one of the zoos
is rather close to me. So that's gonna narrow things down
quite a lot, quite quickly. So, I'm near one of
the train stations. I think I'm actually going to
go to the other train station. Because I think that one
is higher frequency in case I need to
quickly use my Move card. Yeah. This train's
going to leave in... Oh. Okay. Oh, we did get an answer.
Oh, it is a hit. Okay, it's a hit?
It's... Okay, well, we should've
stayed on the train. It's fine, it's fine. There's another one
in a few minutes. Okay, this zoo is up—
it's up by Kawagoe. It's up by Kawagoe,
like I said! I think you might've called it.
Might've called it! Might have called it!
This train is going now. Might have called it! I almost forgot
to do my card pull. It's a beefy one.
I get to pull four, pick two. One, two, three, four. Oh, five minutes, ten minutes.
Zoologist. Curse of the Zoologist. Take a photo of a wild fish, bird,
mammal, reptile, amphibian, or bug. The Seekers must take a
picture of a wild animal in the same category
before asking another question. Urban Explorer. Curse of the Urban Explorer. For the rest of your run,
Seekers cannot ask questions when they are on transport
or in a transit station. Casting cost: Discard two cards. I think I'll keep
the two Curses. I think I'll play the Urban Explorer while discarding the Zoologist
and the five minute bonus. That'll slow them down for sure. We're getting on this train. We have just been hit with a Curse.
Okay. For the rest of your run,
Seekers cannot ask questions when they are on transit
or in a transit station. Hmm, that's not a great
Curse for him to pull now. No. Would've been good
for him to pull earlier. No, and he had to discard
two cards to play that, too. Yeah, I think he knows
he's in twubble. So, I guess we're— I was gonna just say we
should ask for a photo, but... Let's just go there.
Let's just go there and then we'll figure
it out from there. Alright, they're definitely
on the train that terminates here. If they don't get off in
the next couple of minutes, I'm gonna have to play this card. I don't have an option, I think, because I cannot risk
playing it too late once they've gotten within my zone,
because then it's invalid. So probably in about
the next five minutes, I need to decide
whether I'm playing it. Guess we'll see him in Kawagoe.
Kawagoe. I may have called it. I feel like I may have
kind of called it. I would say that
at the very least we're close enough now that it would be fair
to say you called it. Whee. I love having called it. Well done. I think we've got him.
I think we've got him. Alright, time to go.
They passed it. We gotta go. Move. Discard your hand
and send the Hiders the location of your
transit station. This card grants the
player 60 minutes to establish a new hiding zone
somewhere else on the game map. The Seekers are frozen,
and your hiding timer is paused until this new hiding
period has concluded. This card cannot be
played during the endgame. Oh boy, I'm glad
I had this card. Alright, welcome to Kawagoe. So we need to leave
the station to ask a question. I think what we do is leave here
and ask for tallest building. Because I also think
there's a good chance this is where he is, and then he will say
he can't answer, and then that'll confirm
we're in the endgame. Right, right, right. Where is the exit? This seems to be a mall. Okay, interesting. Oh... Adam, Adam.
Yeah, yeah? What? I, uh... Ben, what? No.
Mhm. He pulled the one Move. No.
He pulled the one Move. No, he didn't.
Okay, wait, wait, wait, okay. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So that means... He's on the move. I don't know where I'm going. I'm just kind of vibing
it out at this point. We'll see where I get off.
I'll just do it on feel, I guess. Oh, Jesus, okay. This is sort of the only thing
that could have gone wrong. We have to figure out where
he could be going right now. Wait, wait, wait. He has to
send us what his station... It was this station. This was his station.
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, we are stuck
for an hour while he moves. This hour does not count
towards his time. (bleep) (bleep) We had him. I know. He was here. We got him.
Okay. This was going to be
the fastest catch of the game. Okay, let's go sit down. Let's go sit down. Okay, we need
to start researching how far he can get in an hour. Starting at 2 pm.
Yeah. I don't think he could
have gotten that far. No, that's true. Well, I mean,
he could have gotten— He's moving right now. Okay, okay.
So we also— Here's the other question
we have to ask ourselves. What's the most annoying
possible line he could get on? Because that's the one
he'll try to get on. You know what I mean? Yeah. (grunting) We have time, we have time.
It's gonna be okay. We're gonna get it sorted out. Son of a (bleep) We had him. We literally had him.
That's crazy. It's crazy how much we had him. Okay, I think we're
gonna go for the next stop. I'm just not sure, I don't know. Just 'cause. Okay, I am... here. To be honest, I didn't really...
go anywhere with purpose. I just got on the first train I saw
and got off on a random stop, because, chaos theory, right? If I don't know where I'm going,
how will they know where I'm going? The trouble is, we've already
used a lot of our good questions. We've used our
half mile Thermometer. What if we asked about
his proximity to a major airport? Yeah?
That would tell us, did he go up
or did he go down? Right, because
all of those airports, like Haneda and Narita,
are pretty just clearly that way. Yeah. Alright, it's 2:59. Right when it hits 3,
we're gonna ask our question. 10 seconds.
Alright. Mm-kay, let's go. (deflates) Are you closer to or further
from your nearest major airport? So, they're asking basically, am I further from
my closest major airport? So that should give
them some direction. Let me check, I don't actually know. Sam, we are not gonna
let this give you the win. He's closer.
Okay, that means he went in. Okay.
Okay. Now I'm going to ask
if he's closer to or further from a major city center. But we can't do that in here. Right, right.
Okay, let's get out of here. Okay.
Where is the exit? I literally don't know. It's gotta be through
this stupid mall, right? Okay, let's go
through this stupid mall. Three cards. One. Curse of the
Mediocre Travel Agent. Choose any publicly accessible place within a half mile of the
Seekers' current location. They must go there, spend
at least ten minutes there, and acquire a souvenir before
asking another question. Casting cost:
Their vacation destination must be further from you
than their current location. Two. Curse of the Jammed Door. For the next three hours,
the Seekers must roll dice to pass through a doorway. Casting cost: Discard a card. Three. Curse of the Drained Brain. Choose three questions
in different categories. The Seekers cannot
ask those questions for the rest of your run. Casting cost: Discard your hand. Those are good ones. I think I gotta keep the
jammed door one, right? Problem is I can't play it yet
because I don't have another card I could discard with it. Okay, now that we are
out of the station again, we're asking if he is closer to
or further from a major city. Hopefully he's closer. Because then that gives us
small areas that we can deal with. Oh my god, oh, we...
I know. We would've had him by now.
I know, I know, I know. Okay, already hit me
with another one. Am I closer or further
from nearest major city? Another card pull. And one, two, three. Veto's pretty valuable.
I'm gonna keep Veto, yeah, for sure. He's closer, that's good.
That's good. That's really good.
Okay. So the Tokyo area is weird. It has four things
that qualify as cities: Tokyo, Kawasaki,
Yokohama, and Saitama. The good news is that Tokyo,
Yokohama, and Kawasaki are all sort of clumped together. Saitama is sort of up by itself.
So what I think we should do is sort of go roughly to
the center of Saitama and Tentacle there,
and if it's a miss, then we know he's in the
sort of big super group down by Yokohama,
Kawasaki, and Tokyo. Alright, gonna
explore my new zone. Let's see what we got. It's nice, it's quieter
than where I was. Okay, we got some park
action up in here. Let's check out the park. We got a little lake. It's very peaceful in here. I'm gonna get some ice cream. Oh, legs. Oh (bleep) Damn you, Sam. You okay?
Yes. We're getting on this,
we're going to Ōmiya, so that we can check the first bubble around Saitama. Oh, the stairs.
Yeah, the stairs. This was all part of his plan. Alright, Ben,
I'm ready to send it the second we step out.
Alright. Alright, hit him. And boom. Amusement park Tentacles. Alright, I've been Tentacled. Draw four, pick two. One, two, three, four. Ugh, okay. I guess I'll just keep the
15 and 20 minute bonuses. Those are not bad. Not the greatest pull,
but that's alright. Ben, it's a hit.
It's a hit? Okay, okay, good stuff, man. Okay, he's closest
to the one near us. That's good.
That's good to know. Okay, just give me a sec here.
Yep. So this is a
pretty limited area, but not as limited as
I would have quite liked. No. We need to find a way
to cut this down more. I'm wondering if there's
anything else we can ask? Distance from coastline? I guess that would
just pretty directly tell us if he was south.
Cut this in half. I like that,
distance from coastline? Yeah. New question.
Distance to coastline. One, two... Three. Veto, ten minute bonus,
Curse of the Census Taker. Curse of the Census Taker. The Seekers must immediately
visit a town or city hall within a mile of their
current location. When there, they must
estimate the population under that town hall's jurisdiction and get the answer
correct within 25%. Otherwise, you are awarded
an extra 30 minutes. Casting cost: The Seekers'
next question is free. As far as I can tell, I can't see a city hall
near their station, so I think I'm just going
to take the 10 minute bonus, 'cause I already have another veto. Closer. Okay, Sam's
closer to the coast. So that cuts off,
I think, more lines. He's gotta be
somewhere in here. Yeah.
That's not a very big area. You want a picture of
the tallest thing he can see and get on a train south?
Yeah, I think... I think that we want to be
able to start working on that. Because I also think there's
a good chance that as we go, we might be able to
just pick it out. And we're going to
want those pictures before the sun sets. Alright. We got it, buddy. Alright, gotta go
back to the station. They're asking for a photo
of the tallest thing. I would not be surprised if they're
just gonna try to ride the line and see if they spot it. Ah, this isn't looking good. There's a pretty, pretty
unique looking building that looks like it
might be the tallest. Adam, I think this is the
mascot of Ōmiya or something. Whoa! Hai, konnichiwa! Okay.
Did you get it on camera? Oh, yeah.
That's awesome! We get on the JK line.
Alright. There's nothing JK
about this, though. We ain't kidding around. Boy, just to tell you
how fried my brain is... I went to check the time to see
when this train was gonna be here, and I checked my lemon. Yeah, this is not looking good. They're definitely gonna be able
to identify that from the train. Okay, well, here's the station exit. That building is
definitely the tallest. So, I'll send that along. Alright, let's go.
It's pretty distinct. Well, we'll watch for it.
See if maybe we can match it. Okay, wait,
no, I don't think so. No, no. No, I don't think it
could be any of these. Oh wait, no, no.
But that looks similar again. It's something like that. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, what's that? You see that? No, that's not it. Minor update.
They took the wrong line. It's gonna be a little bit longer. No, but it's close.
Yeah, it's somewhere. Okay, let's get off. Let's get the hell out of here. Alright. I think a distance from
nearest Shinkansen is good. I think it... clears that line in a way that is pretty convenient. Yeah, I think so. Okay. Another question. Am I closer or further
to a Shinkansen? I am basically right on top
of a Shinkansen line. It goes right through my station,
so I'm definitely closer. Sam is closer.
Closer. Okay. Okay, so that means
he's basically right on the Shinkansen line.
Yeah, okay. We've got it down to
really just these stations. Yeah. So it's one of these. There's a train in five minutes to Musashi-Urawa.
Yeah, let's get on it. I'll say it's starting
to get a little bit late. The sun is going down.
It's... I think we're still okay. But I am starting to get worried. We only have about
45 minutes before the sun sets. Yeah, and also doing it in... a dense, such a city area,
is going to be really hard. Yeah.
There are way more streets. Yep. The thing that
dense metro areas are best at is the endgame.
Yep. Another three card pulls. Two, three.
Curse of the Bird Guide. Curse of the Bird Guide. You have one chance to film a bird
for as long as possible, up to 15 minutes straight. If at any point the
bird leaves the frame, your timer is stopped. The Seekers must then film a bird for the same amount
of time or longer before asking another question. 15 minute bonus.
Discard two, draw three. You know, I think I'll take
the discard two, draw three, and see if I can optimize my
time bonuses at this point. Alright, one, two, three. 10 minute bonus, 10 minute bonus, 15 minute— wow,
that worked out well. Alright, so I have
15, 25, 35, 50, 70, 80. 80 minutes of time bonuses.
Not bad. Yeah, I don't
think that it's here. Train in five minutes
to Nishi-Urawa. You wanna just go? Yeah, I think, let's
just keep riding the line and checking before
we ask any more questions. Adam, I think I see it.
You think you see it? I think I might have seen it.
Where? Over there.
I can't quite see it anymore. That would mean that it
would be not on this tra— That's gotta be it.
That's gotta be it. Yeah, I saw it too. Over there. So we're gonna need
to go up one station. It's gotta be it, right there. Right there.
I think that's it, yeah. Okay, so we'll connect up. Do you know where that is? Yeah, yeah, I do. It's Naka-Urawa. Sumimasen. Okay, so we need to go back. Yeah, this is us. Sam, I think we
might just finally, finally have you. Yeah.
That's the one for sure. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's it. Alright, this is us off here,
and then connect up one and stop. Let's kick it. Here, here, it's over here. That's it. We gotta get out of the station
before we can ask a question. Final endgame of the game.
Let's hope... ...we can make it a quick one. Okay, what do you think?
You want to do a one mile Tentacle? Yeah, what do you—
What kind of Tentacle? Here, you take this.
I'll figure it out. Hospital's gonna give us
the best directionality. Four. Is it worth the cards? Uhm... In my opinion, yeah.
Okay. God, I wish I
hadn't lost my glasses. Do you, because
you kind of have a similar prescription as me.
Put on my sunglasses. Plus you look so cool. Show the audience
how cool you look. You look like a bug. Lemons—
He's responded. Hayashi. Okay, so we want to head up... Wait, really quickly, ask for a photo of the
tallest thing he can see before he can Curse us.
Just in case. Okay. We've sent tallest thing he can see,
and he didn't Curse us, so this should be
enough to find him. Alright, let's start
heading towards that hospital. Okay. There's a park, Ben. Maybe we should start
by checking the park. Okay, start heading
towards the park. Sam, are you in the park?
Please just be in the park. I'm only going to put these on
when I need to be searching closely. Because while they do
make me see better, they also make things darker.
Yeah. It's some random
(bleep)-ing building. So it doesn't seem
like he's in the park. Okay. I mean, this building
is just like a house. Yeah. It's quite generic. But also, if that's the
tallest thing he can see, that actually does
narrow things down a bit. I guess, yeah, because it's like, from here I can see that,
and that's taller. Right. So it can't be anywhere
that you can see that. Can't be anywhere you can see that. I think with
tallest thing stre— Is that it? Is that the tallest building? It does look a lot
like the right house. Agh, it might not quite be right. But it looks really similar,
doesn't it? It does. I just scared a man.
That was a normal man. That was a normal...
I just scared a poor man. Normal man. Not Sam.
Sam's not a normal man. No. I don't think it is this.
But almost! It's very similar. But I suppose it makes sense
that there are several houses that have that kind
of look out here. Should we ask something else?
We still don't have a... Yeah, yeah. Photo of you?
Yeah, photo of him. Get a photo of him. Does not seem like
we should be walking here. No. It's not that, is it? The back of that house?
I don't think so. Again, it's a similar building.
No. It's very similar. He's under something. He's under a bridge. Okay, we should
be able to find that. Under what bridge
can you see a house? Well, there's
a bridge over there. Oh? No, it's not this bridge. Not this bridge. Ugh, I hate
endgames in dense areas. Yeah, there's a lot to look at. What is he under? Okay, let's... (bleep) Let's go this way
and then turn left. I think it'd be close
for it to count, but there's definitely a bridge
there by the station. Let's look at the bridges
near, I mean... Let's go to the river. There are definitely
bridges on the river. And where there are bridges,
there may be Sam. Okay. There's actually a smaller river
that I think might be a better fit. Just one street over.
Right. We just need to cross. (whispering)
I think they're almost here. Oh yeah, look at this...
Look at this little river. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Sam, are you under there? Let's walk alongside
this river, maybe. Saa-aam? But none of the houses match.
(mouthing) They're up there. But, I think it's worth a shot. I certainly think it
could be this river. It's like, he would barely even... He would really
barely be hit by a... Oh no, but I guess he would be. Hi.
Oh, there he is! Hi. Wait, turn the flash on.
You can't see him. There he is. Hi. Hey, Sam.
How's it going? That was really annoying
when you moved. Oh, man!
Yeah? Ohh! Sorry, fellas. I think that it's time for
us to go back to Tokyo Station. Yeah.
For something very important. We've taken so many trains. This time I think we
should do the teleporter. You ready? That was an option
the whole time? One, two, three! Whoa! Whoa!
We're back at Tokyo Station! We made it back safe and sound. Ben, as the person
with the longest hiding time. Yes. Of 13 hours and
nine minutes, I think... Mhm.
Pretty long. Mhm. We can now congratulate you on being the winner
of Jet Lag season 12! Woo! Thank you. I'm so excited. I think that this means
that we are all tied for wins. That is true. I think we're
all tied at five? This really raises
the stakes for next season. It's true, it does. Ben, I did have a feeling
this would happen, because I believe in you so much. When Adam and I were
on a run earlier... Yeah? We saw, it was actually
a crazy coincidence. They had a machine
that was, said, ""Jet Lag season 12
trophy gacha."" That's true, we can cut
to that footage. Yeah, I mean,
I'm not making this up. Perfect.
Yeah. Whoa, they really have
everything in this country. They really do.
It's amazing. Whoa, this is amazing.
Open it up! Wooaaaah!
Woooaah! Oh my god— How did
they fit that in there? I can't believe
that's only 500 yen. Yeah, that's— The yen
is really weak right now. It is not doing well. Oh my god,
that is a lot of metal. So, Ben, it's been six days. You've been on so many trains.
That's true. A really long
plane ride before that. And I guess we both want to know... How are you feeling? I mean... I don't know,
I'm feeling pretty good. I guess there's this one thing.
What is it, Ben? I'm feeling pretty jet lagged! Woooaaaah!
Waaaooh! Hope you enjoy
playing Hide+Seek...? If you are, I guess. And we'll see you
in season 13! Woo! Man, we're making
a lot of seasons. Too many. Oh my god. Okay, bye! (smooches) This is... Here, you go stand... (indistinct cross-talk) Ah, that's actually not so bad. Come closer. Yeah, right there. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Thank you so much
for watching this entire season of Jet Lag Hide+Seek.
We really appreciate it. And we have something
very special to yap about. I would— I'd say so. We are really excited
about this. We've sort of— We've talked
about this throughout the season. But we have taken
our hide-and-seek format, and we have adapted it
so that it can be played theoretically anywhere in the world. Wherever you live,
you can get our hide-and-seek game, and you can organize
a game with your friends, and you can play hide-and-seek. And Ben, tell them about
all the stuff that is in the box. Ten minute bonus. That's true, but there's
more than just that. We don't have time to
go through all the cards. Okay, you get the deck.
You get some dice. You get a cool question sheet
where you can see all the questions and you can record all the answers like you're doing
a little investigation. Got a big ol' rule book that goes through
every possible little detail. It is— There's a lot
of stuff in there. We really can't emphasize
how much work we put into this. Yeah, and I feel like you might
think that we just, I don't know, put the Jet Lag game on
something that other people— No, literally, we wrote and
we went into Google Docs, we wrote words,
and we edited those words. Whole long ruleset. And also we—
And we put it in a rules thing. And we playtested it, and we—
This is truly home— homegrown, homemade.
Yes. And we have not
ever done this before, despite a lot of people asking, because we didn't think
we had a good enough game ...until now. Yeah, this was the first game
where we finally felt like it could be played anywhere. It was not super easy
to make that possible, but I think that we did do it.
It comes in three versions. You can play the big-scale,
country-wide version, like the version that
we play on the show. You can play the
medium-scale version. That's what you would
play in a major city, like New York City or like Paris
or in more of a regional area. And then we have a smaller version
for you to play in a smaller area. I think it will be fun.
And here's what I'll say. I want to see videos
of people playing. Oh, yeah, that'd be fun. Yeah, literally
make your own Jet Lag using the game and
make a whole video of it and I will totally watch it. And I'm really excited to see what this— what
hide-and-seek looks like in all these different
places all over the world. And I'm sure that you guys will be able to share
with each other, like, ""Here's what my map for
Philadelphia looks like"" or Paris, or...
the entirety of Europe. I'm sure that we'll see
some really cool stuff, and I'm just so excited. I feel— It feels
like a new chapter in the Jet Lag: The Game universe. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, that's your
off-season activity this time. It's in the Nebula store. I'm sure there's a link here.
Go to this link. And, yeah, I would... I... Will you check it out?
I really just think that we... We really tried hard to
make this something worth buying. Yeah. We put off selling a game
despite people asking us to for many years
until we felt like we could do it in a way where it would be
something really good that we could stand behind,
and I feel like we did that. And so I really—
I hope that people check it out. We coulda shaken
you suckers down for cash a long time ago.
Yeah.  Yeah. But we didn't do it. Anyway, go check it out and thank you if you do.
Yeah, thank you. And thanks for watching
the season, too. I mean, that's a
long commitment in itself. Yeah, we'll see ya next time.
Bye!"

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","uGI0tkmyogU","(water surging) Hello! Welcome to my new hiding zone! Things are going to
be better this time. Maybe. Welcome to episode 6 of our six-day game of
hide-and-seek across Japan. As a reminder, in this game, the Seekers will attempt
to find the Hider as quickly as possible by asking questions from
our giant question menu. The Hider must answer
these questions truthfully, but in exchange, they'll get to
draw cards from the Hider deck, which give them
advantages in the game. Last episode, after quite
a lot of difficulty, Adam and I found Ben hiding
at Izu-Kōgen Station. Our long search, plus Ben's
impressive hand of time bonuses, put him in a commanding first place with a time of
13 hours and 9 minutes. Last night, Adam had
three and a half hours to get from Ben's final location
to a hiding place. Given that it's day five out of six, this will be Adam's
last chance at hiding. So he'll have to hope he's
chosen a spot tricky enough to throw Ben and me
way off his trail. Alright, Ben.
7:30. We're back.
Okay, let's go get Adam. It's 7:30. There's a train that's
leaving the station really soon, so we gotta boogie. Yeah, I mean,
that would operate under the assumption
that we want to go north, but it would be a wild call for him to go south.
Look, it would be a big brain move for him
to have gone south. But I honestly think that,
if he did that, we're fine. Here's one thing I'll say, Sam. I think we're playing
on ultra hard mode. Adam wants this win bad,
and this is his last chance. Yeah, he's gonna go to
the most annoying location, most difficult location. Oh, Jesus. (water rushing) Alright, so here's the deal. I was planning on hiding somewhere in the greater
metro area of a city. Probably Nagoya. But the more I thought about it, the more I just kept feeling like it was gonna be a huge mistake. Because cities are hubs. Cities are the place that you go
when you just need to move somewhere and then maybe you decide
where to go next. So like if I had hid in Nagoya,
it would have been pretty easy to figure out I was
in that direction. And then they probably
would've just headed basically to Nagoya
to decide their next move, and then they would have
realized I was there. This is basically
what happened to Sam in season 1 of hide-and-seek
when he hid in Winterthur. We went there almost immediately. See, I figure at this point... I need them to really screw up
in order for me to win, right? We screwed up bad against Ben. If I'm gonna have any shot,
I need to be in a place that has the potential
to mess them up that bad. And that's why I chose here. Now look, there are certain
questions they could ask me that would put me in
some real trouble. But, with the right
mix of questions, this is a place that I think
could really throw them off. Will it work? We will certainly find out. If we don't catch him
by the end of today, if we don't catch him by 7:30...
That's that. I don't even have
a shot of a winning run. Yeah. Just based on
our end time, so... Well, I'm also motivated
to catch him today, because if we don't catch him today,
I think I'm toast, too. Yeah, I mean, basically,
we're in the same boat. Alright, back at the station. What do you think
that little tower is for? I was wondering about that. I don't know, but I'm
kind of wondering what this... decorative rock is about. Oh yeah, it seems to be
a thing that people pull. Oh, why? I don't know.
Oh. Alright.
Just made it. So we should
investigate questions. Actually, Ben, what could
be useful is maybe... nearest Shinkansen. I was looking at that. Asking if he's near
the Tōkaidō Shinkansen, it would pretty clearly
give us a direction, right? It would... I think if it was a hint,
it would imply going west. Theoretically, there's
a little bit more east, but I don't think that
would make much sense. Right. Yeah, I think that's not a bad one.
Yeah. I mean, won't 100%
give us direction. I mean, it could, but... I think that's
a good thing to know. Yeah, I know.
It'll exclude a lot of territory. We can ask that now.
Yeah. You wanna ask that now?
I'd say hit it. Alright, real quick, before they ask me
my first question. I also want to show you
this bridge. There's this really
cool bridge here. See? Cool bridge. Pretty cool bridge, huh? Pretty neat. Alright, first question. They have asked if
my nearest Shinkansen is the same as theirs. Okay, this is actually a question
I was hoping that they would ask. This sort of maybe
helps play into my plan. Let's do our three cards. Five minute bonus. Ten minute bonus.
Fifteen minute bonus. Okay. I guess that's fine. I guess we'll take the 15. Alright. Let's move into town. Okay, his nearest
Shinkansen is the same. That's very useful. That narrows things down a lot.
It does. It means that we probably
want to go towards Nagoya. I think so. I mean, a big question
is just going to be how far down that line
we want to travel. And so, a big Radar
could make sense soon? It could, yeah. I mean, is there any
chance we want to... get a photo while we're waiting? I really feel like
we're underusing photos, because they're so cheap.
You love your photos. Well, yeah, but
they've been the thing that has confirmed—
I know, I know, you're cracked. You're cracked with the photos.
GeoGuessr pro, Sam. It's just like, there's
so much potential spillover info. Here's what I'll say.
If we ask him for the picture of the tallest thing from
the train station, he's gonna get super exacerbated. No, exasperated. That's roughly right, I think. Because that's
what got him last time. He might freak out.
It's true. I feel like psychological warfare
is an important part of this game. I mean, it is easy
to make Adam freak out, and that does throw
him off his game. I think that he might be like, ""Oh my god, they're
going to figure me out."" I think we're going to want
tallest building at some point. I think it's
a good one to have. Why don't we just do it now?
Maybe there's extra in the front. Let's get it. Okay, well... This is not... really what we hoped for. So this is a question I really
did not want to get asked. It's really lame that
I got asked it so soon. We happen to be at
the train station right now. What is the tallest
building I can see? I think it's that. Let's try to get as close
to that as possible... so that we can send a
picture of it, without... showing that we're
in the mountains. Ugh, I don't like how
distinctive that building is. I don't like that. I do not! Sam, Two-Minute Connection
is my middle name. Because my parents thought
that would be cool. The police were called because they thought it was
child endangerment. Interesting, okay. Sam, I think
we're gonna make it. That's it. Sam, look at the beach. Should we steal Adam's line? What's Adam's line?
Let's go to the beach, beach. Let's go get away. They... hey... He knows more of it than me. I think you did
pretty good, Sam. Thank you. Yeah, there it is. Okay. Oh yeah. Yeah, that's good. Real quick, let's draw our card. Awesome. Awesome, no, that's really good. No, that's actually great
that we got a five minute bonus. No, that's actually— that rules. Now let's see if
we can get breakfast without getting bothered again. Ah, man. So what I'm really happy with,
in terms of that photo, is that I don't think
you can tell at all that that's in the mountains, or that this place has
areas that are really small. I think that reads as suburban, major city. So hopefully it's actually
actively unhelpful for them. We've got mail.
We've got mail. Is it a picture?
Is it a picture? It's a fairly generic...
I mean, that implies to me like... It's got an antenna. Yeah, I mean that
looks like a lot of just... not like center of city,
but kind of like... Basically I don't think
he's on city streets. And I also don't see any... Well, maybe it would
be hard to tell. I don't really see
any mountains or anything. At least means he's not here. Makes me think that
he is at least decently far. But this sort of further
encourages my theory that I think we should do
a 100 mile Radar. Because I think with
a 100 mile Radar, we'll be able to cut off
basically everything except for the stuff that
he could have gotten to by going to Nagoya or further. And so if it's a miss, then we would know to
go straight to Nagoya. Yeah. Send it? I think send it.
Let's do it. Okay, they've requested
a 100 mile Radar. I actually don't even know... if I am or not. Oh, huh. I actually would argue
that's pretty bad news. I would actually argue
that is not so good. Uuugggh. Alright, Ben. We got an answer. What do you think it is?
I think it's a miss. Well, it's a hit.
Ohhh. That is really interesting.
Oh, okay. It's very, very interesting. Okay, Mr. Adam Chase. I feel like it narrows
the map down a lot, but I am now... Yeah, I do not know what
our next move is gonna be. Sorry, I know this is an
intense gameplay moment, but I keep seeing
cool stuff out the window. It's okay, we're getting both. Look at that.
And then back to Sam. And then back to that.
And back to Sam. Sam, what do we do?
I can see the map. Let's draw our cards. One. Fifteen minute bonus,
not terrible. Two. Five minute bonus,
pretty bad. Oh wow, tough decision.
Oh man, which one do I go with? Alright, let's go find breakfast. Welcome to Atami. This right here?
It's a great dice throwing course. Oh, is that where you did it?
This thing, yeah. You gotta watch out for the cars.
Sure. They're trying to kill you.
But aside from that. So, one thing I'm keeping in mind is the Kawaguchiko area
would be a likely candidate. I mean, I'm almost tempted to ask for tallest mountain. Just to see if it's Mt. Fuji? Because there is a lot
of zone around here where you would see Mt. Fuji. It's true.
And it's cheap. And mountains
told us a lot yesterday. Yeah, tallest mountain,
on the off chance that the tallest mountain
he can see is Mt. Fuji is kind of fun. Well look, those
take a little while. We still have to sort of figure out
what our next main move is. So I think, let's ask for
the mountain photo for now. Even just for fun.
Yeah. Alright, let's do it.
Yeah, why not? Oh, come on. Not only is that one
of the worst questions they could have asked me... I just want to eat my breakfast! (sighs) Okay. What do we reckon
the tallest mountain is? It's gotta be that one, right? Yeah, gotta be that one. Okay. I was kind of hoping that
we would be five or six hours in when they knew I was
in the mountains. Not so much that we would be
an hour and a half in. That was less what I was hoping,
to be honest with you, audience. (groans loudly) We took a risk with our hiding spot.
We knew it was a risk. We knew it was a risk.
We knew this. So far, the risk isn't paying off.
But here's the thing. I have a tendency, I know, to kind of vacillate between ""it's so over"" and
""we're so back."" And right now, it kinda
feels like it's so over. Because they know
I'm within 100 miles, they know that I'm closest
to the Tōhoku Shinkansen. And they now know that
I am in the mountains. But maybe soon
we'll be so back. The key at this point is we
need them to make a mistake. We need them to (bleep) up. It's pretty much the deal
as far as I can tell. I am finally going
to eat my noodles. Okay, now we need to discuss how to exclude Tokyo. Basically, the greater Tokyo area.
Right. We are one stop away from
the next prefecture over. Well, yeah,
and so that prefecture is in the same region as Tokyo. So if we went to there,
we could ask about region, and that would...
check all of Tokyo. It's so definitive.
It's so definitive, and... We are in a unique situation where we are right
on the region border. Yeah. I think we should do that.
Yeah. Alright, let's go find
the train up to... Platform 5.
Up to that region. Oh boy. Sam, we got our photo.
Oh. We got our mountain photo. That is tall. It is tall.
It is not Mt. Fuji. It's not Mt. Fuji,
but I also would say that... Can you see mountains
like that from Tokyo? No.
I don't think so. The fact that this is pointy. Yeah, that's like a
mountain mountain. I do think that we still want to go and check and see if he's in the Kantō region.
I agree. We just, we gotta
eliminate that possibility. It's worth it.
But then after that, I think we gotta start
looking towards the mountains. But that does make me think
that he's maybe gone up to Iida or Kōfu or somewhere
on one of those lines. This is our train.
I mean... The line to  Kōfu, it fits a lot. Not only is it mountainous,
but these mountains, look, they block your view
to Mt. Fuji super well. So I think that that's
a pretty good theory. But, we're off to go
check the Kantō region. Okay, real quick, we need to draw
our card for our photo. Curse of the Hidden
Hangman, not bad. Curse of the Hidden Hangman. Before asking another question or boarding another
form of transportation, Seekers must beat the
hider in a game of hangman. Casting cost: Discard two cards. Okay. Come on. Go the wrong way.
Go the wrong way. Go the wrong way. This chair leans back so far.
I feel like I'm gonna fall asleep. (indistinct) (indistinct) Alright, well, welcome to... Where are we?
We're in the right region. We're in the Kantō region. Should we ask that question?
Yeah, let's hit it. Let's hit the question. Eugh, same region. Oh, that's not what you
were supposed to ask. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let's check. Okay. This could be
that we're so back. This could be that we're so back.
I would argue that this... has the potential to
throw them off a bit. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Not a match. Okay, so, he is
not in the Kantō region. Which is what we expected,
but it's good. It's getting Tokyo out of your brain and
all of those lines. Yeah. It's a relief. So now, we can focus up.
He's in the mountains. Alright, let's draw
our cards real quick. Alright. One. Five minute bonus. Great. Two. F—Are you kidding me? If this is not a good card... You know what, it's fine! It's fine because
Curse of the Hidden Hangman requires you to discard two. And now I have two useless cards
that I can discard with it. So it's actually fine. It's fine. I know I'm crazy... (cracks up) ...but Strava map? You think already?
We're gonna want it eventually. And honestly?
Maybe the chances are not high. But, I think we have...
few enough candidates that there's a chance
that we just look at it and just get it. It's like... We're going to want it
eventually, right? Yeah. Here's what I'll say. I... I am in favor of asking
for the Strava map now purely from the perspective
of psychological warfare. Well, here's another thing
I'll say about Strava maps. What's uniquely useful when we know someone is
in a mountainous town is normally the street orientation
is going to tell you something. There are long streets that go
parallel to the valley basically. Yeah, I'd say
let's ask for it now, and he's gonna start freaking out,
and that's gonna be really funny, and I want to see
that footage, so... Shall we? I think we shall. So I was just thinking,
well, you know, at least... they've asked most of
the photo questions that would make me
move a lot. You know, there's not a lot left
that would make me move a lot. But no, of course... Alright, Atami. I never got to see Atami.
It's kinda cool. Sam, have you noticed
this awesome thing that they have foot baths
at the train station? Oh, that's delightful.
Can you imagine if... ...the MTA had this? I think they often do
have this sort of thing. It's just a lot less intentional.
Yeah. For me, methodology here... I think is... straight lines? I don't really know. I just kind of have
this feeling that... curvy lines are maybe
easier to match. Whereas straight lines... you know, more generic. Okay, Strava map sent. Which means we draw
another card. I'm just gonna do it from here
while I'm walking. Ten minute bonus.
Sure, why not? That's fine. That's fine. We got our photo. It's a shape.
Yeah, it's... The streets are straighter
than I would have thought. Because a lot of
those mountain towns, the streets are going
to be kind of windy. (yawning) Yeah. These are like,
pretty precisely... a grid? Certainly implies more to it. So I do think that that
helps exclude a lot. I mean, there's quite a few places that that simply
could not be, I think. But the shape is not one
that will be easy to confirm. I think that
we've got three lines that we think he might be on
as our leading theories. So, I think a 50 mile Radar would sort of fully encompass
the nearest one. And also some of the
complexity by the shore. So that seems like a good
way of splitting the map. What do you think?
Oh yeah, let's hit it. Alright, let's hit it. Okay, a lot
of things going on. They just got off
the train at Atami, so I think I'm gonna go ahead
and use my Hangman Curse. It's kind of good to slow
people down whenever. And I might as well use it
because the cost is discarding two, and I have two
five-minute bonuses that I'm very happy to get rid of. So I will be discarding these... and playing this. They've asked me
for a 50 mile Radar. I'm going to go ahead
and answer that. It is a hit. I am going to draw two cards. Ooh, Gambler's Feet. Curse of the Gambler's Feet. For the next hour,
Seekers must roll a die before they take any
steps in any direction. Casting cost: Roll a die. If it's an even number,
this Curse has no effect. Five minute bonus.
Well, I know which one I'm taking. Okay, let's play hangman. Alright, report—
We're doing a report. Hello, from the Ben and Sam report.
Sam, what's going on? We've got a hit.
Okay, we got a hit. That's good.
I think so, yeah. They're gonna have
a much better map than we are right now,
but mentally that means we have... a semi-circle? A pretty semi-ish circle. I would call it a semi-semi-circle.
Yeah. However, I believe we've
already gotten— Ugh. We're playing hangman again. Curse of the Hidden Hangman. Before asking another question or boarding another
form of transportation, Seekers must beat the Hider
in a game of hangman. To play, the Hider chooses
a five-letter word, and the game ends after
either a correct word guess or seven wrong letter guesses. The Seekers cannot
challenge the Hider for ten minutes after a loss. After three losses,
the Seekers are released. I don't like Hangman. Well, at least
we don't have to move. But I do feel like he's used
most of his good words. Now, I've thought of my word. And I'm going to try to use
their strategy against them, which is, last time I did this, they went through
all the vowels immediately. So I'm going to pick
a word that has one vowel, and it's going to be a weird one. Okay, let's play. E.
No. A?
No. I.
No. Adam, just do a normal word. Y.
That's kinda woke culture. Y, also no.
This is going well. There's only two vowels left. O, wrong one. What do you mean it's a no? Okay, try a U. Yes, there is a U. It only took you
five wrong guesses. I mean, do we just... We gotta just throw some
consonants out there, right? I like F. There is not an F. Try a T.
T. Fellas, there is not a T. The word was crumb. Crumb, C-R-U-M-B. Gentlemen, I will see you again in ten minutes. Alright, let's find
a new spot to play. Well, that was
not our finest work. So, here's what I think. There is a train to Fuji,
leaving in 10–15 minutes. I think it would make sense
to get onto it. I think that's
not a terrible idea. All signs point that way.
Okay. Sam, do you want to put
your feet in the footbath? To be honest, no. But, I feel like it's
probably good content. Oh. Ohh, it's warm.
Oh. Oh my goodness.
It is quite nice. We should blur this
on YouTube and make it unblurred on Nebula.
Yeah, I'll do that. That would probably
piss people off. I'll make that deal. This is rejuvenating me and making me more
powerful than ever before. This baby is ready to
get wild and loose. And so are we. Alright, let's play
hangman again. I'm trying to use
a little bit of psychology. I think that they're going to think that I'm going to pick
another weird vowel. So they're going to start by
guessing the weird vowels. But instead, I'm actually
just going to pick a word that has a regular vowel in it. And hopefully it'll take
them a while to get to it. Alright, do you
want to start with one of those
(bleep)-ed up ones like Y? Y. Okay, my theory seems good. Man. Let's just go and
(bleep) up this order. Okay, so...
I think U. U is a no. (bleep), it's no. Maybe we should try an E. No. We need to clear this if we
want to get on the train to Fuji. A. Okay, they got A,
but it took them a while. Okay, we got it.
Let's try a C. C, no. Dammit, okay, do an S. No. It's so over. What about J? J's pretty (bleep)-ed up. Yeah, J is one of the most (bleep)-ed up letters
that there is. Okay, see again. Proof that they think
I'm trying to be tricky. No. Do we— How many
more do we have? Uhh, one. I don't think we're
getting on this train. Uh, B. B, no! The word was graft,
like a skin graft. Alright. What should
we do for the last one? Graft. Yeah, that's a messed up word. Alright, well, we can't get on
this train to Fuji, but that's okay. We're still gonna get
on a train to Fuji. Maybe.
Eventually. Interesting shots, interesting shots,
interesting shots. Look, here on Jet Lag: The Game, we're trying to give you
your money's worth. Whoa! We're getting interesting shots. Interesting shots! Alright. Time for
our third game of hangman. If we win this one,
then we'll have wasted as much of their time
as possible with this Curse. Here's another train to Fuji. Sam, we really gotta
lock in this time. We gotta think of the best letters. I really like the letter C. I feel like the letter C...
Wanna start with C? It's just one of
those letters, man. Oh, shoot, there is a C. Oh, there is a C.
We got it. What could be after C? Could be H, could be T. I'd say, what's
a word that ends -CT? Well, like PACT, but... ...with five letters. SPECT. Try an H, I don't care. No, no H.
I bet it's a T. T, no.
What the hell? Look, let's come back
to that part. A.
No. Okay, things are looking up. (deep gargly voice)
Damn it! Aagh! We gotta go fast. U. No, no U.
I. Shoot, yeah, there is an I.
Okay, something -I-C. Oh, I guess it'd be a K. Yeah, okay, there is a K. Okay, it ends with -ICK.
R would be a good guess. R, okay, good. Yeah, no R. You know, an L would
be a good guess, I think. Okay, yeah, there is an L. This is bad, 'cause they have
two more wrong guesses, and I think there's only
two more possibilities. Alright, what do you think?
Flick or Slick? I think Slick. S, no, it's not S.
But I think... Train's leaving soon,
I think let's try... F?
Let's try Flick. Yeah, they got my ass. It was Flick. Alright, let's
get on the train. Alright, off to Fuji. Curse cleared. Okay, well, you know what?
We won the first two. So that, I mean,
that's a win, you know? I mean, that still wasted, what... almost 40 minutes?
That's pretty good. I am pretty worried about
getting back to shore. Off to Fuji. We'll figure out what we
need to do from there. Yeah, we got this. Whoo! Nice. Quick update from the river. They have gone the wrong way. So in terms of the
""it's so over""/""we're so back"" meter, it swung to us being so back. Currently, we're kind of so back. Which I'm loving being so back. I didn't like it
when it was so over. Aw man, this dude is absolutely swangin' that thing. Oh, hell yeah, my guy! Absolutely! I found more data.
Okay, tell me your data. Alright, it's good data. So, the line before... There's a very local line
that goes out of Fuji. Right.
It stops at these stops. There's a very local line that goes out of Kōfu
and stops at these stops. And then there's
the long-distance service that goes nonstop. The thing is, stops served by
that long-distance service... He's not allowed to be there.
There a train gap more than an hour. He's not allowed to
hide in locations with fewer than
one train an hour. So that means he's either
near the bottom or near the top. But the ones at the bottom... would in at the same prefecture.
Right. So I think that
if I got this right... That if we ask prefecture... We would narrow it
down just a few stations. And they're the stations
that I think he's in based on street shape and
based on train schedules. Do you wanna
ask prefecture now? Yes, might as well
before we get Cursed. I think let's try it. Okay, so Adam's mic
cut out for a second, but here he is
answering our question, then drawing his three cards. Personally, I think it's
even better without sound. (no audible speech) We've got our answer.
What's our answer? It's a no.
It's a no. I think that no
goes down to, just, it stops at Kōfu then. Yeah. We just gotta make sure... that he's— couldn't be
on any other ones. But, I just don't— Because the thing is,
if we have to go back... it'll take forever to get back. Yeah.
So... No, it's, that's so—
It's a one way train to Kōfu. It would be an
irredeemable mistake if you had Kōfu and he wasn't there.
Yeah. He would likely win
off of that mistake. Yeah, so we really gotta... Lock in. Make sure that there
aren't any other lines. Alright, the sun
has come out here, and it is getting a little hot. So I think we should... go find some shade. Some wonderful shade to sit in. My legs are barely
holding it together. Okay, so I went ahead
and reverse engineered... what information they have. And I actually think
it's pretty bad for me. I'm pretty sure they
know I'm in here. Which worries me. We might need to start really
thinking about our hiding spot. Really need to figure out a way to milk a few more
hours out of them. There's Mt. Fuji, Sam.
Oh my god, it's really pointy. I was on top of that, six days ago. I can put a photo up. Okay.
Of me on the top. Show a photo. I want to show a photo
of something too. What do you want
to show a photo of? I want to tell
the audience about how (bleep)-ed up
my foot is. Graphics team,
pull up a photo of my toe. I don't think
we wanna show that. Graphics team, ignore Sam. We want retention. Welcome to Fuji.
We need that train. Okay, so again at this point... pretty sure we know
what line he's on. But, the train does not leave
on that line for quite a while. It's time to do some research to make sure that we really
know what we're doing. We gotta lock in, Ben.
It's lock in time. You wanna get a snack
before we lock in? Okay, it's snack time,
and then it's lock in time. Guess where we are? Back at 7-Eleven
because it's lunch time. ♪ It's our lunch time ♪ What's our lunch gonna be? So many wonderful lunches. Hello, hello, report. We're just, we're doing
more research. We don't have a match yet. Yeah, and we haven't
narrowed down enough where... With a long, straight
street like that... we know it's north-south. We should be able to
match it on angle. I just don't see one on angle. Is there anything
on that line out of Kōfu? East of Kōfu?
Yeah. Well, he couldn't
have gotten there. I think he could
have gotten there. How?
By going through Tokyo. I think he might have
been able to. I mean, you could—
I'm not looking from yesterday. But you can get... all the way up to Otsuki... in less than three hours. So that's another line. Look, this is
the point in the game where I fear that you,
the audience, might get bored. Because they are probably just sort of squinting
at their phone screens, trying to match a Strava map. You know, you can't
see all the maps. So I feel like we
need to do something to keep your attention. So I'm gonna throw
this pen in the air and try to catch it
between my teeth. Alright? And that's gonna be sort of
an exciting diversion while you wait for them
to figure out what to do. Nope, that was not gonna work. Okay. That is a bad idea. Okay, we're still
researching here, but we just don't
quite yet have a match. I think we need to do something
to verify that he's on this line. Because if he's not,
then I don't know where he is. The question now is whether we get on
the limited express up to Kōfu, or the local. The local is slower... but it stops at all of the stations. And I'm advocating,
I think, for the local. Because if we get on the local,
we can use the tool... to check and see if...
Yeah. I mean, I guess, theoretically,
if it's a miss, we just stay on, because we think he's
in Otsuki or something. I mean, look, I don't like being on
the slower one either, but we just... I guess, yeah. We just don't know
what stop he's on. It's gonna be
a long train ride. By the end of it... I'm hoping we know where he is. Okay, now that we are officially on the local line to Kōfu... we're gonna go ahead and ask if our train would
stop at his station. Boy, if the answer is no... and we are stuck on
this local line for three hours,
it's gonna be bad. Hello. So as expected, they have headed up
on the Kōfu line. They've asked me if I am on
the same train line as them. I actually, you know, I don't know how they'll
respond to this answer. It's an interesting answer. And let's draw three more cards.
Alright. One. Okay, Curse of the Bird Guide. Curse of the Bird Guide. You have one chance to film a bird for as long as possible,
up to 15 minutes straight. If, at any point,
the bird leaves the frame, your timer is stopped. The Seekers must then film a bird for the same amount
of time or longer before asking another question. Two. Curse of the Distant Cuisine. Curse of the Distant Cuisine. Find a restaurant within your zone that explicitly serves food
from a specific foreign country. The seekers must visit a restaurant serving food from a country that
is equal or greater distance away before asking another question. All Curses.
Curse of the Frozen Dot. Curse of the Frozen Dot. Place a point on the
map at least 1,000 feet from where the Seekers
are currently standing. If, in exactly 15 minutes, they are within 250
feet of that point, they are frozen in place
for the next 30 minutes. Let me check what
restaurants are around here. Yes, well, all the
restaurant types are in... Japanese, in fact, so... That's not gonna work. Frozen Dot, I don't like it. We're gonna do
Curse of the Bird Guide. Look, there's a Ferris wheel
off in the distance. That's cool. We should be getting this answer
from Adam at any minute. Okay.
Oh, you're cooking? Adam's shape.
Yeah. Oh, he just texted us no.
With a kiss face. It was with a little kiss. Welp. (whispering) Now's not
the time for a little kiss. So, he's not on this line. Okay. We are now in train jail
for the next three hours. We are riding this train
all the way up to Kōfu, and it is going to take a while. However, I believe by the
time we get to Kōfu, Sam... we can figure out where he is. Adam thinks he's got us,
but we are in the cooking zone. This train is now
in the cooking zone, and we are going to...
We're going to use... Just like a very slow boil. Alright, well actually, it looks like they're
staying on that train. So I think let's just
go ahead and find our bird. Actually, you know what, no.
I think we should wait. If they're gonna ride
that line all the way up, then we should do this
while they're about to transfer, like just before. Alright, I'm gonna level with you. It's very hot.
It's crazy how hot it is. As far as I can tell,
there is no air conditioned area where I would be allowed
to just sort of loiter. So never fear.
I have developed a plan to cool off. Check with this. It's not... as close
as I would like. And where is that, Uenohara? Yeah. I'm not sure that's it, Sam. Yeah, I mean, it's close. Oh, yeah. Oh, man. Oh, that feels so good! Oh! You know what? It's not a bad job
at the end of the day. It's not a bad job
at the end of the day. Whew. I mean, look, we can
hang out here for a while. They're not even getting
to Kōfu for two hours. So, basically
what's going on is, we know that he's not on
this line that we're on, which is deeply, deeply painful.
But now we think that... he's kinda gotta be... at one of those stations
that's just east of Kōfu, in Uenohara or Otsuki. And then it's like, there is a line down from Otsuki towards Mt. Fuji,
but we're pretty sure he could not have
had time to take it. But also, you can see
Mt. Fuji down there. Yeah. And so when we asked
for the tallest mountain, he would have showed us
Mt. Fuji. Okay. Back to research. I mean, the thing is, if we
can figure out where he is, and it is a place we can get to
from Kōfu when we get there, I think we're still good. The problem is, if we get to Kōfu, and we still don't know
where he is, who knows? Who knows how much longer
this is going to take? Okay, back to research.
Good bye. If you're playing
on a really big area... sometimes there are
parts of the game where you just get to relax. So if you're playing
the home game, and you're playing it
in a really big area, you just have to take the time to see it as a little bit
of me time. You know?
A little bit of you time, I guess. I've been listening to... little Studio Ghibli scores
and walking around. A wonderful dip in the river. It's not every day you're in a
beautiful Japanese mountain town. I mean, look at that! I mean, it is really incredible. Gosh. Pretty amazing. Look how big
that pipe is, Sam. Look at that big pipe. Okay. I'm in the kitchen. Cell phone service is slightly
peaking this meal prep session. Alright, I think
we need to start scouting birdwatching locations. I thought this park
would have been good, but I can't actually see any birds. I can hear a few birds...
but I can't seem to find them. See, Ben would be better
at this than I am. He's really good at noticing birds. Mmm... I don't know. I don't know. It's damn close, Ben. Let me see. Does that look familiar? Could be. It's close. Could be.
Is that about 0.5 miles? No. It's just a guess. I gotta tell you, really
just not finding a lot of birds. I can hear the birds. But I cannot find them. Little birdie statues do not count. I'm trying to draw a line. I'm cooking. I'm cooking.
I'm cooking. I'm cooking. I'm cooking. Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready. Meal is served. Look, I have used math, science,
and all of the above to combine his overlay
with Google Maps. Whoa.
The proportions are perfect. Where the hell is that? That's Sogu—
whatever the (bleep). Saru— Saruhashi. The proportions are—
The proportions, the shape, and the orientation. Dead on. Okay, wait, wait, wait.
I want credit. I was tracing the exact same thing. Yeah, but I've been
tracing this for 30 minutes, and you didn't believe me. We were both cooking. How soon can we get there? Not soon. (laughs) Not that soon, Ben. I also don't know how he got there. I don't care
about that anymore. You agree, that's it, right? Yeah, I think
that this is a sort of ""ladies and gentlemen, we got him""
sort of situation. And not in the George Bush...
No, no, in the act, in the act. We do actually got him.
Okay. They're finally
getting close to Kōfu. Which means we really do need
to start finding some birds. I really have not had a lot of luck, but I'm wondering if
maybe there will be birds up in the bridge where it's shady. I can hear so many birds.
I just can't see them. (bird cawing) Yeah, I hear you, man,
but where are you? Alright, well, we've
emerged on the other end of a very, very long local line. Yeah, I mean, it really
is just an absolute crawl. Be a little tight. We'll have to be... We'll have to be good
on the short game. Yeah. Let's check the bridge. (bird cawing) Yeah, dude, I would love to chat. I hear you talking.
I just need you to sort of come out. No birds up there. Maybe they don't
like the vibrations. Alright, they just pulled
in to Kōfu Station. I need to start this soon,
because I want to start it such that I finish and cast it right around before
they're going to board. So the next bird I see, I think that's gonna
have to be the one. Alright, there's some birds.
Go somewhere, yes! Yeah, sit up there. Yeah, dude. Freaking sit up there.
That's our bird. That's our bird. Right there. Just can't leave the frame. Oh, he's going somewhere. But not too far.
Don't go too far. Don't go too far.
I still gotcha. I still gotcha. I still gotcha. And he went behind the tree. 24 seconds. Awesome. Whew. It's toasty out. Welcome to Kōfu. One more train,
and then Adam is ours. Yeah. Oh, we're Cursed. Curse of the Bird Guide? Curse of the Bird Guide. The Seekers must film a bird
for the same amount of time or longer than the Hider did,
before asking another question. How long?
24 seconds. (cackles) Oh, poor Adam. He didn't quite get that
bird guide question to pop. I think it's
gonna be better there, where there will be more
open areas and stuff. Yeah, I think that we'll be
able to clear that no problem. I don't think he's gonna be
happy with that result at all. Okay. Now, we are officially
on the train to Adam. Adam Chase, you better
get in your hiding spot. Chase. The Chase is over. He means that
we're gonna kill you. Okay. Let's go to our hiding spot. Okay, so this is one of
the two contenders for hiding spot. This is a really
weird spot to get to. What I like about it
is that the road shape seems like it better matches a different area
that's very annoying. So the hope would be
that they go a really annoying way
to check that area, and then they have to
backtrack and come here. Okay. If this is my spot...
that's the tallest thing I can see. The trouble is... This, I fear, is a driveway. This, I fear... is kind of a driveway situation. Yeah, okay, I think
that's a driveway. Alright, plan B. Alright, well, seemingly
they are not worried about clearing my Curse. Which leads me to believe they probably matched
the Strava map, they know where I am. But we have a backup
that's pretty solid. So I think, we go there,
we hope for the best. Sam, where do you
think he's going to hide? I want to mention for the edit, I want to edit my last statement
to ""The Chase is up."" No, it's too late. Because that
makes a lot more sense. No, it's too late. So here's the thing. There is this weird little community
that's right off of one street, and all of the roads are identical. So I could see it
making a lot of sense for him to hide around there. 'Cause it would be really hard to get a clue as to
where exactly he is. That seems like exactly the kinda
bull-(bleep) that he would do. I don't see a gatehouse
or anything, so... So you think it's fair game? Might just be, you know. Alright we have made it... to our general hiding area. Now we just have to pick a spot. All of the children are
coming home from school in this little suburb. And they are all really confused about why there's
an American... vlogging. I think this is gonna be it. I think this is gonna go ahead... and be our spot. Alright. They're pulling into the station. You know, it'd be really cool if they just didn't
get off the train. Just rolled right through.
That could be interesting. Alright, Adam.
We're coming for you. I think we're going this way. Yeah, they got off the train.
Okay. (sighs) They still can't ask any questions. So I don't want to try
Gambler's Feet yet. I think let's wait till
they clear their Curse. And then we'll go for it. I really have
not seen any birds. This could be... a little tricky.
Yeah. I mean, look. We know that Adam was able
to cast this Curse here by finding a bird. Yeah, so there
must be a bird at least. Sam, I still
don't see any birds. But there's trees and
a river over there. Yeah, let's go there. If I was a bird,
that's where I'd go. I certainly hear birds. (bird tweeting) There!
Oh, bird called out to us. Do I have it? Yeah. Are you counting? Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten... eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen... Ugh, dammit. Alright, check the treetops. (whistling) Oh, you're making that sound. Come on. Come on. Still in frame?
Yeah, we're getting close. What was it, 24?
24. Come on. Oh yeah, it's circling. Come on. We got it, Ben. Alright.
Alright, clear and hit. Clear and hit him. First clear,
if you asked him for a tracing of his
nearest path or street. Hopefully that should be enough. Alright, and
let's draw a card. Would be awesome if it was good. A 30 minute time bonus
would be really sweet. Duplicate another card.
That's not awful. We can duplicate whatever
our biggest time bonus is. It would just be great to
have a bigger time bonus. Okay, oh.
We're putting you back. Hello, we got our answer.
It's... It's a straight ass line. I mean, the angle really
could imply, actually, here. One of those things.
Is that the... That weird development-y thing?
Yeah. There are only going to be
so many spots with a straight line. Okay, look,
he hasn't Cursed us. Do you want to ask for a photo?
Let's do photo. Photo...
Tallest thing, I guess, right? I don't know.
Yeah. Let's get that in. Maybe he doesn't
have any more Curses? Alright. Predictably, they
have asked for a photo of the tallest thing I can see. What do we think that is? Light post, I guess?
Yeah, I think light post. Question answered.
Let's quickly draw another card. Ten minute bonus. Not terrible. Now the real question is... Can we successfully cast
the Curse of the Gambler's Feet? I would say our dice rolling
has not been good so far. Needs to be an odd number. Here we go. Ohohoho, let's go. Oh, no. Curse of the Gambler's Feet. For the next hour,
Seekers must roll a die before they take any
steps in any direction. That's fine. Well, on the one hand,
I think we know where to go. I do think we know where to go. On the other hand, that's
gonna take a minute. Well, now that we have this,
let's just check the map and see if there's anywhere else where that angle
really seems to fit. I mean, there's
this one spot here, but that does not look like
it would have a hiding spot. I think we should
start heading here. I do think that
that's not a bad idea. It's gonna take a minute. Alright.
One. Two. Six. (sighs)
It's gonna be close. I need more time bonus. Because what am I at now? 10 hours, 50 minutes.
I would need another... 2 hours, 19 minutes. Oh. (whispering)
Dude, this sucks. We got a photo. We got a photo. That's not much. Let's do photo towards you. Maybe, is that
going to be that helpful? I don't know, we'll see. Yeah, ask him
photo towards you. Alright, photo toward me. Now the real question is,
do we get something good? Ideally, big time bonus.
Come on. Curse of the Ransom Note. Curse of the Ransom Note. The next question
that the Seekers ask must be composed of
words and letters cut out of any printed material. Casting cost: Spell out
""Curse of the Ransom Note"" as a ransom note. Yeah, can't do that. I can't spell it out
as a ransom note, so... That's useless.
Oh, that's not ideal. (groans) Hopefully they're walking slowly.
Hopefully Ben is walking slowly. Ben, you can normally
count on to walk slowly. And it's very uphill.
It's a very annoying walk. Ben is not going to
be happy about it. (bleep)
Two. Two. Six. We got a photo.
Oh, it's definitely in here. I mean, look. Look.
It's gotta be it. That's it.
Okay, keep going. Just gotta get there.
Keep rolling. Keep rolling. Gosh. I hate this. I— He— Ben you cast this on us. Yeah, I know,
but he must have known! Ben is gonna be
really annoyed with me. And fair enough, you
know, fair enough. I did something very
annoying to them. I do feel bad, but I had to do it.
I had to do it. I had no choice. Keep rolling sixes, Sam. Look, here's the truth. I picked this area because
it's hard to get to. But in terms of actually a
good hiding spot in here, there just isn't one. The key for me was this
is closest to a street that runs sort of lightly
northeast to southwest, and there are two dozen
streets in this area like that. So hopefully they'll have
to kind of explore a bit because there's a lot
of similar streets. Until they find this one. These houses
definitely look right. And let me show you. I'll give you some steps. Six. Let me show you where I think he is.
He has trees in his photos. There's not many trees that big.
And that light view. That line. That line is right. Those trees are right. So I think we just
need to turn right here. Okay.
Go straight down. And remember, as soon
as we get him on camera, we've caught him.
So we can start— stop rolling. Okay, keep going.
That'd be fun. One, two, three, four. They are getting closer. They are only a few minutes away. I don't think that... laying down on the bench
is really gonna do much, but it is worth a try. One, two, ah! Crawl, crawl for it.
No, I got six from that. Two, three, four, five. Two, five. There he is. Ben's coming to kill you.
He's coming to kill you. That sucked. And I know that we're gonna have
to do that tomorrow morning. There's a bus.
Oh, is there? Oh, god.
Yeah. Oh, a bus would
have been lovely. Yeah, I didn't
take the bus either. I realized it as I was walking up.
Oh, you got a Shinkansen... Yeah, isn't that cute? Ugh. It's pretty good, though. It's a strong second place. For now. Ugh!
Alright, goodbye. Alright, Sam. Last run.
See you at Narita Airport. As in, not, I'm gonna
hide there again. As in, I'm not gonna see you.
Yeah, yeah. No, we, yeah, we got that.
Okay, bye. Bye! I almost had it, almost.
Almost had it. Here's the thing,
because I had a duplicate too. So with one 30 minute bonus, it would have turned into
two 30 minute bonuses. That would have
been pretty good. Nearly, nearly. Oh, a strong second place.
A strong second place. And I'm excited to
try to defend your first place spot
tomorrow. The boys are back together,
and we are going to lock in a first and second place
and secure a Sam third place. Yeah, yeah, for sure.
Once again. (outdoor ambience) Good morning, jet laggers.
Welcome to the final day. Good morning.
Good morning! It is the final day,
the final round. Here's the deal. We need to find Sam today.
Yeah. Or our goose, our geese,
I should say... Yeah, they will be cooked. Mostly, at this point,
we just need to figure out a general direction
to start looking. Yeah. And we think a
good way to do that could be by asking if he's
in the same region as us. They have asked, am I
in the same region as them? They're in the Chūbu region. That's a good question for them because they're pretty
close to the border between the regions with that.
I get to pull three cards. One, two, three. Okay. Oh. So I do have... a move card. Move. Discard your hand
and send the Hiders the location of your transit station. This card grants the player
60 minutes to establish a new hiding zone
somewhere else on the game map. The Seekers are frozen
and your hiding time is paused until this new hiding period
is concluded. This card cannot be played
during the endgame. And a move card... That's influential.
I'm absolutely keeping this. That is a really valuable card. I mean, I remember when we
were designing this game, we were really
going back and forth on whether we wanted
to include it, just because it's of its
potential power, you know? I can't play this
once they're here, but if I see them
coming towards here... I could really waste a lot
of their time, I think, by going somewhere
completely different. This, honestly,
the more I think about it... the more I think that,
by the end of this day, this card could be the thing
that wins me the game. Caption+ by JS*

welcome to episode five of our six-day game of
hide-and-seek across Japan. Right now, we're about seven hours
into Ben's second run, and things aren't looking great. If Ben lasts another three hours,
this will become the longest run and start extending his lead. If it lasts until
the end of the day, then things get even worse. We'll have less than
two days remaining, meaning that after we catch him, I likely wouldn't even get
a second run at all. Fortunately, the remaining map
is quite small. We have him narrowed down to this area around
the Izu Peninsula, but we haven't quite found a spot
that makes a ton of sense. We're pretty sure that
he wouldn't have had time to make it down here, and this part of the map
doesn't seem to have the mountains that he
sent us a photo of. So right now we're heading
up to this area here to check out the Gotemba Line. We just deployed a 25 mile Radar
on our way to be absolutely sure that we're in the right region. The good news is that
the Radar is going to be a hit. We're not too far off. The bad news is... well, I'll just let Ben explain. Sam and Adam... have just... have gone to Mishima and asked for a 25 mile Radar. It is a hit.
I'm within 25 miles of Mishima. But that is not the right way. They were— They coulda
come straight down here. So I think that they must
be missing something. I'm just not sure
what that thing is. They're gonna have to
untangle this mystery pretty soon, or... or this is going to
become the winning run. Clock is ticking, boys.
Clock is ticking. Okay, it's a hit, so... We know we're not going insane. Yeah.
Which is good. We haven't massively blown it. He's not up there. He's gotta be on the
freaking Gotemba Line, man. Which one is that? Honestly, we should
just get on the Gotemba Line and ask if he's on the same line. I agree, but if he is, we should be able to
find that building. I know. Passengers transferring
to the Gotemba Line Okay, wait. Yeah, we need to get off here. ...may exchange trains here. Yeah. Okay, ready? It's supposed to
leave in one second. Well, you know,
these rural lines are here now. Yeah, okay.
Okay... Go, go, go. Platform five, you said?
Yep. Is it gone? Yeah. Well, now that
they've got their answer, which I guess should be
somewhat of relief, I do get to look at
the next two cards and draw one, so... Let's look. It's a five minute bonus. And it's a five minute bonus. Which five minute bonus
do I want more? I want this one. Boy, yeah, I don't really know what's going on with them. I think that they think
they've crossed out my zone. And I think that they're wrong. I think that they've made
a mistake somewhere. And I think that until
they can figure out what mistake they made... they're not gonna find me. He has to be
on the Gotemba Line. I think so. It seems impossible
that he could not be. We have an hour and
six minutes left of our Curse. It's probably frustrating
because I think that hits the next two
departures from here. Okay. This is the next train. Are you rolling it? You roll. Okay.
I'm not good at it. Alright.
I believe in you, Sam. Come on, come on. Hopefully this'll get
us out of the heat. I believe in you. You can do this. Nice. Okay. Let's get on the train. Alright, we're moving. Do you want to ask him
if he's on the same line? (sighs) Might as well. Okay, look.
If the answer to this is no, then I'm... totally baffled. Okay, well, because Adam and
Sam are going the wrong way... we get to eat food. Which is pretty exciting. I just went to this cafe
and pointed at stuff on the menu that I kind of recognized. And it's great. Oh man, okay. They're asking if I'm on
the same line as them. They're asking it
for double because... they technically already asked that.
They didn't want to. It was when I hit them
with the randomize, if you remember. But I think they need to know
if I'm on this line or not. So I get to get the reward twice. And they're not
gonna like to hear... that I am not on this line. Got an answer. He's not on the same line. I don't... (exhales) We must be missing something. We simply must be. How is that possible? So that means I get
to look at the top three. And draw one. Twice. Discard two, draw three.
Curse of the Zoologist. Curse of the Zoologist. Take a photo of a wild fish, bird,
mammal, reptile, amphibian, or bug. The Seekers must take a picture of a wild animal in
the same category before asking another question. Oh, god. That could be brutal. And draw one, expand
maximum hand size by one. I'm taking Curse of the Zoologist.
So if I can find... a frog, or a snake,
or a lizard, or something. That could make it quite
difficult for them to clear this. And then I get to do it again. Curse of the Black Hole. Curse of the Black Hole. Draw a 75 mile radius
around the Seekers. They cannot ask any questions
while in that zone for the rest of the round. Casting cost: Seekers cannot be within 100 miles of
your hiding zone. Five minute bonus... and discard one, draw two. Eeeh. So, Curse of the Black Hole
is not going to work. I guess the question is just,
do I want to get rid of my five minute bonus for... a discard one, draw two? And I actually think I don't. Because, at that point,
there would be nothing else that I would want to discard.
So I'm just not taking any of this. He has to be on
the other line, then. Which other line?
The one that goes west. The one that you think
doesn't have enough mountains. It's surrounded by rice fields. Alright, well, let's get off
this stupid train. Oh, my god. I don't... Well... Things are going bad. So now that we have the
Curse of the Zoologist... which I think is a very good Curse,
one of the best... especially if you've got time, and I think that I might have
a little bit of time while they try and
figure out... their mistake... I'm gonna go tromp
back into the woods and try and find a snake. In a safe way.
Not a dangerous way. And it will hopefully make... Sam and Adam's head explode. Okay. What are we missing? So, here's the state of the map. With the Gotemba Line excluded, there are only a handful
of stations left in play. There are a few down here, but we don't believe he
could've gotten there in time. There are some along the coast here, but the geography
just doesn't match up. He shouldn't have been able to
see the mountains down here. Then there are a few stray stations
over here and over here, but we've been
checking their streets against the Strava map,
and none of them seem to line up. So basically, we must be
getting something wrong. And the longer it takes us
to figure out where we messed up, the more likely it is
that he'll make it all the way to the end of the day and put me out of
the running for good. It feels like we know
all of our options. And, I feel like the
most plausible thing at this point is a mistake. I mean, honestly, maybe we should
throw down Tentacles. At this point. I mean, at this point,
we are in trouble, time wise. ♪ Back into the woods
to find a snake ♪ ♪ It's time to find
a snake today ♪ ♪ And we're gonna take
a picture of the snake ♪ ♪ or a frog or a fish ♪ ♪ or something that will make ♪ ♪ Adam go postal
and kill everybody ♪ ♪ in Japan ♪ We at least believe... that he could not have
made it south of Itō based on the schedules
that we are aware of. But I would say that
I'm not 100— That's not something I feel like,
you know, that's not proof positive. As far as I can tell... he has to be on this line... maybe this line... or somewhere in here. Those are the only lines
I can identify that are possible. Yeah.
Unless he made it down here... because we are wrong
about the schedules. I even scoured that line.
It didn't seem a great fit. I mean, I didn't
spend that much time. So, I don't know. I know that the vibes
don't seem right on the western line. But at this point... I think that we might have
to check or something. You know what I mean?
Mhm. I mean, what
do you think, with? I mean, I would maybe
throw down a Tentacles. We're so lost that I'm not barely
even worried about Curses anymore. I at least need to
figure out what's good. Yeah, I'm not against
Tentacles at this point. Because also, if it's a miss, then we know he's
not anywhere on here. Yeah. Let's Tentacle. Let's do aquarium, shall we? Sure. I'm just like,
at this point man, Yeah.
I'll do anything. Yup. I don't... I don't see any snakes. I don't know how
nature documentarians do it. I'm not sure what
you're supposed to say when you're just like, ""I don't know.
I don't see anything yet."" Okay, well they've
just done a Tentacles. They've done an aquarium Tentacles. They've done an aquarium Tentacles
from Shimo-Togari. I am... not within 15 miles of there. But... I will happily take
a look at four cards and take two. Or maybe not even up to two.
So my hand's looking pretty good. I honestly think that the hand
is getting close to optimized. Okay, Curse of the Census Taker. Curse of the Census Taker. The Seekers must immediately
visit a town or city hall within a mile of
their current location. When there, they must
estimate the population under that town hall's jurisdiction and get the answer
correct within 25%. Otherwise, you are awarded
an extra 30 minutes. Casting cost: The Seekers'
next question is free. 15 minute bonus,
5 minute bonus, 15 minute bonus. Them 15 minute bonuses
are pretty schweet. So I'm just gonna replace
my five minute bonus with a 15 minute bonus. And, you know,
it's not that exciting, but honestly, my hand is
pretty freaking optimized right now. I've got an hour 35
of time bonuses and a really good Curse.
So I, you know, I'm not sweating it. (wind rustling)
Yeah. You know? He is not within 15 miles of us. What the (bleep)
Okay. So that has to mean
he's on the little line, right? Train's coming pretty soon. So theoretically, that's not
supposed to leave for three minutes. And we're done in 90 seconds. Okay. Well, we could roll for it anyway,
just see if we can get on it now. Might as well,
yeah, just in case. Okay.
Great. Actually, let me
just pull something up. Okay.
Hold on a second. Here's the thing. I think that we need to
double check south of Itō. Just wait a second.
Okay. Yeah, Google was wrong. Awesome. So he's probably south of Itō? According to Apple Maps,
he could have gotten there... Yeah, of course he could.
5:55. Yeah, of course he could. 'Cause seemingly
Google will not route you on the Shinkansen there
for some reason. Yeah, okay.
So... So that's almost
certainly where he is. Well, let's look into it. Do you want to look
at Strava shapes, and I'll look at...
I'll try to find that building? Yeah. This sucks. I feel like it's so easy
to find a snake when you're not looking
for a snake. But all of a sudden, when you're trying to go
and rassle up a snake... to have for Jet Lag: The Game... you can't find a snake. No snakes. But check this out. That's pretty cool. Maybe I should hide in there. In that... cave. It's getting rainy.
At least Ben might get rained on. I'm noticing that, yeah.
That'd be nice, right? If that ends— Oh boy.
At least... Do we win if Ben... Gets struck by lightning? Gets struck by lightning
and loses a pulse? No, I think that his time...
I think we still have to find him. Even if he's dead.
But if him is gone... I guess if he can't
answer questions... Well, yeah.
That would disqualify him. And I guess
it's a question of... is it more about his soul? Or his mortal form?
Yeah. What is the him
we're trying to find? I have been
going into the woods and shouting snake. And no snakes have appeared. Isn't there a frog?
A cute little frog over here? Is there a cute little frog... here? Is there a cute little fr— No? Mother-(bleep)-er. This sucks. (chuckles) Okay. So... We should be able to
narrow it down decently. Because even with
Apple Maps' definition, it would have gotten there
at 5:55. So he would've had
just over 30 minutes. Okay. We were about to head down there
three hours ago. If this ends up being the thing, it'll be the greatest
Apple Maps advertisement. Well, yeah, it'll also be
a great endorsement of vetoes. Because he vetoed
the biggest body of water. Yeah. And if we had seen that,
that would have told us quite a lot. Yeah. (storm winds whipping) Alright.
It's getting rather stormy. So there are
only a few stations that are far enough south, that are more than
15 miles south of Atami. So we should only look at those. (wind surging) Whoa-ho-ho! Okay, so—
Izu-Kōgen is the first one. According to this,
Izu-Kōgen is the furthest one he could have gotten to. Well... Let's take a look. We're on the move again. Looks like they went to Numazu. Numazu Station. I'm not there, so... Keep looking, I guess. So you're looking
at street shapes, right? Oh, I'm looking at pictures. Oh, I was looking at pictures. I've got it. You got it?
I've got it. That's it. Look at that. Look at that roof. That's it. (wheezes) Where is it? Where is it? It's Izu-Kōgen. It's also the furthest one
he could have gotten to. Well, at least we got it. Never trusting
Google Maps again! Anyway, Google's
our employer, technically. Or not technically.
I'm... Google pays us our money. I was a Google Maps
loyalist for so long. No, something flipped.
And now... Apple Maps got better. Okay, so just to be clear,
what happened was: Ben is at a station
that Google Maps told us that he couldn't have gone to. Well... we'll get there in
an hour and a half. Awesome. We only have a... a three minute connection. Eugh! I hope this rain
doesn't affect that. Oh my god. (wind gusting) I think God is
intervening in this game. (thunder rolling) (thunder rolling) Sam, it's time
for our train to leave. Whee! The train is leaving—
Wait, we're not on a train at all. I think we might miss
our three minute connection. Yeah. You know what this means, Adam?
What's that? You know what this means?
What does it mean? We missed the connection. By the time that we get there, we're going to be
searching in the dark. Awesome. Holy moly. (thunder rolling)
(snickers) They're never going
to find me in this. So will it be dark
already when we get there? It'll be just getting dark, because I think
we'll get there at six. Perfect. Well, at least it's
a really big place that'll have so much
artificial light. Yeah! Ooh, ooh. Sam, I think there might be
a lot of museums there. Yeah? So we could use the
museum one mile Tentacles. Oh, that could be big. But I'm saying, in terms
of searching in the dark... Yeah. This way they
would give us, you know. Yeah. Because the real thing is, we have to find him
before the day ends, so that we both can
have time for runs. Yeah. (wheezes) Okay, look, we're moving.
We're gonna get there. Ultimately, it's going to be fine. Yeah. Probably. Eventually, it'll be fine. Alright, well... It's looking like the storm
is just about passed, but... Adam and Sam are now seemingly
heading the right way. So... I think it's time for us
to get back out there. And get in position. And that they have not
had a fun run thus far. But I am not... going to make the endgame
any easier than I have to. Our train has
moved quite quickly. And I think we actually
might make our connection. Yeah, we'll be tight,
but we've got a shot. Alright, let's punch it. (hums softly) Nice. Wow, what an adorable train. We never get to sit this way.
Oh, this is very cute. I wonder if this is
why Ben took this train. Yeah?
'Cause it's so adorable. Sam and Adam seem to be
making a beeline for me. So, I don't know if I explained
my hiding strategy. I don't know how we're
editing this, but... So far, the endgames have all
been dictated by photos, right? We've all been able
to find all of us with just a photo.
So, I'm thinking that... Adam and Sam are going
to try and find me with just a Photo, probably.
And I think... that I can use that
to misdirect them. I think what I need to do... is I need to go hide somewhere in the middle of town. Just a random street. But then I put on
my ghillie suit and I sort of sit
in front of some trees or some shrubbery. And if they ask for
a photo of me, then... it might look like
I'm in the woods, and they might go
explore the woods first. And then, once they realize
that I'm not in the woods... in order to find me
on some random street, they're gonna have to be
really systematic about it, and they're gonna have to
ask a bunch more questions in order to narrow the area down. And when that happens,
I might get... some better time bonuses or... maybe even some Curses
I can use in the endgame. Who knows?
So we're gonna keep wandering and hopefully we can find
something that looks like that. Oh, look at that. It's the ocean! Which way do we go? Let's go this way. Let's go this way. Which way now? Let's go this way. I'm just fully getting
myself lost up here. I mean, I don't even know
where I'm going. And my signature strategy... is that if I don't know
where I'm going, they don't know where I'm going. And boy... I really do not know
where I'm going. It's getting dark. Alright Sam, well there is
still a little bit of light out. I think it'll
probably be gone soon. Yeah, so we should
really try to find him quickly. Yeah.
The game day ends at 7:30. So it goes into the dark.
Yes. The sun is starting to set, and I have just
sort of been wandering and wandering and
wandering about my zone. And now I'm completely lost. But that is what I wanted. Because I don't want there to be any logic as to where I am.
And... I think this street
could be kind of perfect. Because if I perch
myself up there... just on top of this rock... in front of this shrub... then, it might kinda look
like I'm in the woods. 'Cause you mostly just see trees. And on this side,
you mostly just see trees. So... I think let's go perch up here. Eh-beh-beh-beh-beh. Eh-beh-beh-beh-beh. It is looking like their train
is gonna be here soon, but... they're gonna have to
move quickly, because... the sun is about to set. And honestly,
once the sun is fully down, I think it's gonna become
nigh impossible to find me. All that is to say,
time is of the essence. At least for them.
I got all the time in the world. Alright, I think... Yeah, I agree. So I think— Hit him with it now, yeah. Got an awfully
complicated set up now. Hello. So it looks like they're here. And they're starting off bold. They're starting off bold
with a Tentacles. Should certainly
narrow the area down, and it's smart of them
to be going so systematically. But, Tentacles is still Tentacles. And that means that I still
get to look at the top four and draw two. The four I got are a five minute bonus,
Curse of the U-Turn. This basically lets me
force them off their train if they're going
the wrong direction. Not useful now. Another five minute bonus,
or a randomize question. I mean, randomize question is gonna be better
than that damn Curse that I'm never gonna be able to use because I can't seem
to find a snake. Perfect. That one? Kitagawa? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Photo of the tallest
thing he can see, or photo of him? Tallest thing he'd be able to see.
Tallest thing he could, yeah. Oh, but photo straight up
is probably gonna be just the woods, isn't it?
Yeah. I think tallest thing. 'Cause that'll tell us
woods regardless. If it's the woods, it's the woods.
You know what I mean? If it's tallest thing, at least
we can look for something. Okay, do that?
Yeah. Okay! Let's hurry. These are cute.
It's little teddy bear guys. Tallest thing I can see. A photo of the tallest
thing that I can see. What can I see? I suppose it's probably that light pole over there, right? Okay. I'll go take a picture of that
and send it over. I don't think it's going
to be very clear, but... Maybe I'll be able to
make something of it. Oh my god. Curse of the Gambler's Feet. For the next hour,
Seekers must roll a die before they take any steps
in any direction. Casting cost: Roll a die. If it's an even number,
this Curse has no effect. Oh my god. Let's think. Hopefully there's— There's the (bleep)-ing... Yeah, there's the thing. All the lights are on now. Alright, we got our photo.
He's clearly kind of... in bushes or something.
Next to... I guess a light pole. So we know he's near a street.
Perfect. Can you take this
while I navigate? Yep. So the tallest thing
he can see is a light post. Yeah.
So that's great. We just need to ask him more stuff
before we get Cursed. We could do a
quarter mile Radar. You know what we should do?
Send the nearest street photo. Oh yeah, the outline?
Yeah. Yeah, let's do that. Because we can
match that to a street. That's probably
the best way to find him. Well the other thing is, where are there dense
enough woods that... he would only be able
to see a light post? You know what I mean? Okay, I'm rolling this die and everything I'm doing
here is really janky. But I just have to
roll an odd number to get the Gambler's Feet
Curse to work. Here we go. Oh. What is it? That's a three. Yeah, that's a three. Okay. Sorry, sorry, Sam and Adam. Wow, we've been
hit with Gambler's Feet. Curse of the Gambler's Feet. For the next hour,
Seekers must roll a die before they take any steps
in any direction. Yeah, well,
kinda saw that coming. At least we got in
a lot of useful questions. I don't know why
he didn't Curse— We have enough questions that I honestly think that we
could find him with just this. Alright. Six! Okay. They've asked for another question. They've asked for me to
trace the nearest street. That could be quite useful,
but there's a lot of streets. Top one, what is it? Oh my (bleep)-ing god. It's a 30 minute bonus, right?
I can't quite see. Yeah, that's a 30 minute bonus. I think I'm up to
two hours of bonuses now. That's crazy! Three. Yeah. The street lights are
on the right side. One. We should take a minute,
by the way, to set the stakes. If we don't find him by 7:30, then his hide will go
into the next game day. And Sam, it will be impossible—
Yeah. You won't get another run.
Yeah, that is true. Oh, we have an answer.
Okay. This should do it. Is it this? Maybe?
Which one, which one? This one. Oh? I think I got it. It's this. Is that what you were seeing? Well, it's one of these, I think. It's gotta be this.
That one seems most likely. Doop-doop. Shoop-shoop. Right?
Yeah. Bahp-bohp.
Sure seems right. Not too far away from it.
No, it's five minutes... Five minutes walking normally.
No, we gotta go this way. Five, One, two. Alright, hello. They are getting closer. So I'm gonna turn off
this light, and hopefully... (chuckles) Hopefully they just
won't see me out here. Okay, we're going dark. Wait, I wanted that to be cooler. Okay, we're going dark. Wait, no. Okay, we're going dark. (bleep)-ing turn off! No! Why did my remote turn on? I really— I thought
this was gonna be so cool. I thought it was gonna be so cool
when I say ""we're going dark."" Alright, we're going dark. I got it to work. Aah. I can't believe the
game designers made it so that this game could
go into the night. It's a little bit OP
for hide-and-seek. Well, you know,
you kinda have to earn it though. Yeah. Alright, I think this is our right. This is our right, okay.
Yep. Is that the light pole? Six. No, we're not close enough.
Okay. This up here is
the start of our street? The right?
No, straight. It looks like he
should be on the left. And the light poles actually
will give us a shortcut. One, two. 'Cause he's gotta be
near a light pole. Five. Well, here's
the first light pole, so we should— Okay, is that
the same light pole? Can we check that?
Wait a minute. I see a faint green light. Okay, wait, five.
One, two. Our microphones
make faint green lights. Oh, there he is!
Five, hey buddy! It's the DJI that gave it away. It's the little
DJI microphone! Hi. Are you wearing a ghillie suit?
I am. That's fun. That was a pretty annoying day
we ended up having. Yeah. And now in first
and second place. Yeah, well I also have
over two hours of time bonuses. What the (bleep)?
Yeah. So it's gonna be a
tough one for you guys. Well, Adam, you better get going. Okay, bye!
Bye. Bye, Adam. Oh, he's running. Oh, he stopped running. Alright, Sam, let's go
find a place to go to sleep. Yeah. Alright! We're back and better than ever! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Hello and welcome
to this episode of the Jet Lag: The Game
ad read. I'm your host, Sam, and joining us today
is Mr. Adam Chase. Hello, good to be here. And Mr. Den— Ben Doyle. I am happy to be
on the podcast. Let's talk about chemtrails. No, today we are talking about why they should
sign up and listen to our podcast, The Layover. And the bit is that we're doing it
in the style of a podcast. (laughs exaggeratedly) It's a funny bit.
Yeah. So Ben, tell us
about your experience being on the Layover podcast. Well, on the Layover podcast, you know, it's fun
because we get into all the behind-the-scenes, the stuff you might'a not
seen on the show. And we talk about our strategies. We talk about some sort of crazy ideas we have
that you might not hear about. Like, who really caused
the COVID-19 pandemic? That isn't something we
talk about on there at all. But I will say that
the whole show is supported by the Nebula subscribers. And so we kind of figured, why not do something
special for them to thank them for being subscribers. And that's sort of in some ways why this aftershow is
exclusive to Nebula. That's kind of the idea there.
So anyway, you know... Let's stop the podcast though
for a quick word from our sponsor... signing up for Nebula,
which you can do for 40% off when you use the code
nebula.tv/jetlag. And sort of something—
I've mentioned this before and do want to just
emphasize it again. It'd be really great
if you use that code if you sign up for Nebula,
because sort of the financial model just to sort of, you know,
let them in on this. We only get our money, honey,
if you use our code. If you just go and sign up
for Nebula just regularly, they don't know we sent you, and so we don't get directly,
you know what I'm saying? I am the world's
foremost expert on finance. Yeah.
And... My advice
that you should follow is that this is a very good deal.
Mhm. And...
Yeah. Because at 40% off, that's... You're only paying 60%.
Yes, exactly, yeah. And that is a very... That is a sizable,
that is a big discount. It's a big discount.
Yeah. And I finance. You finance.
Yeah, that's true. That's true. Well, in a sense, they finance because the Nebula supporters
are the ones who fund the show. Mhm. No, but I know finance. Of course, yeah.
I'm really good at finance. Ben, take us out.

this ghillie suit in my bag for four days now. And I'm about to prove
that the only person who can hide longer than me ...is me. I'm really scared
I'm gonna fall off this cliff. Oh my god. Hello, and welcome back
to episode four of our six-day game of hide-and-seek across Japan. Right now, it's the
morning of day four, and we're at the halfway
point of the game. So far, each player has
had one round to hide, putting Ben at the top of the board
with just shy of a 10-hour run. With three days remaining,
we're all expecting to get at least one more run,
so these final rounds could completely change
the course of the game. When we last left off,
Ben and Adam caught me in Narita International Airport, giving Ben a central and
well-connected starting point for his second round. If he can beat his first time
and hide for longer than 10 hours, he'll maintain his first place lead
and set an even higher hurdle for Adam and I to beat
if we want to win the game. So without further ado,
let's try to find Ben. Sam, it is 7:30,
and we gotta go, go, go. Yes, we do. There is a Narita Express
in 10 minutes. Yeah, and I think
we just want to go to Tokyo Station, right? Yeah, we definitely
just want to head straight to Tokyo Station. I mean, there is a
potential opportunity to ask a hotter-colder, because we're going to
be moving immediately. Yeah, although
I think most likely... I don't think that Ben
is going to, you know, go into the territory
that we know, because... I agree. You know, the fact
that we've played north means that we kind of
have an advantage. So, I mean, I think that means
he's going to take the Shinkansen that goes to Niigata...
Nagano, and Ōsaka. Or, yeah. So there's kind of three options, and they all start in
the same direction. I think we
need to walk faster. What's interesting
about this place is that it's got some
very strong strengths... and it's also got some
very strong weaknesses. There are definitely
some questions that if they ask them,
I'm in big trouble. For example, if they ask for a photo of my
largest body of water. As you have seen,
I am near to the ocean. And so they will know that
I'm near to the ocean, and that's going to give away
a lot of information. So, I'm hoping that
they don't ask that, and that at least if they do,
they don't ask it for quite a while. Because then I'd have to, you know,
send them something like that, and that's... That would be trouble. What car are we? Is it six?
Yeah. Alright, do we want
to try to figure out sort of the rough limits of
where he could have gotten? We could,
although, I don't know. I don't think it's
really going to help us. Yeah, I don't know if it's— we need to for the first step, yeah.
We just need a direction. Okay, you know
what I will say, would not necessarily
be a bad question, just at this point... is distance from Shinkansen because we're about as
far from a Shinkansen as we would naturally be often.
Mhm. So, it would be
interesting to know. You know what I mean? If he's close to a Shinkansen, because if he's further
from a Shinkansen, that would cut down
the map a lot. You know what else could be kind of an interesting
question to ask, just for what it's worth? Is if his distance from a major city
is greater or lower than ours. 'Cause if it's lower,
then it's like, well, he's in a major metro area. And if it isn't, then it's like,
we can exclude quite a bit. I guess we could ask that, and then we could ask
the Shinkansen thing. Yeah, but even if we
asked both those things, we wouldn't have a direction.
No, we wouldn't, but those would be two
useful questions to ask now. I could— How about that?
Okay, yeah, let's do that. Let's do it
while they're useful. Okay, alright. I'm gonna have to draw
a lot of circles. This... stupid
ghillie suit is too hot. I am...
I have gotta take this off. Look, we'll bring it back out
in a little bit. But I do not need it right now. Oh. We got our first question. Distance from major city. I am further than 29 miles
from a major city. There is still much of the
greater Tokyo area to explore. And I hope that they waste
as much time there as possible. Now that they have asked me
whether I am closer to a major city, I get to look at
the top three cards. Curse of the Unguided Tourist. Curse of the Unguided Tourist. Send the seekers an unzoomed
Google Street View image from a street within 500 feet
of where they are now. Without using the
internet for research, they must find what you
sent them in real life before they can use transportation
or ask another question. 20 minute bonus. Discard one, draw two. Honestly, I think that all in all, we might be overvaluing
Curses a little bit. Because thus far,
I did have that one Curse on them that seemed to really kill them. But honestly, I got
quite lucky with that. And all the other Curses
have been pretty clearable. Certainly, I think a 20 minute bonus
is better than... ...a meh Curse. Okay, he is further. So now we're going to
draw all of our circles. So Adam, best I can tell,
based on schedules... he could not have made it either onto this line
or onto this line. Meaning, basically, if he didn't take this Shinkansen, we can exclude all of this.
Okay, well that's good. So would we want to
ask closest Shinkansen? Well, do we want to first ask if his distance from a Shinkansen
is greater or lower than ours? Because we're
20 miles out now, right? Yeah, do we have enough time
to do both if we want to? Yeah, yeah, I think so. Well, I mean, yeah,
we could do close to Shinkansen now. I mean, 20 miles or so
is fairly useful, I think. Hit it? Yeah, yeah, hit it. Alright, team. Team Ben. We've got another
question from the boys. They've asked us the question,
are we closer or are we further to a Shinkansen line
than they are? And they are 21 miles from one. I'm closer. I don't know if that's what
they wanna hear or not. Eh, they still don't have
a direction to go, but they're getting
the map down quick. Okay, well, it's
another top three peek. And let's just hope we get ourselves
maybe a solid Curse or a big time bonus or something. Curse of the Bridge Troll. The Seekers must
ask their next question from under a bridge. Casting cost: The Seekers must be
at least 50 miles from you. A 15 minute bonus,
and a 10 minute bonus. Now, Curse of the Bridge Troll, that is not going
to be hard for them to do where they are. And it does— It tells them that they are at least
50 miles from me. So that's gonna draw—
That basically gives them a free 50 mile Radar. So I'm just gonna take
a 15 minute bonus, and I don't know.
Yeah, we're going kinda— We're going time bonus
strategy this time. Maybe that'll work.
I have no freakin' clue. Let's go into town. Maybe we can find somewhere
that is not so hot so that I can stop sweating. Or at the very least,
I can find a fluid to put in my body so that I can produce more sweat
and not die. (claps) Let's go. Hey, Adam.
Yes? The answer is... Closer. That'll probably be useful.
Yeah. Let's try to figure out
how to mark this. It's not gonna be easy. Here's what I think we need to know. We're about to get to Tokyo Station. Do we go up to Ōmiya? Or do we go west?
You know what I mean? Because these all start
by going to Ōmiya. Yeah. So I think that's
what we need to figure out. So we just need a question
that cuts this off, or these off. It looks like
on the airport map, so we're actually now
closer to Haneda Airport. Yeah. So it would draw a nice
straight line up to Niigata, which would split the region. And the thing is,
there's a lot of likely territory that would be closest to Haneda. So if we hit it... we would know at least
we could head up to... what is it called, Takasaki? Well, if we know
he's on one of these, yeah, we could go up to Takasaki,
which would be really nice. I kinda dig... Let's try it. Let's try it.
...airport. Yeah?
Yeah, yeah. Okay. We have reached the town. I don't really know
anything about this town. The one thing I did see on the map
is that there's a teddy bear museum. So that's pretty exciting. Oh man, we got another
question from them. They're asking if my... closest major international airport
is the same as theirs. Theirs is Haneda. And unfortunately, mine is too. (chuckles) That's really gonna
narrow it down. Which, you know, isn't great. The amount of information
that they have gathered in a very, very
short period of time. Well, I guess I'll let them know. I think at this point,
we are really relying on them to make a big mistake. 'Cause I don't know exactly what
their map looks like right now, but it has gotta be pretty small. But anyway, I answered their
airport questions, so... Let's look at our top three. It's a 15 minute bonus,
a 10 minute bonus, and a Curse of the Jammed Door. Curse of the Jammed Door. For the next three hours,
the Seekers must roll dice to pass through a doorway. Casting cost: Discard a card. A 15 minute bonus is nice. But I think that I gotta try
the Curse of the Jammed Door again. I mean, last time,
it bought me hours. Hours. Man, they are going to be... very, very happy when they learn that my
nearest airport is the same. Oh, dear. Same, it's a hit. Hohohohohoho! Benjamin Doyle. Do you think we can
wrap this up by noon? Hoo-hoo-hoo! Oh, Benny boy. That, I mean, look,
we're not even on— We don't even—
Let's just fold this guy up. I don't even need to
look at the rest of this. We're not even close to
done with our first train, and we've got it down
to one fold on the map. Or really a half fold.
He is in here, or in here. Technically,
that would be annoying. That would be annoying. My best guess right now is that he's somewhere
around Nagano. Yeah, I would agree with that. I think we want to definitely
get on a Shinkansen. Yeah. And let's head
kind of west, northwest. Yeah, let's just
get into our likely zone. Yeah. And then once we're
getting up there, we can do a hotter-colder
to cut off and make sure he isn't down here,
where he might be. Yeah. And if he is, we can backtrack,
and it won't be that bad. But I think high likelihood
he's up here. Yes, almost certainly. Yeah, I mean, it would be lucky if he was down there
for him, basically. Yeah, it would be
pretty lucky, but it would also not be that bad.
We could just head over there. Yeah, I mean,
it's on the Shinkansen. And honestly, there's not
that much around there. No. There is some good
views of Mount Fuji, which maybe he's into. I mean, I would say
that it would be... Well, you know what? You want to ask for a view of the tallest mountain
that he can see? From his station?
And just check if it's Mount Fuji? Photos are cheap, yeah. I mean, we might as well
ask a photo while we're at it.
Just, might as well. Sure. The station is
pretty cool looking. It's got this little
plaza in the middle. And as you can see,
it's completely empty. Okay, so they've asked
for a picture of the tallest mountain
visible from the station. I mean... The fact of the matter
is that I'm not really... I wouldn't say that
I'm in the mountains. So I don't know if this is really
going to be all that helpful. I believe the tallest mountain
visible from the station is... (clicks tongue)
...right up there. I went all around the station, and I think that's
the tallest one I can see. Yeah. Yeah. I'm hoping that... you know, because
I can see a mountain, I'm hoping that they
kind of conclude, you know, ""Oh, he's in the mountains?"" Because if you look at
my station on a map, it doesn't really scream
'in the mountains'. You might not think
'in the mountains'. So I'm hoping that this at least sort of directs
their attention elsewhere. Alright, let's sit down
and draw ourselves a card. It's a randomize question. Hmm. I don't know if I really
want to discard that to play
Curse of the Jammed Door. That Curse is better when they're...
in a less dense area. And right now, they are, you know,
smack dab in the middle of Tokyo. Yeah, it looks like they're just... maybe just getting
into Tokyo Station now. (grunts) The Shinkansen just
left two minutes late. I know. I have been waiting for
the news story about it. Well, Sam, we are on our way...
up on the Shinkansen. And Ben has sent us
a picture of a mountain. It's not Mount Fuji. It certainly does not
look like Mount Fuji. To be honest, it only makes me think of
Nagano more, because... It has huge Nagano vibes.
The geography of Nagano... it seems actually quite similar
to his first hiding spot, where there's a lot of these
kind of narrow valleys, with cool onsen towns
quite close to it. And this kind of looks like...
I mean you can see here. It just shows these
kind of lumpy rolling hills. Yeah. It would seem that Adam and Sam
have boarded the Shinkansen... north towards Nagano. And, whether or not I'm in Nagano,
I will leave a mystery. You know, they really
don't mess around with the bamboo out here.
I mean, this is like a... This is like a chunky...
(knocking) It's like metal. Look how thick this guy is. This is crazy. (knocking) Listen to that.
That's a solid piece of bamboo. I kind of understand
why so much of the —Oh! Oh, something dropped
on me. Oh my god. Okay, so,
a slight change of plans. Yeah, we realized
that it'd be awfully useful if we could just stay on this train
and go to Nagano. Exactly. So we're just gonna ask
if his nearest Shinkansen line is the same as our
nearest Shinkansen line. There's a little bit of weirdness in that the Jōetsu and
the Hokuriku Shinkansens run on the same little part
that we're showing on the map. But we are on the Hokuriku line,
so that would be the closest. Mhm. So let's—
Okay, send it? Yeah, I think
we should hit it. Hit it. Oof, okay. Sam and Adam have asked me
whether my nearest Shinkansen is the same as their
nearest Shinkansen, and the answer is... Just kidding! Randomize. Pew! We're hitting them
with the randomize. I do think that this question
is going to tell them a lot. And so I think that it is
worth the randomize. Because they're probably
going to ask it again, and I would like to stall. And I just do not want them
to know that information, and so I would like to delay it
as long as possible. We got a randomize. Well, he has
randomized the question. It sure looks suspicious. I mean, I will tell you, yesterday,
I used the randomize, and I didn't like
what was being asked. Yeah, okay, well, let's see... what we end up
asking him, shall we? Random number,
one to ten. Two.
Two. Is your train service
the same? Well, it's almost certainly not,
unless he's on the Shinkansen. So it randomized into
the train service question, which is actually really good, because that question is
totally useless right now. No, I am not off of that Shinkansen. But it is useful later,
and now they have already asked it. So they could ask it again later,
but for double the price. Let's go ahead and tell them
that I am not on a Shinkansen. Oh, shocker, no.
He's not on our train line, great. I think we just ask it again. It's the best question.
Yeah, I agree. And, you know,
it's at the original cost. Yeah, yeah,
because it doesn't count as us having asked that question.
Okay, well, we'll ask it again. But now he gets basically
two really good card pulls instead of one for having
answered that question. Because he got that one
basically for free. Yeah. It's gotta be the same. Well, but maybe...
Fake out? Well, what I'm like is like,
maybe he is down here, and he wanted to make us
keep going in the wrong direction as long as possible. Maybe.
You know? And, of course... now that I've answered that very useless question of theirs,
I get to look at the top three, draw one, pretty good. Five minute bonus.
Curse of the Cairn. Curse of the Cairn. You have one attempt
to stack as many rocks on top of each other
as you can in a freestanding tower. Once your tower falls, the Seekers must
construct a rock tower of the same number of rocks
before asking another question. Or a ten minute bonus. I do like Curse of the Cairn. If I really take some time
to stack some rocks, I feel like I could get a really... nice and tall rock tower. They've asked
the same question again. Am I near that Shinkansen? No, I am not near that Shinkansen.
You know what I am near? I'm near the teddy bear museum. The teddy bear museum. Before we go into the
teddy bear museum, one last order of business,
which is to... draw one more card off of the
nearest Shinkansen question. Okay, look at the top three.
Five minute bonus. Veto question.
Discard two, draw three. Go ahead and keep that veto.
Might be useful down the line. Oh my god, it's already so cute. They got the
Teddy Garden cookie factory, and they've got the museum. Okay, this is my favorite place
in the whole world. Welcome to the Teddy Bear Museum. They have a lot of teddy bears here
is one of my first observations. (gasps)
(classical music playback) No.
No. Well... Well, look,
that's good to know. It is. So we should
get off at Takasaki. Yeah. Okay, here's what
I think we should do now. Thermometer. Thermometer.
Yeah. Because then, we'll have it
down to the two Shinkansens. Yeah, okay.
We start it... Probably, ASAP.
Oh yeah, we're not that far. We might, honestly, for time,
we might need to use our 5. Do we?
Because it's only 25 miles, and we need the time
for a response. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
We gotta do it now. Let's start the 5. (scoffs)
They keep asking me questions. Stop asking me questions. I just want to enjoy
the Teddy Bear Museum. They've started a Thermometer. Okay. It's fine, it's fine. Okay. These teddy bears are
making teddy bears. Which I feel like has some
complicated... implications. I guess we're probably
not supposed to be thinking about that so much
at the Teddy Bear Museum. I think it's fine for teddy bears
to make other teddy bears. Oh. They're giving this bear an MRI. The MRI machine is broken. That bear is going to die
from a horrible disease. So is this angle even
going to do it, for sure? Oh, I guess, maybe not. Oh, yeah, that's not
quite going to get there. But I think we
just need to end this. Okay.
Because of... Because it won't
change meaningfully. Okay, okay.
We need five minutes or so. We shouldn't have
done that Thermometer, because actually we're getting
off of Takasaki anyway. Yeah.
That was silly. Oh, they have a giant Catbus. They have a giant Catbus. I have no idea how much
Sam and Adam have me narrowed down at this point. We're early in the day.
We're early in the day. We do gotta waste
more of their time. I'm thinking that we do... We wanna play Curse of the Cairn...
as soon as we can. And the Jammed Door
Curse. Okay. They finished their Thermometer.
Where'd they go? Their Thermometer was colder, but I think it's
actually really close. Which is good, 'cause it's like, you want to be right on
the edge of those lines. Cause it's gonna make them not quite sure
which direction to go. We coulda done better.
We shoulda waited. If we had waited, we coulda
gotten a better line. Well, Ben says colder. Which is quite the
interesting answer. That kind of implies to me that maybe he's in
Shin-Fuji or something. 'Cause that's a...
Theoretically that... It's a tiny area
with almost nothing in it. I mean, okay, we need to
start getting accurate about a lot of our lines here.
Yeah. I mean, probably the
level of accuracy that requires more phone stuff. Yeah, okay. Well, we need
to get off anyway. We need to get off
and turn around, it would seem. I mean, this is
kind of that phase where it's like,
did we (bleep) up? Or do we have it narrowed
down quite a lot? Should we just look
for the nearest... for the soonest back to Tokyo, or... Probably, right? I mean, at this point, maybe. Honestly, maybe
we should do a Radar just to double check
that he's not... Yeah, radar could be useful.
You know what I mean? A 50 mile Radar
even would be smart. Yeah, maybe. Let's focus on getting
off this train and... Yeah, okay, okay.
That is a crazy answer. That might mean that
he's at Mount Fuji or near Mount Fuji.
Yeah. Okay. We're leaving
the Teddy Bear Museum. We had good fun.
We are enriched. We had a lovely time.
But now, it's down to business. I get to draw... two cards off of that Thermometer. Let's take a look-see. Okay, top two. Curse the Endless Tumble. Curse of the Endless Tumble. Seekers must roll a die
at least 100 feet and have it land on 5 or 6 before they can ask
another question. Casting cost: Roll a die. If it's a 5 or a 6,
this card has no effect. Curse of Spotty Memory. Curse of Spotty Memory. For the rest of your run,
one random category of questions will be disabled at all times. Casting cost: Discard a time bonus. Two Curses. Curse of the Endless Tumble,
it's okay. That might be
kind of annoying for them. Or Curse of the Spotty Memory. I don't see that
being that annoying, and you have to discard
a time bonus to do that, so... I'm going to take the other one
and I'm just going to try it now. That's crazy. In my mind that was
just a double check. Yeah. It was like,
well let's just make sure. But I suppose that's
why you double check. Three minutes to
make this connection. Okay. Was this the third round in a row
that people have started off by going the wrong way?
Yep. I mean the thing is... If we were right
about our work... we've actually
narrowed it down a ton. Right, unless we're wrong. We actually have an
extremely tight area. Yeah. I think we should do
a 50 mile Radar just to make sure that... we haven't (bleep)-ed up
somehow or something. And also to eliminate the tiny area
that could still be around here. 'Cause then we have
a very precise area to head to. I think so. Yeah, I think
that would cover it. Should we hit it?
Yeah, we should hit it. Oh? They've just done a Radar. Okay, let's do this first,
and then we'll deal with that Radar. Okay, so we roll a die. And we gotta roll a 1, 2, 3, or 4
for it to take effect. Alright... got it. So, let's go ahead and
hit 'em with the Curse. Of the Endless Tumble. Okay, now we've hit 'em
with that Curse, they've asked a 50 mile Radar. It's a miss. So, we'll let them know about that,
and we'll draw another two cards. They're asking a lot of questions. Curse of the Luxury Car. Curse of the Luxury Car.
Take a photo of a car. The seekers must take a photo
of a more expensive car before asking another question. Or a 10 minute bonus. Fact of the matter is, I'm not gonna find
an expensive car out here. It's not gonna happen. So, I'm taking the 10 minute
bonus for now, but maybe... that's gonna be sort of
good discard fodder for the Jammed Door Curse later. Okay. Sorry, that was complicated.
We're all good now. They got a Curse on them,
so it's gonna take them a minute. While they deal with that... Let's go find some rocks
to set up our next Curse. The... The Curse of the Cairn. Miss, okay.
It's a miss. So that's gotta mean... that he's down there.
I mean, again... correct me if I'm getting
anything wrong here. No, that sounds right.
But I think this is alright. Which means he has to be
in this tiny area here. Well, the line being
that close to Shin-Fuji could be influential. Because... I think he's in Itō.
I'm putting him, I guess, now. I think he's in Itō
down by the beach. It's going to be fun to have
all the footage of us going, ""Well, there's— He's definitely
not down there, though. What are the odds
that he's down there?"" I wonder if we want to ask
some more photos while we're at it. Because...
Maybe. The one thing
about photos is just... it's good to ruminate on them. You know what
I actually want to ask? Mhm? I kind of want to ask
biggest body of water. Because a lot of these are... Oop, Curse of the Endless Tumble. That's really
not a very good curse. Curse of the Endless Tumble. Seekers must roll a die
at least 100 feet and have it land on a 5 or 6 before they can ask
another question. The die must roll
the full distance, unaided, using only the momentum
from the initial throw and gravity to travel the 100 feet. If the Seekers accidentally
hit someone with the die, the Hider is awarded
a 15 minute bonus. No. Roll a die
at least 100 feet. Oh, I guess we can't
really do that on a train. No, that's the
only thing about it. But, at this point, we could just head
all the way to Shin-Fuji. Yeah, yeah,
let's just go ahead and get over there, I guess. I mean, if we're
confident about our work... there's not much we need
to know before we get there. Okay, then let's
just make the connection and get over there.
Yeah. Ugh. Here's my plan. When Sam and Adam
complete this Curse, I want to hit 'em
with a double whammy. First, I'm gonna start
the Jammed Door Curse. Then, I'm gonna hit 'em
with Curse of the Cairn. So that they gotta go out
and build a rock tower. And them having to go
out and about with the Jammed Door Curse is
not only gonna make it possible that they get locked out of
a train or a train station, but that they get locked out of any number of places
that they're trying to go, while they try and clear
this other Curse. They're doing quite well. We're only about three hours in, and I think they've got
my area pretty small. So, I need this
combination of Curses to really slow them down. Time will tell. Alright. There should be one
leaving in seven minutes. Okay. So get off at...
Does this stop at Atami? Oh, I guess this
does stop at Atami. Oh, yeah. Get off at Atami then, maybe.
I guess Atami makes sense. It has the vibe
of where he would go. Yeah, it's a strong
leading option, I agree. So, okay, get off at Atami?
Yeah, I think so. Oh, god, oh. They're going all the way
down to Atami. This is not good for me, okay? That is not good. From Atami, it does not
take that long to get to me. I'm really relying on these Curses
to save me at this point. I just need them to clear
this die rolling Curse first. As soon as they do it, you know, I've got two Curses
to hit them with. Two good Curses
to hit them with. But... They're getting awfully close. Adam. Adam.
Yeah? If you look out the window... the mountain type stuff
around here definitely matches his photo. Kind of in shape. Let's see if we can... Yeah, totally.
See this kind of stuff? Yeah, for sure. It's the same tree type. Definitely. Oh, I'm so sweaty. Ohh. And I can't leave the woods.
I can't leave the woods. I've gotta be here. Because when
they clear this Curse, I need to be able to
build a rock tower. And this is where I gotta be
to build a rock tower. Because where are the rocks?
They're here. The rock tower.
The rock tower is my only hope. They're almost to Atami Station.
What's going on? What's going on?
We need an update. Where are you, Adam Chase?
Where are you, Sam Denby? It's toasty! Yeah. We need to find a
big, nice, open space. Yes.
Flat, open, et cetera. Well, because
we need to make sure we don't hit anyone.
Yeah. I mean, ideally,
we want an incline. Yeah. Before we roll, and as we search, we should probably
prep our next question. So that we can ask it
before he Curses us again. I agree, I mean... This is not bad. Yeah. Actually, let's
cross the street there. Okay. I would say that I'm torn between
we could do a Radar... but again, that wouldn't
give us a direction. I kinda want a picture of
his biggest body of water, because I think whether
or not it's the ocean, it'll tell us if he's on the coast.
Yeah, but honestly, so much of it is
the ocean anyways. Well, not really, though.
I mean, look. There's this whole line
that isn't on the ocean that he could be on. There's this line that
isn't on the ocean that he could be on.
Are you looking? Yeah, I saw.
There's three main lines. But then there's sort of
three that are in the ocean, so it kinda cuts things in half. I mean, the only thing I
don't like about coastal is that... I strongly agree that I think
he's on a coastal route. And therefore, I think
it's going to be... confirming what we largely suspect. It's fine.
I mean, no. If you like ocean,
I think we can do ocean. I worry that it might be a little inefficient
as a question, but... I mean, I guess
it would be like, if we don't ask ocean,
what do we ask? I mean, I always like
Strava map. Yeah, but I mean, look,
all of these towns. They have too many roads.
Okay, fine, let's do ocean. Okay, but we
have to do this first. I believe, based on
their movements on the map, that they are trying
to clear the Curse that I Cursed them with. I don't know. I guess I just hope
it takes a long time. I hope they're struggling. I hope they're cursing. I hope they're arguing. I hope they decide to
sabotage each other over how dramatic
a disagreement they're having over this Curse is. But probably not.
It's probably a pretty easy one. They have, at least this season,
had pretty bad luck with dice. So that's kinda what
I'm going off of. I'm just hoping that
the dice are not rolling in their favor this season. That's 100? That's what it says. I mean, I— Okay.
Well, let's try it. Ah. So that went
straight into the road. Yeah, that just
bounced right out. This might be trickier
than I expected. I think we might
need to find an incline. Maybe. We might need to go
to a park or something. Let's look at
that street up there. Alright, ready?
Yep. Didn't make it there.
I'm gonna try again. Oh, that's not bad. Not bad. It's in the street. Uh-oh. It doesn't feel like
it's gonna work. I kinda think we might
need to switch to grass. I mean, that would work great,
but I think cars use it quite a lot. Yeah. Eh... I don't know, I mean—
It's possible. There's not a lot of
people on the road. We try it while
there's no cars. Let me go down there. Okay, go for it. Ready?
Yep. Oh, come on, come on,
come on. Oh, nope. Didn't make it. That went far enough. Nope. Not far enough. This is definitely taking
longer than I thought it would. Not ideal. You know,
I can't say for sure... but it appears on the map like they are struggling a lot. I can't be sure about this. But it does seem like they may not be
having the best time. Is that true? Ooh, that is just far enough. Nope. Nope. Really?! Yeah, this is tough luck. Come on! It's a good roll,
it's a good roll. Come on! Oh, it went down. No? It was— It's good. Can you see it? It's good. It's down the grate, but good. Wait, we got it?
Yeah. Ho-hoay! No cars. Okay.
Okay, so really quickly. Curse cleared. Well, we have to tell Ben
that we've cleared it, and then we will ask... for the photo of
the biggest body of water. Alright, you texting? Okay, the time has come. They have cleared their Curse,
and they've asked for a photo of my biggest body of water. So here's what I'm gonna do. First things first,
I'm vetoing that question. I ain't sending them that picture. That is just, it's gonna give away
way too much information. Second thing, I'm hitting them
with the Jammed Door Curse. They're moving around too easy.
It's time to jam those doors. And finally, it is time
to build the rock tower. I do not know how much
that is going to delay them, but I feel like if I build
a really good rock tower... then... Oh my god, there's a
little worm flying around. Is he attached to me? Alright, well, Ben... Oh, we got Cursed again. Curse of the Jammed Door. Curse of the Jammed Door. For the next three hours, whenever the Seekers want
to pass through a doorway into a building, business,
train, or other vehicle, they must first roll two dice. If they do not roll seven or higher,
they cannot enter that space. Any given doorway can be
reattempted after 15 minutes. Thank god we just
walked into the train station. Oh, yeah. We'll, of course,
have to roll to get on a train. Yeah, in the last
three hours, again? The next three hours.
Let's find somewhere to sit down. We're about to get the picture, and we need to figure out
what to do after that. Yep. My guess is that
he cast that just now because the photo is
going to be of the ocean. Yeah.
And he knows that's damning. Yep, it definitely is. Yeah, because I think at that point,
our choice is basically, do we go down or do we go across?
Yeah. This is the Itō Line, by the way.
Oh yeah. We could just
roll for it right now. I mean, we could.
I don't hate it. I mean, we might as well do it.
Wanna just do it? Yeah.
Alright, here you go. What am I rolling for?
Seven or more. Three and three. Not quite. So we're not
getting this conversion. Okay, well, you know,
it's interesting that we checked. Yeah. Ohh, he vetoed.
He's vetoed. What's the penalty
of that again? If we ask it again,
it would cost double. Let's... I think maybe Strava map. You wanna Strava map him? I mean, I feel like if he's on
one of these stations... Yeah.
There's only one, two, three, four. Yeah, let's Strava map him.
Let's see what we learn. Let's make him run around. Because we have to sit
around for a while anyway before we can
do much, I think. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good solid base. Alright. Rock number two. I feel like this might
sort of fit well. Gonna have to get a little smaller. Okay. Rock number four. Okay. I like the flatness of this one.
Ooh, yeah. It's a little risky,
but I think it could... I think it could be a big win. Nope, okay. That's nine. That is nine. I mean, right now,
I think they're thinking, ""Oh man, this Jammed Door Curse.
So annoying."" Well, just wait until they hear that they have to build a tower
that is nine rocks tall. They've asked for the Strava map. So that's the last question
that they're getting before they get hit with
the Curse of the rock tower. We've been Cursed. Sam, we have been hit
with the Curse of the Cairn! Curse of the Cairn. The Seekers must
construct a rock tower of the same number of rocks
as the one the Hider built before asking another question. Yep, and... He got nine. Which feels like a lot. I do feel like
that feels like a lot. Okay, should we go
and try to clear this? Because here's the thing. If we leave the station, we'll have to roll to
get back in the station. I think we should at least wait to get the Strava map.
Sure. Because maybe we can
confirm it on the Strava map. Sure. And then just get on the
next train after this one. And then do it wherever he is because we know he did it there.
Where we know there are rocks. Because I don't think
there are going to be very good rocks around here.
Because it's very urban. Yeah. Okay, okay. Alright, I'll wait. Okay. Starting the Strava map. I think I'm gonna try and go
in a big circle, more or less. Okay. I think... that is it. Hopefully, they don't figure it out. Eh. Alright, we have
our Strava map. It is... It does not scream
dense place. No.
I'll tell you that. Especially when you
consider that that's a half mile. Yeah, I mean,
these places are big enough that Strava's not easy. I don't know, I don't know if we're
gonna get it on the Strava map. Yeah, seems unlikely. Amusement—
There are quite a number of amusement parks around here. Mhm.
Just saying. I think that... Tentacles, Sam, would
not be crazy at all. Yeah. (sighs) We might have to start
looking for some rocks. Okay, it looks like they... they did not get on
that next train to me. Which is good.
It either means... they got screwed by a Curse, or...
they don't yet know where I am. At least not confidently enough
to get on a train, but... They could still get here
in a little over an hour if they figure it out, so... I'm gonna keep looking
for a hiding spot. I'm kind of just wandering around
looking for something that is as boring as I can find. And that is...
a surprisingly difficult task. Keep your eyes peeled
if we pass anywhere that's got some good rocks. You sure it's this way?
It says this way. I'm walking towards
what looks like a bunch of rocks on the beach
in the satellite. Oh, here's some rocks. No, definitely not enough.
Okay. Well, oh, there's more here. I don't think this is enough.
Well, you want to try? Well, that's barely nine. Let's try real quick. I guess.
Give— Hold the camera. Let me have two minutes. Here, hold this.
Just let me cook. Two. Three. Four. That's five. There are a bunch
of rocks over there. Rocks over here?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we
can grab a few of these. Put them back. Yeah, I mean,
you need something flatter. For the top one?
Yeah. There we go.
Three more. One, two, three,
four, five, six, right? If we start going to smaller rocks,
I think we could really get there. Yeah. Seven. Oh. Seven.
It's really unstable. I know, but we can just do
teeny baby ones now. That's true.
Right? It's so—
Make sure to support it as— I'd say support it
as you put it on. Okay. This— Is this a rock? I think that's wood. That's a rock. This is a rock for sure. Do we need to
beat it or equal it? We have to just equal it. One, two, three,
four, five. Nine rocks.
Okay, there we go. Cuh, cuh, yeah?
No, that was good. Did— did you—
You didn't believe me that I could do the rocks? Questioned me from
the moment we started? I mean... I think that we... We've cleared it and now
I think we do a Tentacles. And I think we probably do it
with amusement parks. I mean,
feel free to hit it quick because I want to get first. I'm going to do
amusement park Tentacles. Okay, let's head back
to the train station so that we can start rolling
and try to get in. Okay, oh my goodness. They've just cleared their... the Curse of the Cairn.
Good rock stacking, boys. Very, very efficient. More efficient than
I would have liked. But then they've gone ahead
and deployed a Tentacles on me. An amusement park Tentacles.
And what's interesting about that... is that I am just outside of the 15 mile range of
that Tentacles, which... is either going to
confuse them a lot if they were assuming I was
definitely within that 15 miles, or if they've done
their work correctly... they'll know exactly where I am. Which is not great. Hopefully, it at least
scares them a little bit, because maybe they'll think
they've made a mistake. There's a chance
they've made a mistake, or I'm here. But they have wasted a
decent amount of time, they have missed quite
a few trains to me, and I don't think that
they're going to be able to get here until 3-ish now. I also now get to... look at the top four cards
and draw two, which is real big. That's a lot of cards. 15 minute bonus.
30 minute bonus. Discard two, draw three.
Discard one, draw two. So, honestly,
45 free minutes is awesome. Anyway, they now probably
know exactly where I am. So, let's keep looking
for a hiding place. Adam, do we want to consider planning a next question
for as soon as he responds, in case he's gonna follow up with a Curse that he maybe
just pulled or something? It's possible. I think between this and the Strava,
I think we might be able to find it. Well, yeah, but we have
already looked at those lines. I guess. I feel like we'd at
least want a photo, right? Maybe.
I mean, at least with... Ben is not within
15 miles of us, Sam. Oh boy, that's not good. Well, I mean, that
narrows things down. I guess let's look at what's not within
15 miles of here, but still. It's pretty limited. Alright, here we go, ready? Hey!
There we go. First time. Okay, well,
not within 15 miles is... Probably.
Sure interesting. I mean, it's probably
quite helpful. Yeah, we just have to sit down
and figure out what it means. Yeah, just... I'm worried that maybe we've
just missed something massively. We should also assume that the lines we've drawn
are slightly off. Yes. Okay. So what does that mean? So it basically
means he's not south. 'Cause combining 15 miles with the furthest
he could have gotten... Yeah.
You know. He could not be on
the line to Itō. I'm starting to think the only thing
he could be on is this. Yeah, we probably need to—
Yeah, that line looks plausible. What's he at right now? Time wise? Six and a half hours.
Yeah. But that's not
including time bonuses. Yeah, so to be confident,
we probably need to get him in the next two hours or so.
We need to— Yeah, we need to get cooking here. I mean, is it— Do we—
Is there any sense in moving? Oh, there's one in...
(bleep) two minutes. To where? To the direction we want to go.
Okay, well, let's try it. Okay, we're gonna
have to roll for it. Yep. Here's my guess as to what is happening
right now. I think that Sam and Adam
have me pegged down to one station, and it's this one. And they can't quite... work up the gumption
to come here because they haven't
yet confirmed it. They only have all of the... pieces of data pointing at it. But they don't have a thing
that they can just look at and be like,
that's definitely the place. And if they can't... well, then they might just
have to take a gamble. I don't know. Here, quickly roll for it.
Yeah. No, can't even get on it.
So it doesn't matter. Oh, well there's
one 2:13 on this way. Platform 3. Okay, well let's
go roll for that. It's just that one. Alright. Five, six, that's an 11.
Should we get on? Yeah.
Alright. So... I feel like right now... we gotta ask a photo
or something. I'm not convinced
the photo's gonna get us much. I mean, they often— It's always— It's often
a situation where it's not the direct thing
they get you. It's the indirect thing. Let's do tallest building
from the train station, 'cause that's always
a good one to have for when we go through
his station eventually. Send it?
Yeah. Ugh. They want the tallest building
from the train station. Will this give it away? I do not know. I do not know. Sam seemed pretty good at
figuring it out last time. Okay, we are back at
the train station. And this is definitely
the tallest thing. We have to send
the tallest building ...that is not the train station. So I believe... it is that thing up there.
Let us take a picture of this. It's pretty distinctive. I hope that that does not give
away too much information, but, we'll see. Let me put you down
for a second. Five minute bonus.
Whatev-ah. Whatev-ah. Five minutes is five minutes.
I'll take it. What is that?
Oh, that's unique. That, I mean, we could
find that building if we found the town. And very modern, very fancy.
Very modern. That's gotta be
somewhere touristy. It's got that fancy of a building. Here, hold this for a second. Let me just look up...
What prefecture are we in? Could we ask about
prefecture actually? Do you want to just
do the Radar first? I like a Radar just to be like, are we even in the right
ballpark at this point? Yeah. So far we have no
confirmation that we are. I guess let's wait a minute
and see if we can match the photo. It looks like a rest—
I mean a restaurant. I mean my only other
thought would be... a university style thing,
but I think restaurant. I'm thinking small and touristy. I kinda feel like another photo. This photo is so distinctive. Yeah, I want to drop
a 25 mile Radar just to make sure we're not way off.
Sure, yeah. No, it's worth it because
I think they're, it's plenty. Does that definitely encompass
everything that we want? Okay, cool, send it. (clears throat) Sorry, I was just sitting here trying to reorganize my cables
before I went back out to go find a hiding place
again, but... Sam and Adam have just... have gone to Mishima and asked for a 25 mile Radar. It is a hit.
I'm within 25 miles of Mishima. But that is not the right way. They were— They coulda
come straight down here. So I think that they must
be missing something. I'm just not sure
what that thing is. They're gonna have to
untangle this mystery pretty soon, or... or this is going to
become the winning run. Clock is ticking, boys.
Clock is ticking. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus (sighs) This is not
going well for us, Sam. Adam, I'm really scared. We never get to the ad read
when we're this far away. I know. We need to find Ben. If you guys want to see
Adam and Sam continue to suffer, you can watch the next episode
right now by heading on over to our streaming service, Nebula. You hear that?
I feel like I heard something. It sounded like somebody
was making the pitch for an incredible streaming
service called Nebula where you could see
the next episode right now because we put up
every episode early. Why would
someone be doing that? I don't know.
I mean, Nebula sounds pretty neat. But I sure wish that
it had an aftershow where you could hear us
discussing what happened in the latest episode of Jet Lag. I love listening to us yap.
Yeah. Well, actually, if you
watch Jet Lag on Nebula, you can listen to our
aftershow podcast, The Layover, where we get into the nitty-gritty
and behind-the-scenes and all that good stuff. And it's the definitive way
of watching Jet Lag: The Game. Do you not think
these vague sounds of promoing a niche streaming site
full of original content... Doesn't that kind of
seem like a sign that ...Ben could be close? I don't know.
We could pop down a Radar. All this talk about
this streaming service is making me wonder. Does it have other things on it
that you could watch? Not just our show and podcast? Can you—
Why are you talking— We need to focus. Well, actually, we have a bunch of other
awesome stuff on Nebula, like The Getaway,
which was a competitive reality travel show
that we made, it was really fun. We also made a bunch
of documentaries. And also, all of your other
favorite creators are on there making content that is ad-free,
often early, often extended, and some of it is
completely original, like great shows from
RealLifeLore, Real Engineering,
and so many others. Should we do a... We could do a Radar. We could do a Thermometer.
See if we can find him. But while we sort of
make our call on that, I do wonder how you would sign up
for this streaming service. Why do you keep
bringing this up? So basically, if you go ahead and you go to
nebula.tv/jetlag, you can sign up
and get 40% off. It's the best way to get
a great deal on Nebula and also to support us,
because when you use our code, then we get some extra money
to keep making the show. So we would really appreciate if you used our code
when you signed up. (smooches) Maybe we missed a train line? Yeah, we should
probably look into it."

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","8Xdl5psYVgQ","It's 7:30 am,
the game day just started, and I'm in my hiding spot. And I've done something
that I think is... so dumb that
it might just be genius. I've come to the airport! Welcome to episode three of our six day game of
hide-and-seek across Japan. After finding Ben in the
mountain town of Yamadera and Adam in the forests
by Tobiyama Castle, now it's my turn to see
if I can set a winning time. As a reminder, in this game,
the Hider has three and a half hours to get to a hiding spot. Then, the Seekers gain information
about the Hider's location by choosing questions
from the question menu. I, the Hider, have
to answer truthfully, but in exchange, I get cards
that can help me slow them down. So, without further ado,
let's go to Ben and Adam, starting where we
found Adam yesterday as they try to track me down. Alright. Good morning from the woods. It is 7:30 am, and that means
that it's time to find Sam. Let's go get him. Alright, so, first things first,
we gotta figure out which direction we are gonna go. Are we going up the country
or are we going down the country? Well, I'd say
the first direction we need to go is
sort of out of the woods. Well, we do need
to get out of the woods. Yeah, when
we get to Utsunomiya, we can either go
back up northeast, right, towards where you hid
on that Shinkansen. Or we can go down towards
Ōmiya and Tokyo area. Yeah. Ben, I would love
to find one question that can tell us
which way to go and that doesn't require us to move a lot to do so. Okay, here's my logic. So, this game rewards risk because the winner
is the longest run. It doesn't matter. Adam's run from yesterday?
Meaningless. Because it didn't—
It wasn't longest. I don't think you're
gonna get the longest run, or at least have the best shot
of getting the longest run, by kinda just doing
the same thing. And there were plenty
of options that I saw that would have been more or less the same
kind of location profile. Small- to medium-sized town, you know, an hour to
two hours on Shinkansen, then transferring
onto a smaller line. The thing is,
you're required in this game to center your location
on a train station. And basically,
every single train station in the entire country serves a town, a city, a village, some population center. And therefore,
that's kinda what you expect when you answer or
ask the questions. But the train station here? It doesn't serve a town.
It serves an airport. So my guess is that... the answers are going to be
really confusing to Ben and Adam. And this is massive.
There's three terminals. Each terminal has – even just in the publicly
accessible area before security that I'm allowed to go into – there's a bajillion different
meandering locations. I'm gonna have a while
to be able to look around and find a good spot. I could be completely wrong. I mean, I have no idea.
I mean, I've never— Nobody has ever tried
something like this. But, maybe it works out?
Maybe this really confuses them? We'll see. Okay, well, we've made it
back to the station. There's a light rail soon.
So, so far, we are killing it. Sam, you're toast.
Alright, Ben. I actually think that I have
a really good solution here. We can do a matching question about if his nearest major
international airport is the same as our nearest
major international airport. The reason that's good is... we are closest to
Narita Airport here. But Haneda Airport is right here. But what's good is there are no other major
international airports in the whole top half
of the country. So if he says, ""Yes, we share
the same closest airport,"" we know he's closest to here.
Which means he's up here. He's this way, right?
Yeah. If the answer's no... then we know he can't
be anywhere up here. He has to be closer to Haneda
or to one of the other ones, to Osaka or whatever, Nagoya. I mean, that certainly
gives us a direction to go. I quite like that.
Okay. I say we go for it.
Let's hit him with it. Sam's never gonna
see this one coming. Alright, I've come to hang out
in the massage chairs because it's already
very hot outside. Okay, first question. Ironically, it is... is your closest major
international airport the same as ours? So, as you can imagine,
that question freaked me out a bit, but I chose to believe that
it was just a coincidence. Just because they asked me
about my nearest airport didn't mean they knew
I was at the airport. However, you, the audience,
do know I'm at the airport. And now you know
it's Narita Airport, which means we're gonna do
something a bit unusual this round. Boop, there I am!
Now, let's see how they do. Alright.
I am sending them their answer. This will definitely
give them some direction. Alright.
Okay. We got our answer.
Well that is very interesting. It's the same. So it means
the man's gone north. Well it means
he's gone north or... I mean there's, this is possible. Right, he could have gone
maybe to Niigata somehow. Yeah, but it's unlikely. I will say, here's
what I will say, Adam. I know that Sam was very bothered
by the weather yesterday. Sure. He might have been trying
to go as far north as possible. I bet Adam didn't
have a massage function in the middle of
the woods yesterday. First card pull of the round, so... One. Two. Oops. Okay, so I got
Curse of the Endless Tumble, a 15 minute bonus,
and a 15 minute bonus. Curse of the Endless Tumble. Seekers must roll a die
at least 100 feet and have it land on 5 or 6 before they can ask
another question. Casting cost: Roll a die. If it's a 5 or a 6,
this card has no effect. I don't think
this is gonna cost them more than 15 minutes,
to be honest. I think I'm just gonna keep
the 15 minute time bonus. I'm gonna get a massage now. Oh my god, the seat's
going backwards. Ohh. That's nice. That's very nice. Oh man, that's a great start. You love to see it. (paper flaps) In terms of the
complexity of what's happening, nowhere here,
none of this, none of... This is much simpler to deal with. Sam is not going to be
pleased about that at all. No. Ooh, it's getting my butt now. Oh! (chuckles) Oh, it's hitting my butt. Oh yeah. Oh! Alright. Welcome back to beautiful
Utsunomiya Station. Ben, look, I don't
want to jinx anything, but I would make the argument that Sam going that direction
was stupid of him. No, he's cooked. It's been— This round
is basically over. Okay, so I think just hop on
a Shinkansen headed north. Yep.
And go from there. Yeah. We'll need to do some stuff
to figure out a few things. I think maybe we go up
a little bit on the Shinkansen and hit him with a
100 mile Radar because that would include Niigata.
Yeah. So then we would know
if it's a miss, we don't have to worry about that. I think he's— he probably
went further than that. Probably. I wonder where
Ben and Adam think I am. Because I think it's just... I think it's just so unintuitive.
Hopefully. Maybe the one big risk of
going here is that, you know, I'm sure the first comments
on this are going to be like, ""Oh, of course
he went to the airport."" Because everyone thinks
that I've made an entire career off of airport content.
Which is, I guess, kind of true. I mean, this game is called
Jet Lag: The Game, and I made... and my other
channel became popular because of videos about
airplanes and stuff. Ooh, it's gettin' the butt again. What am I eating? I don't know.
Oh, it's good, though. It's pretty good, though. Alright, a Shinkansen
will be here in a few minutes. Given that we just have
a little bit of time right now, feels like the thing to do
is to ask for a picture. 'Cause the 15 minutes
it takes to send it won't annoy us at all. You know, we could do
the five buildings. We could do... We could do widest street,
which we haven't done yet. Because five buildings
is easier to manipulate. Widest street, which you
have to shoot a picture across the widest street,
I think tells us quite a lot about how urban it is. Well, it'll tell us
if there's a highway in the middle of a city,
stuff like that. Alright, I say we do that.
Yeah. What is that?
I don't know. There's a lot of goo
coming out. There's a lot of goo.
It's mostly goo. Alright, massage is over. I'll almost certainly be back,
but I've been sent on a mission. Need to get a photo
of the widest street. The photos, honestly,
are the ones I'm worried about. Gotta move fast to get
to the spot on time. Okay, seems like the
widest street is not here, but there's a wider one kind of
in the middle of the parking area. Okay, I'm gonna be honest.
I just noticed that. And if they ask tallest building
visible from the train station, I am cooked. Alright, Ben.
We are heading up towards Sendai. This train stops at... Sendai, Fukushima,
Koriyama, and... in the Snack Zone. Welcome to The Snack Zone.
It's a show within a show where we review
Japan's greatest snacks. Or just other stuff
that we find. Today we are having ekibens. I got this one with
an angry chicken. I got the nice chicken. Oh yeah, yours is better. That's why you stick
with the nice chicken. Alright, this street here...
seems to be the answer. Mostly 'cause...
most of them have a median. This one doesn't have a median. I'm going to take one
right across from here. I don't think it's going
to be tremendously helpful. The main thing that'll tell them is I'm probably not in
a very small place. Okay, now that that's done,
let me pull my card. Curse... of the
Impressionable Consumer. Curse of the
Impressionable Consumer. The Seekers must buy a product
that they saw an advertisement for before asking another question. Casting cost: The Seekers'
next question is free. Okay, that's pretty good. Ooh, this is awesome. Looks like they took
a Shinkansen north. They probably did a 50-50 gamble
and went north. And that is the wrong direction. Oh, Ben. It's a pretty wide street.
That's a pretty wide street. So he can't be
somewhere that small. No. There's not a street like that
where I hit, certainly. You know where there
is a street like that? Where?
All along the coast. I would not be surprised
if he was on the coast. When do we want to
hit him with the Radar? When we get to... Nasushiobara.
Nasushiobara. Yeah, I think if
we hit him with that, we'll be sitting pretty. So, I've got a theory
of a hiding spot... that I want to check out.
And I'll explain it. But first, I have to
be able to find it. Man, I'm thinking about
how tremendously cooked I am if they ask the
tallest building thing. The tallest building visible from any entrance of
the train station. The control tower is
definitely, definitely visible. So if they can identify that, they can figure out with
pretty good confidence that I'm in an airport. And they already know
my closest airport is Narita. Alright, Ben,
we are in Nasushiobara. Yay. Let's hit him
with the Radar. 100 miles. I mean, it could sink it. Boy, we'll have gotten
the area down real quick. Real quick. Alright, just got hit by
100 mile Radar. Let me see. Alright, I'm about 90 miles away
from the 100 mile Radar, so it counts.
So that'll be that. Okay, I'm back at the scene
as far as my last card to pull. One. Two. Ooh. Curse of the Ransom Note. The next question
that the Seekers ask must be composed of
words and letters cut out of any printed material. Casting cost: Spell out
""Curse of the Ransom Note"" as a ransom note. The next question
that the Seekers ask must be composed of
words and letters cut out of any printed material. Or... Randomize question. I think I'm going to keep
randomize question, 'cause if they hit me with
the tallest building thing, I just hit them with
the randomize question. That would be pretty good. Ben... It's a hit.
I would say that a hit is... more annoying in terms of,
what do we do now? If it was a miss, we'd just go up.
Well, yeah. One of the biggest troubles...
is this guy. It's still this.
Niigata. Here's what
I think we should do. Is his nearest Shinkansen line
the same as ours? If the answer's yes,
it means he's in this half. If the answer's no... Niigata or he's doing
something with this. Yeah. I think that there's a decent
chance he's on this coast. Yeah. That's kind of
what I think, too. Okay, how do we feel about that? Yeah, let's do that.
Okay. (zipper opening) And they just asked
yet another question. It was the nearest Shinkansen. And I think the answer is yes? I need to check.
They're really dumping questions on. Oh, it is so close to being a miss. I am literally less than a mile from being closer to
the Tōkaidō Shinkansen. Let me let 'em know.
That's unfortunate. One. Two. Three.
Ten minute bonus. Curse of the Frozen Dot. Curse of the Frozen Dot. Place a point on the map
at least 1,000 feet from where the Seekers are
currently standing. If, in exactly 15 minutes, they are within
250 feet of that point, they are frozen in place
for the next 30 minutes. That's interesting. Five minute bonus. Gotta keep
Curse of the Frozen Dot. I mean, these aren't good bonuses.
Yeah, that's easy. Alright, I'm going exploring. Okay, we got our answer? Okay, yes, yes. So that means that he's
almost certainly... I mean, he could be here,
but he's probably on the east coast. And this is the best place— This is the best
connecting to the east coast. So we should get off here. Yeah, 'cause you can go to Iwaki.
Yeah. Okay.
I bet he's on the coast. Yeah, yeah. Well, we should do
something to confirm it. Here, let's go set up
a shot somewhere. So... The situation is complicated. The area we're dealing with
is so small. But if he is on the coast...
Right. The trains to get there
take so long. Well they take so long, or they don't run.
Like here's what's annoying. Last night he could've
gone up to Koriyama and then over to Iwaki. But those trains only
run in the afternoon. Right, so we can't do that.
We would have to go, I mean... Mother-(bleep)-er. I mean, we just need to
figure out as fast as possible if we need to start making that four or five hour
journey to the coast. Is it really
four or five hours? Okay, wait wait, Ben. If we're doing this,
we need to figure out now because this train doesn't leave
for a long time afterwards. Down to Mito? Yeah.
No, yeah. In fact, we would
have to get on that. I almost think that— We need to go get on it
just as a safety precaution. It's too big of a risk
to not do that. Okay, we need to
ask a question though. You wanna ask about the coast? Yes, I guess coast? I don't know, I mean, I'm searching for
a better idea here. We need to ask— I'm just going to ask
about coastline, Ben. We have to ask something. We have to ask something.
Yeah, I think... It's gotta be coast
or elevation, right? I'm doing coast,
because we can get an answer before we have to get on this train.
Okay. (bleep) I bet you anything
this is what he did. Okay, finally found
a way to Terminal 2. Let me tell you, it is so hard
to navigate these areas. This is gonna suck for them. Alright, another question. They are really...
going heavy with them which might be the right strategy.
Closer or nearer from the coast? Okay, they are 35 miles. I am just 20. Actually less than that
in this direction. I'm just 13 or so. So I'm definitely closer. Okay, another pull. One. Two. Three. Oh, five minutes,
five minutes, five minutes, really?
Three five minutes? Alright, well, I guess
I'll take five minutes. Well, it seems like
our train to Mito is delayed. We just can't tell what's going on
because everything's in Japanese. Closer. Yeah, okay, that's what we thought.
He's gotta... But... bwuh... Okay, what do you reckon?
You want to ask about if he's in the same
prefecture now, maybe? We need to start splitting this up.
Yeah. I mean, actually,
you know what? Maybe the cheaper way
of doing it isn't prefecture. Maybe we ask about—
we do a Radar. Maybe like a...
Like 50. Like a 50. It also could be
the case that he... went all the way down
to the coast down there. You know what I mean? I don't know, man. I mean... But, yeah, no, I think
a 50 mile Radar makes sense. Okay. We gotta start
cutting options down. What a mess, Ben. Okay, well, still searching. Now I have a 50 mile Radar. It's gonna be a miss.
Big miss. I think that's pretty good for me. I don't think it's gonna be... massively influential. Okay. Two, two, two. One, two. Curse of the Zoologist. Curse of the Zoologist. Take a photo of a wild fish, bird,
mammal, reptile, amphibian, or bug. The Seekers must take a picture of a wild animal in
the same category before asking another question. The other one's
a randomize question. I think I'm gonna keep
randomize question. That seems good. Yeah, I'm gonna keep
randomize question. ♫ (jingle over speakers) Oh, it's a jingle. ""Please line up
to board the train."" I mean, as long as it still shows,
I think it's just a little late. Yeah. Miss.
Interesting. Okay, this is
very interesting, Ben. I think that's good.
It's a miss. I would argue that is good. I mean, it's possible he's up— There's this little sliver.
That little sliver. But are there even
train stations in that sliver? Let's check.
Let's check the sliver. I mean, there's the airport.
There's not a lot. Thanks to their train delay,
Ben and Adam had some time to analyze the 50 mile Radar miss and further narrow
down possibilities. Lucky for them, they realized that
the train they were waiting for, that they would have already
been on if it had been on time, would actually get them
to the remaining options much more slowly.
So they shifted gears. But look, Ben.
It would be faster to not take this. Okay, well,
do we want to get on the Shinkansen at 9:30? We gotta decide quickly, because that train's
in three minutes. Let's get on the Shinkansen,
head south Alright, let's go.
...and do a hotter-colder. Do you know what platform
the Shinkansen is on? Nope. Keep going, keep going. Is that it leaving or arriving?
I don't know. Arriving. I think. Yeah! Let's get on this. We gotta act quickly. Wow, we almost made
a pretty big blunder, I would say. That miss is good.
That miss is really good. It would have been, I mean,
pretty freaking tough for us if he had been anywhere in there. Our next stop is more
than 50 miles away. Okay.
So... 50 mile hotter-colder starts now. Good news. I have finally found it. Yeah. See, there's going
to be an underpass. Yeah, there we go. Okay. Oh, wow. This is a long hallway. Okay, they're starting
a 50 mile hotter-colder. Presumably, they're
going to head south then. So, my understanding... is that this is an
old train station. It was Narita Airport's
first train station before it kind of grew big. It's kind of in the
center of everything. That means it's far from
the actual terminals. And you just saw,
it took me an hour to find this entrance. You have to kind of
navigate your way through the back of the
Terminal 2 train station. Wow. This is something. (loud metal scraping) I think this... (metal scraping continues) Can you hear that escalator sound? (scraping becomes intermittent) This is terrifying. There's also
no air conditioning here. The question is, can I
survive hours, potentially? No air conditioning.
Creepy escalator sounds. Alright, that was good intel. I think I'm gonna head back
to the massage chairs. I think I deserve that
after all that. That was a big walk. Alright, Ben, we've
gone 50 miles south. It's time for the hotter colder. Yeah.
All this really tells us is it just makes sure that he's
not in that little Sendai sliver, but I think we need to know that. You can never be too safe. I am drowning in sweat. (giggles softly) It is so humid and hot out. Okay, Ben. He has said that we are hotter,
which is what we expected. Okay.
But it's just good to eliminate that
awful little sliver. He's not in the
sinister Sendai sliver. So there's, at this point,
I think there's only two prefectures he could really be in.
The— What are they, Ben? Ibaraki or Chiba. Fortunately for us,
we're in the Tochigi Prefecture, which ends with I. So if we asked
if his prefecture ends with the same letter as us,
if the answer is yes, it means he's in the
Ibaraki Prefecture. If the answer is no, it means
he's in the Chiba Prefecture. Quite interesting. Which I would say... could be compelling. Very compelling. I will say, I am scared
about the cards that he has. He hasn't used any cards yet, and we've been asking
a lot of questions. No, but here's the other thing. His hand at this point
is probably full, because he hasn't played anything. So, the more questions
we can ask now, while his hand is full, the better. Because that's going to
force him to play stuff when he doesn't want to play it,
or discard stuff. So, let's learn if he's...
which prefecture he's in. Okay, just got another question I haven't even had time
to do the card for yet. I need to catch up! Okay, first... First thing I'm going to do... is... discard my five minute bonus, because that's not useful. Now... I'm going to do... Thermometer:
draw two, pick one. Alright, one. Two, whoop.
Curse of the Right Turn. Curse of the right turn. For the next hour,
the Seekers can only turn right at any street intersection. Casting cost: Discard a Curse
and one other card. And discard two, draw three. I'm gonna keep
Curse of the Right Turn. Alright, now let me answer... Does my prefecture end with I?
No. We got an answer from Sam. What's the answer?
Ben... His prefecture does not end
with the same letter as ours. Ooh. Which means that he is... ...there.
In a tiny little baby area. A little baby area. A little baby area
for little baby Sam. The kind of area that
a sweet little baby might be. Yeah. Mm. Sorry, sweet little baby. Sweet little baby Sam,
we're about to go get you. I mean, there is still quite
a lot of real complexity there, but I think that some well-placed Tentacles – the debut of Tentacles,
Benjamin – might just be enough
to narrow him down. I think you may be right. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do a combo bonus. Because I have to...
discard something before I pull the card for that. So I think I'm gonna
use some Curses. Because there's a combo here that I think could be
rather annoying. I wish I could wait
a little bit longer... but I can't because
I need to draw this card. You're not allowed
to combo all Curses. But the first one
does not prevent them from asking a question
or taking transit. So we're going to start with
Curse of the Right Turn. And then I'm going to play Curse of the
Impressionable Consumer. That probably means that they
need to go out on the streets. So I think they would just hopefully just waste a lot of time
trying to find this. The thing is, I do need to... In order to play this – because I need to discard
a Curse and one other card – and the Seekers'
next question is free. But I think it's worth a shot. I don't think the 15 minute
time bonus is worth much, and the Curse of the Frozen Dot... Honestly, it's tricky. But yeah, I think
I'm gonna play this. So now I get to draw three. (jet engines passing) Airplanes. So one... two, three. Discard one, draw two,
10 minute bonus, five minute bonus. Oh, those are not great. I guess I'll keep the
discard one, draw two. Alright. Hello, we've been Cursed.
We've been Cursed. We've been Cursed. We've been Cursed in a way that I would argue –
– is very confusing. It's not the
best way to Curse us. Curse of the Right Turn. For the next hour,
the Seekers can only turn right at any street intersection. Curse of the
Impressionable Consumer. The Seekers must buy a product
that they saw an advertisement for before asking another question. This advertisement must
be found out in the world, not on a Seeker's device. Casting cost: The Seekers'
next question is free. But the first one
only lasts for an hour, and it prevents us from taking
right turns when walking. Yeah. And it's like,
we ain't walking. And then— The other one,
not a very good— We're headed towards –
– literally Tokyo. We're gonna be able to
clear that in five minutes. I'd say...
Sam, Sam. This is what many
would call a blunder. It is crazy that we
asked about the airports, and he's within 20 miles
of Narita Airport. It is crazy. I mean, literally our first question
referenced Narita Airport. Okay, they got this
great observation deck here. So that is a...
that's a 787 from Zipair, which is a low-cost airline that's a subsidiary of,
I think, Japan Airlines. Alright, and here's a
Vietnam Airlines A350. Way over there is an
Asiana A330, I think. I do love how all the
airport workers here wear hard hats. They never do that anywhere else. Oh, look at all that cargo. Wait, Ben, I just
realized something. Yeah? Curse of the
Impressional Consumer means that
our next question is free. Which means that we can
do a free Tentacles. Oooh, that hoits. That's gotta hoit. Oh, that hoits.
Ooh, that's gotta hoit ya. Those are the most
expensive questions. Oh, we get to ask the most expensive
question for free. For free. ♪ Free ♪ Look, the cards
require a certain... you know, panache.
A certain skill with card games. You, the audience, you— I bet you would do
better with the cards. You would definitely
do better with the cards. And in fact, you can do
better with the cards. Because of course
you could buy this game. We adapted this game,
as we have mentioned, to be played wherever you live.
Mhm. Then you would do
better with the cards. And you would have
so much fun. But there's gonna be
a thing you can click on. You can click on it.
And you should click on it. I don't know.
Could be interesting. Could be very interesting. Alright. Oof. Time for massage number two. Let's check on Ben and Adam. Okay, looks like they're
getting close to Tokyo Station. So they've made the correct decision
just to come to Tokyo. Once they're at Tokyo Station,
it's about an hour out to here. But they first have to figure out,
here's the spot, of course. Sorry, it's the massage... stuff gets distracting
in a delightful way. It's just, oh, it's finding a
really good spot in my back. Hooh. Alright. Alright.
Welcome to Tokyo, Ben! Welcome back to Tokyo. Well, we got some
Curses to deal with. We gotta find an advertisement, then we gotta buy
what it's telling us. How will we possibly do that
in Tokyo Station? It may be impossible. There's an advertisement
for whatever that is. They seem to
be advertising rice. I don't think we can buy innovating energy
technology, probably. Well... So, the right turns thing
doesn't apply to us in the station, because it's only for streets.
No, it's streets. Kind of does
nothing to us right now. It seems to be for
some kind of software. That doesn't work. I mean, we might want
to pop out of the station. Yeah. Oh-oh-oh! That's an ad for a drink. Let's go up there. But remember,
we can only turn right. Well, but this
is still a walkway. Yeah, yeah.
Did you get what it was? It was...
It was some kind of water. It'll come back. Come back. Come back, please. Ooh! Okay, I didn't have
my shoes off last time. And the underfoot
action is... ticklish. But delightful. Oh.
Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola. Alright, let's buy a Coca-Cola. We were sitting at
this digital billboard for 10 minutes waiting
for something to come up. I bet you that
there's Coca-Cola inside of New Days.
Yeah. ♪ New Days ♪ Wonderful. Coca-Cola secured. Alright, we have been
impressionable consumers. So the Curse is now clear. They have cleared their Curses. Which, to be honest,
that didn't impede them that much, unfortunately. Now that that Curse
is out of the way, we are going to head to Narita, and we're going to hit him
with some Tentacles. Tentacle time!
And it's going to be free, Ben! And it's going
to be freaking free. (sighs)
Alright. (exhales deeply) Unfortunately, it's actually
going to take a while to get there, because we're now on slow lines.
Yeah, well... The good thing is
I think we've got him... mostly figured out at this point.
Yeah. It's a 747. Oh, look at that big boy. Oh, it's an itsy-bitsy
Japan Airlines plane. I love that. The (bleep) is an Aero K? I've never heard of that.
And I know my airplanes. I don't think that's a real airline. Aa— I'm gonna say it now.
I don't care. I don't care when
Ben and Adam get me. I'm sitting out here,
nice little breeze. I'm sipping sake on some ice, ripping through
single-use plastics... and watching some planes take off.
This is amazing. I love this. Okay, what I don't love... They are on basically
the direct route to here from Tokyo Central. It is the most intuitive way
to get in this general direction. But, I don't love it. They might be coming here.
This is bad. They might be coming here. Uh-hum... Where does that line go? Oh wait, airplane. Alright, so, hello. We are here reporting from... We are at almost the middle
of the remaining area where Sam could be hiding. And we are about
to deploy our Tentacles. Yes, we're about to
activate our Tentacles tool. So Tentacles is a new tool
that is useful for narrowing down sort of denser, more metro-y areas. Okay, here's
how Tentacles work. The Seekers ask the Hider
the following question: That blank can be filled
with one of four things: zoos, aquariums,
amusement parks, and metro lines. So, if there are five zoos
within 15 miles of the Seekers, the Hider must say which of
the five they are nearest to, cutting down the potential
hiding area by 80%. The only caveat is that
the Hider must also be within 15 miles of the Seekers, or the question returns
a null answer. The tool is called Tentacles
because you can envision the Seekers turning all the zoos
within 15 miles of them into their tentacles,
which feel around for the Hider until the nearest one
pings back with a hit. The key to Tentacles is
that it's incredibly useful for helping Seekers
narrow down the Hider's location in dense urban areas. In rural areas,
Tentacles are useless because there will likely be
no amusement parks, no zoos, no aquariums, and no metro lines. But in denser urban areas,
there will be several of each. And the more there are,
the better for the Seekers, as it means they end up with
more precise information. And so we are
going to ask about which amusement park
Sam is closest to. There are five within
15 miles of us. We are going to ask right... ...now. This sucks.
They're getting close enough that I think I gotta start
heading to my hiding spot. Just in case, you know? I was really enjoying
my plane spotting. Guess who just got Tentacled? Oh, that doesn't sound right. Oh yeah, I'm definitely
within 15 miles. Oops. Well, they're gonna like that. I don't like that
they're gonna like that. (gasps) It was a hit. Okay, he's closest—
Alright, wait, wait, wait. He's closest to
Fantasy Kids Resort, which is actually very interesting. Because it's close to
another one. It's close to this one,
and it's kind of close to this one. So that gives us
quite the limited... Oh, that's quite good. That's quite good.
...area. Alright, this is us. Alright. Wow, it's hot here. I forgot how hot it is outside. The answer is very. They are in Narita, the city, now. Oh, that's uncomfortably close. Okay, I sure hope
they're getting out of the train in Narita right now...
and going like... ""Where the (bleep)
could he be now?"" The area where he could be
is pretty limited right now. But it's gonna take a minute to figure out exactly
what that area is. We got a little bit of work to do. Maybe not. I don't know. One can dream. Okay, they've been in Narita
long enough at least to make me believe that
they did not stay on the train, which would have
brought them right here, which is great news. So now they gotta figure out where within 15 miles of
wherever the (bleep) I am. Let me see if I can
follow some logic here. What angle is that?
85 degrees. So you, the audience, this was easy for our
motion graphic designers. But it actually took us
quite a while to figure out what area that meant he was in. But you can see it
now on the screen. It means he's somewhere in here,
in this slice. And so I believe that means that he is on
one of these two lines. How confident
do we feel about that? Well, could he
not be further east? This is the slice. So I actually don't really
think he could be east unless he's at the airport. Which maybe he is.
It'd be pretty weird. It would be an
interesting thing for him to do. Honestly... I think they're gonna
guess that I'm here. Because they know now
I'm within 15 miles of that radius, and once you think about it, you realize that the airport's
a great hiding spot. Maybe. Here's what I reckon. I think probably another
question is in order. Yes.
One thing we could do is we could hit him
with a quick Radar. Just to figure out
within that 15 miles, close, or is he far out?
Yeah. I'd be inclined to
try a little Radar. A 10 mile or a 5 mile? 5 mile, if it's a miss, would tell us he didn't
go to the airport. I don't think he would
have gone to the airport. No, that would have been
too weird even for him. Back in Terminal 2. Alright, I'm gonna hang out
here for a while, 'cause... I'm close enough
that I should be able to get back to the hiding spot if they start coming towards here. What do you reckon, Ben? What's annoying is,
I would love a seven. We could do our choose.
Do you want to choose a seven? I'll do a seven if you want. Yeah, yeah,
seven just feels right. Oh, we got a 7 mile Radar. That's interesting. That's very specific. I'm tempted to use a randomize,
because I have two of them. 'Cause seven miles pretty cleanly kind of
tells them here-ish. Mmm, I guess
I'm gonna randomize it. Problem is, the thing that they
randomize with could be worse. But I have another randomize.
I think I'm gonna try it. Okay, Sam's hit us
with a randomize. So, there are six remaining Radars. It's just gonna be
what comes up on the screen. Yeah, okay.
We're hoping for five or six. Okay. Six.
Six? Okay, so that's
a 10 mile Radar. That's fine.
That's still fine. It's a little bigger
than we would have liked, but it's way better
than if it had been... Yeah, yeah, that's
still somewhat useful. Alright, well... the randomize apparently
got 10 mile Radar. Which, almost the same thing. I'm not sure that was
worth the powerup. That's sometimes
how the jets lag. Okay, finally get to
draw new cards again. One. Two. That is not great. Okay, a bit of
confusing card stuff here. I selected to draw one, and then I used it
to draw a new card, the Curse of the Lemon Phylactery. But I couldn't fulfill its
casting cost of a Curse, so I discard one, draw two to discard that,
and drew two more. And draw two.
Ooh, ten minute bonus. Not bad. Ten minute bonus. Okay, well, could've
wished for more. That's alright.
Well, better than nothing. It is so hot here. Sort of some of the hottest we've ever seen
in terms of heat. I'm like in a wetsuit. Well, this is a choice
that you made. Yeah. Okay, Ben, it's a hit. I mean, we figured
it probably would be. So, Ben, he's
either at the airport, up a few stops this way,
or on one of these lines. I don't hate the idea
of getting on this line, on the local,
and asking if he— if our train would
stop at his station. Well, do we want
to get a photo of... something we could maybe
recognize before we do that? Yes. Because if we're
riding that line— Let's ask for a photo. Of what, of... tallest building
from the train station? Yeah. Or we could do
the train platform. No, tallest building
from the train station. He sends us a picture
of Narita Airport as the tallest building.
He can see that will be very funny. Well, they have asked
the question. Tallest building from station. Well, that's what this is for. It's gonna be another randomize. I'm just like, I don't feel
like I have another option. I gotta try it. The man has done
another randomize. That's annoying. He's hit us with
yet another randomize. So I guess we're gonna
get a random photo. The thing is, we can just
ask that photo again. It just means he gets a card. Okay, random number
1 to 14. Here we go. 13. Ooh, Strava map of
a half mile walk. Okay, great. That's pretty good. I don't mind that at all. No, that's gonna be
still quite useful. Okay, they got a Strava map. That'll be a bit useful. Okay, my technique is that
there's some very unhelpful, perfectly 90 degree turns here. So I reckon I just do the
most generic thing possible and do a bit of a square, you know? I think that would work. So this is the local line. It's one of the two that
we think he could be on. I mean, you want to just
go sit on the train for now? Let's go get on the train. I'm gonna jaywalk. Here is turn five. This isn't great. I mean, this is going
to be pretty notable. But... it's the best I could do. Alright, time for a new card. Curse of the Mediocre Travel Agent. Curse of the
Mediocre Travel Agent. Choose any publicly accessible place within a half mile of the
Seekers' current location. They must go there,
spend at least 10 minutes there, and acquire a souvenir
before asking another question. Casting cost:
Their vacation destination must be further from you
than their current location. Oh, this is good. Okay, we have the map. I don't know. It's gonna be hard to match that
with these towns. Okay, so right now we're
taking off on the local line. And we're gonna ask him if our train would
stop at his station. Because we're pretty sure
we've narrowed it down to two lines. Yeah. Okay, they hit me
with a train service. And the answer's no. And that means I get
to draw three more! One. Five minute bonus. Two. Fifteen minute bonus. Three. Discard one, draw two. Let me keep discard one, draw two.
I think I'll play that right now. So I'm gonna discard
one ten minute bonus with a discard one, draw two and draw two more,
which are gonna be... Duplicate another card.
Ooh, that could be good. And 20 minute bonus.
Oh, wow, that was so worth it. Let's go. Well, this is interesting. They seem to be heading
away from the airport. This is despite the fact
that I think quite soon they're going to learn that the airport would be the
right direction to go. Okay, not the same train line. Okay, Sam is not
on this train line, which means that,
I guess we should— He's almost certainly
on the other train line then. So we need to get off
at the next stop and we need to get to
the other train station. The only other thing is he could technically
be at the airport. Maybe he's at the damn airport? Maybe that's why he tried to
not answer the tallest building. Well, we should ask
tallest building again. I am now like,
what if he's at the stupid airport? I mean, the thing is
if he's at the airport, it would at least be
obvious with this question. Yeah.
That is where he's at. Look, I still think
we're gonna be fine, but we are getting... closer to a dangerous time
than I would like. He certainly has been
milking the end of this game. Okay, so—
Oh, it's so hot. Okay, so Sam was
not on the local line. So we're going back. Hurry, Ben. If we can make this. Okay, great.
Back to Narita. We're gonna go
ahead and ask Sam for a photo of the tallest
building from the station, again. It's frankly suspicious that
he didn't want to answer that. Yeah. And we do think there's
a chance he's at the airport. It would be funny. It wouldn't be that funny. Alright, welp,
they hit me with the tallest building
from the train station. That sucks. Well, I think it was inevitable. Can we go back to the Keisei? Yes, we have to go
back to the Keisei line. And we have to ride
it to the airport so that we can get on it
going the other way. Alright. I've walked this
hallway so many times. Unfortunately for me, this is definitely an
entrance to the train station. And that control tower is
definitely the tallest. (sighs)
So there's no way around this. Alright. I'm sending them the photo. I think they're going to love this. Ben, he's at the airport. What? Adam says
""mother-(bleep)-er."" That's kind of rude. Back here. Time to sit down. Given the Curses I have on hand,
I think I might be here for a while. I think we might have him. Adam, are you sure that
none of these other stations have an air traffic control tower? There have been people
coming through this station, taking photos and stuff.
Clearly, like train enthusiasts. So, just by the way,
for you train enthusiasts out there, the reason this station,
Higashi-Narita, is so famous is because it basically has
no reason to still exist. It was built in 1978
to serve the airport, but then in the '90s, they built stations
in Terminals 1 and 2 that made it obsolete. It's also home to Japan's shortest
independent railway operator, Shibayama Railway Company,
a company that runs a single line between this never-used station
and an even less-used station past the airport called
Shibayama-Chiyoda, all of which is why this station tends to be filled with
only two kinds of people: train enthusiasts and lost tourists who accidentally transferred
onto the wrong line. Okay.
What line is it? Wait. Is it this? Yeah, we could've taken that. Wait, no, this is wrong.
This is the rapid line. We need to know,
but ours is different. The local. Yeah, down there. Down there?
It's the local. It's on track two. Alright. It is actually worth
considering though, Adam, that the airport, I think,
has two stops. I know, that's why
we're getting on the local. I cannot believe he went
to the (bleep)-ing airport. So, we know
he's at the airport. But where in the airport? Well, here's the thing. I have to imagine
that the whole reason that he hid at the airport is that he has some (bleep)-ed up
little final hiding spot that he thinks is going
to be impossible to find. But how (bleep)-ed up
could it be? I think it could be
pretty (bleep)-ed up. This tunnel is so spooky. This tunnel is so spooky
that it includes... lizards, I think? Well, they are coming in hot. I mean, here's the thing...
is that airport is huge. It's huge. Yeah, it's a big airport. But he's gonna be in
some weird ass terminal. He's gonna be in
the private plane area terminal bull-(bleep)
or whatever. It's the first place
we ever caught Sam. You know what I mean?
Was in a private plane hangar. Roll the clip. Do we stop here? No, no, no.
This is before... Higashi. Well, he could be here. Narita. Could he? Could it not be?
I don't know. A train just came through, and it just kind of pushed
the air just ever so slightly, even all the way up here, to make it less stagnant
and slightly cooler. And that was delightful. So nice. Wait, is this taking us
to the right thing? (bleep) Ben, I think this
might be taking us to this (bleep)-ing thing. Yeah. Hello? Turn around.
We went the wrong way. We went too far, it's fine. There's a weird little station. Yeah, at the airport. Ah, god damn it. Not ideal. I mean, presumably
this will just turn right back around.
Yeah. Okay, well,
this is interesting and also potentially quite bad. They... They took this line. This is the only stop past here. I don't know why they
would have taken this line. Rather than one of the
Narita Airport lines. That's really weird. But that means that
they're going to come back via this station. (bleep) Why would they have
taken that train? I wonder if they just messed up. I told you it's not that far. Well, but that was very...
I'm just saying. Alright, back we go. Alright, well, the decision
we need to make now, because their train is
three minutes away, is... Do I hit him with the Travel Agent
using this card, or do I duplicate this card? Yeah, I guess I gotta duplicate this
'cause the 20 minute time, this is not gonna get me
into first place. Yeah, okay, so let me duplicate it. I think I'm just gonna
send them plane spotting. To the observation deck. That's how you get
to Terminal 2. Hopefully they notice that... and take that turn
and don't notice me here. I'm lucky I sat on this
side of the pillar. 'Cause honestly I didn't
think about it too much. And I could've sat on that side
and I'd be completely visible. I'm not allowed to move now,
so, you know... I think I hear the train. Let's go get him. So we have no way of knowing
which terminal he's in. (whispering) Okay. The train just stopped
at the platform. I heard it. Okay, I'm gonna be
really quiet, really still. What has he done? We have to Travel Agent
to Terminal 1. Okay. Should we
get back on this or no? No.
No. Terminal 1? Wait here. Wait here. Okay, the train's leaving. This could be it.
This could be it. Walk 10 minutes.
Okay. Okay. To here, here. Go straight, upstairs.
Thank you. (whispering)
That's them. I hear them.
Then left. Okay. Thank you.
Thank you. Okay. Well, the question is,
do we want to try and clear it? (whispering) Oh god,
I think they're coming here. Do you think it's
worth our time to clear it? He still has to
send us the photo, right? Yeah.
Yeah. I think it's— Oh, hey Sam! Oh. Hi. How's it going? (wheezes) I was very stressed out.
(cackles gleefully) Why did you take
that train line? By accident!
I thought you would. You know, this is, only 1,400 people a day
use this train line. And the whole thing about it
Was that your whole cool plan? Is that nobody uses it.
Nobody uses it? Yeah.
As your whole cool thing. I mean, in fairness to you,
this is a crazy station. Nobody's here. You would— It took me an hour just to find the entrance
to this station. Truly very abandoned. Yeah, there's
not a lot going on. Wow, that sucks for you, man. Hey, look, it was the
same deal for you yesterday. Yeah, wow. What also sucks
is your best exit would have been that one. Mmm.
(chuckles deeply) We were just wandering there. Yeah. Bye, Ben. Alright, Ben, bye! Good luck.
Good luck. You know,
now that I think about it, I have somewhat gifted
the person with the winning run, the geography that led
to the winningest run. Yeah, you know,
I was thinking about that. It's not the best, I would say. Yeah. Should we find a nice
corner to sleep in? Yeah, 'cause we—
'cause that's how it works. We sleep in the place
where we end, obviously. Wait, are you joking?
What have you been doing? (water rushing) Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Thank you for watching this week's episode
of Jet Lag: The Game. As always, you can
watch the next episode right this very instant by
going and signing up for Nebula. We put every episode of
Jet Lag up one week early, so you can go watch
episode four right now by signing up for Nebula.
Instant gratification. Instant gratification.
Instant gratification. Instant gratification.
Alright, here's the thing. We're doing themed ad read.
Okay. We're doing travel
and transit themed. If you like travel,
if you like transit, if you like that sort of thing,
which you probably do because you watch this show...
Perfect. Why should those people
sign up for Nebula? Okay, well, I mean,
for starters, basics, you get every episode of
Jet Lag one week early. You also get access to our
exclusive aftershow podcast, The Layover, that's only on Nebula. I will also say,
we made a whole series that is only on Nebula
called The Getaway. It's a reality competition show that's like The Mole,
except we made everybody the mole as a prank.
But importantly... it's on a road trip
through the American West, and it's very pretty,
and that's travel. Seamless segue.
Seamless segue out of that. One of the cast members
out of that? Steven Bridges! Yes!
We love him. We love Steven Bridges. And Steven Bridges,
he's a professional card counter. Legitly, not as a... Not non-legitly.
Legitly. And he makes this YouTube channel where he wears a
hidden camera, kind of, and just documents
his job going around. And it has real Jet Lag vibes
because he puts together these frantic trips
where he's going to all... Yeah, and it's serialized.
You do the different episodes. ...to all these casinos
and going to the casinos and betting huge amounts of money. And it really kinda
feels like Jet Lag except the stakes are real. Yeah, and I legit, no joke,
have started watching his videos and I'm really in there.
They are legit very good. Alright.
And they're on Nebula! Seamlessly segue us out
of this to another reason. You know what? I also... You know what also can be counted
as an addition to cards? The number of transit creators
on Jet— on Nebula. Such as Not Just Bikes, who makes video essays
about transit. And sort of, you know,
I've actually learned, legit I have learned a lot about
urban design and transit design from watching that channel. I feel like now when I go to a city, and I'm like,
""This city's vibes suck,"" I know why and that's
because of Not Just Bikes. Speaking of Canadians... Michael Downie. Oh, I do like Michael Downie. He goes and rides
on cool trains and Planes sometimes.
Also— Not very often planes. Some— He has before. I saw a video when
he was on a plane. Yeah, he does both.
But mostly trains. Sometimes he just
goes to Formula 1 races, which is not very trains oriented,
but he just has a good time. Well, they're in cars,
they're riding around. Yeah, I guess, sort of.
Anyway, it's great. Ben, you name one. No, maybe not. Alright, Sam, before we go,
name one more travel creator. I'm gonna name you another
Canadian travel creator. Whoa!
There's a lot of them. In fact, I could even
pick between two of them. RMTransit does great
transit more oriented stuff. Sure.
I'm 95% sure he's Canadian. And Rare Earth.
Yeah. One of the best.
He goes crazy places, in his stuff. He does not have fear seemingly. That's all on Nebula. The tl;dr is
that's just what we— That's just travel.
Come out of... And that's just
the travel we thought of. There are more travel
creators on Nebula. Ben, you haven't
said many things. How do they sign up for this? Well, if you go into
your internet browser and you go ahead and
you type in nebula.tv/jetlag, that's gonna go ahead
and get you 40% off, which is a treat from us. And that's also how we
make sure that we get paid so that we can keep
making this show. And then that is, you know... If you like the show
and you want to keep going, that's how you should do it. And I just want to emphasize,
please use /jetlag. So many of my friends
and family will be like, ""Hey, I signed up for Nebula
to watch your show."" And I'm like, ""Did you
use the 'jetlag' code?"" And they go, ""No."" And so I'm like, so not only
are you not getting 40% off, but also now we don't get—
We're not seeing any— We gotta get a little
chunk of that change. We only get it if you use
/jetlag. And now everyone is destitute. nebula.tv/jetlag. Bye."

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","eRWobpethq4","Alright, well... I believe that this spot
has a few things that should throw them off. Here's hoping. Welcome to episode two of our six-day game of
hide-and-seek across Japan. Quick reminder, in this game, the Hider has three and a half hours
to travel anywhere in Japan, and then the Seekers
have to find them as quickly as possible
by asking them questions from the giant question menu. Last episode, Ben was found in
the small town of Yamadera after hiding for
9 hours and 19 minutes, plus 40 minutes of Time Bonus cards. Last night, Adam traveled from
Yamadera to his hiding spot, and now Ben and I
need to go find him. Ben! Ben! Wake up! Ben!
Ohh... ohh... Oh, it's time to go get Adam.
Let's go, let's go! Alright, alright,
let's go get him. Let's go get him.
(both grunt) Alright, Ben. Seemingly the first decision
we need to make... is basically... which direction we go
out of this town. Yep, there's one train
in each direction. We gotta figure out
which one we're getting on. My instinct... is that he went to Sendai. Because that would get him
onto a much faster high-speed line. So he could get much
geographically further. Yeah.
And I think, you know, everyone's first instinct is
more about physical distance. Right, like if he went
towards Yamagata last night... where could he have really gone? He could have gone a little bit up. He could have gone a little bit
down towards Yonezawa. I reckon a Radar is
actually pretty useful, 'cause more or less,
I think it'll tell us whether or not he took a fast Shinkansen. Take a look at a
50-mile Radar. Yeah, let's see
what that gets us. It would include Fukushima.
It would include Sendai. It would basically
split the map in two. The things that he would go to if he did not take a fast
Shinkansen out of Sendai, and the things that
he would have gotten to if he had taken a fast
Shinkansen out of Sendai. What do you think?
Should we hit him with it? (exhales stiffly) I think hit him with it.
Alright, sending. Okay, so if the Radar...
is a hit, we go to Yamagata. If it's a miss, we go to Sendai.
I think so, yeah. Alright. Okay. So, somewhat predictably, they have started
with a 50-mile Radar. That is certainly a miss. I will tell them that. I mean, the thing about that is that it does
eliminate quite a lot. And especially, I think, it eliminates almost all of
the possibilities in the north. So it kind of gives them
a direction, I suppose. They can presumably just
go to the Shinkansen now. But that means that I get
to draw my first cards. 10 minute bonus. Veto. I think it's gotta be veto, right?
Yeah, okay. Keep a veto. Alright. What's next? Do you want to check
out this cool castle? So, what I do know,
Ben, is that... Adam spent, legit, three hours searching
for his spot. Yeah, that sounds like Adam. What you looking at?
(giggles) Find anything interesting? Sorry. And he was not happy
with his options. Oh, good. But what I do think,
based on the three hours, is... he's not— he's gonna try
to do something tricky. He's gonna try to do
something unintuitive. We've gotta calibrate
for trickiness, I think. No, I know.
He likes winning. He does like winning. And I think he's
intimidated, honestly, by your 9 hours and 59 minutes. Yeah. The thing about trains
in these countries, Ohh!
you can get far. What? It's a miss.
Alright. That's great.
I think that's great. I think that's good. And that means that almost certainly
he couldn't have gone to Yamagata. Yeah. Here comes
the train to Yamagata. Which we are not taking, right? I think that we are
going to skip that one. Okay, so... What do we do? So this is (bleep) Castle. Or I guess it's
the ruins of (bleep) Castle. This is a really old house
with a traditional thatched roof, which is kind of cool. There's a little sign here that explains it's
a Tateana structure. It's called a Kabetachishiki
Tateana Jukyo. I definitely said that wrong.
Pretty neat, though. I do have to be honest with you that there are just such an
insane number of bugs here. So I am going to go to a
slightly more open area and see if that helps. Hello, butterfly. Okay, we're just looking at
other questions we can ask to try and figure out... what direction to go once
we get to Sendai, 'cause... Yeah, so... I feel good
about going to Sendai, but I don't know what we're
going to do after that. Yeah, I mean, the one thing
that is uniquely useful right now, and Adam and I were
actually looking at this, and we wanted to use this
until you Cursed us yesterday... (snickers)
was the last name of the prefecture. Because basically,
half of the prefectures in our likely area end with A.
And we're currently in Yamagata. So we would exclude or include
Fukushima, Akita, Niigata, and, you know, some others. Whereas these ones, you know, it sort of splits the area
in two, basically. I mean, the best thing
you can do with these questions is just to split the
remaining area in half. Okay, well, we need to ask now
before we leave Yamagata. Should we do it?
I think let's do it. I think let's do it.
Okay. Yep, train to Sendai is here. I think that'll be useful. Yeah, it might not be the thing
that gives us direction right now, but it'll very much be useful
at some point. Yeah, I like it.
Okay, let's go to Sendai. Okay, they've asked for
the last letter of my prefecture. They're in the Yamagata prefecture,
which ends with A. I'm not gonna tell you
what prefecture I'm in, but it does not end with A.
I'll tell you that. But I do get to draw...
three more cards. Five minute bonus, not great. Veto question, again, okay. And then a bonus. Well, awesome. Not great cards so far, guys. Not great cards. This is not what we need. I wonder what they're up to. Okay, so they have headed east towards Sendai on that line. Which is the sort of better
direction for them to go. I would have preferred
if they had gone west. So that is annoying but ultimately probably not
a huge difference maker. Alright, we got our answer. Not a match. Okay. That's a lot of... That's pretty good. Especially considering that... we're almost certain he—
this is all gone. Just 'cause he couldn't
have gotten that far. So, he basically... is probably up here. Yeah. He— I don't even know if
he could have gotten down here. We can look into it.
Or he could be in Tokyo. Which would be so annoying.
Which would be so annoying. We should investigate
this area here. Yeah, so what's in there? Because I actually think
that there's a chance that he could not have
gotten here. Because I think that
he could have only taken the fastest Shinkansen from Sendai,
which might not stop there. Interesting, interesting. Oh no, wait.
Oh, this is tricky. So he could have gotten
to Ōmiya. But Ōmiya is in Saitama. But he could have gone
to Ōmiya and gone north. Why would he have
done that, though? I don't think
he would have. But... Okay, I won't cross this out,
but I think that the chance that he could have gotten here...
We can consider this unlikely. Very unlikely. I know that this is cursing us,
but I'm just adding a little 'probably not' this area. So... We don't think he's here. We think it's unlikely
that he's in Tokyo, because he could
have really just gone to Tokyo Station. The sort of behavioral
analysis on Adam says no. Yeah. He could not have gone
to Hokkaido based on time. So we think he is in one
of these two prefectures. Yeah. Since this is
the Shinkansen line, we could go from Sendai
all the way to Morioka. In just 40 minutes.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, if we went up there, then we could just ask
the prefecture question and hopefully slice the
remaining map in two. And especially, I mean, that's the biggest prefecture.
Yeah. I think that there's
a very good chance he's in that top one.
Mhm. Adam, we're coming for you.
I think, probably. Maybe.
Maybe. I think so. Okay, so obviously
while we're here... we need to be looking
for hiding spots. Now, the woods is
certainly an option. But here's the thing. You have to hide within
10 feet of a path or an area meant for walking. And the path network
in this whole area is not actually as complicated
as I might like for it to be. So I'm gonna bank
this area as a possibility, but I think we should go to the slightly more developed
area of the hiding zone and kind of check that out. Okay, so this area... I think is just too open
for the most part. They could go here and
take a big look around and, you know,
find a picture of the tallest manmade structure
if they made me send that. Let's see if there's
anything kinda further down. Okay, here's a thought. What if I hide in the woods,
but not the woods they think? What if I hide... in those trees? Right? Because once they
see that I'm in trees, they'll assume I'm in the big park. And they'll go there and
spend all their time there. They probably won't
even think to check a different set of trees. Welcome back, Sam. Thank you. Alright, should we head to the Shinkansen section
and head north? Yep, I think we're just
going to send it up north and check and see if he's
in the same prefecture. Might as well. I think we got time. And honestly, if we end up
being right about this, it's going to save us
a ton of time in the end. Oh yeah, I think it's a risk.
It's certainly a risk. But one worth taking.
Yeah. Alright, let's find a Shinkansen. Look at that.
It's a bamboo forest. Kinda fun. Probably can't hide there, though. Okay, so they've just
arrived in Sendai, which means that they should
be having to make a decision. I'm actually not sure if
they know with confidence which direction to go. But even if they do,
the bigger question is going to be how far in a direction do they go? And I don't think they have
a good sense of that. My hope with this placement
is that there's a good chance they overshoot me. I have to say, it's been a while
since they asked me a question. Which is a little surprising.
They've only asked two. You'd kind of think they'd
be asking me questions, you know, before they got there, so that they could
get right on a train. I mean, maybe they are just
getting right on a train. Alright. Adam's either going to be
very pleased or very upset that we are getting on this train. Yep. Alright, so
what I said before... Kind of interesting
the way it turned out. They did get on a Shinkansen. Wrong one, boys. Wrong one. They are headed the wrong way.
Alright, good. Okay, so this path is
kind of intriguing to me because I think that if I
go down it far enough... I can maybe access the woods
that are on its left. And that could be very interesting. Because, again,
I'd really like to hide... in a different set of woods
that they won't expect. Oh, maybe down there. Okay, now we're talking, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Those are some random woods. Okay, and this is a weird path.
Very weird. Alright, Ben.
We're here. We're about to enter into
this prefecture here. Come on. Oh, there we are.
Okay, we're in it. Let's text him. This is nice. Oh, lovely. Let's go dip our feet in the river. That sounds like it
would be so nice. Well, they have asked if I am in the same
prefecture as them. And the answer is
that I simply am not. I simply am not! This also means I
need to draw my cards. I really need these to
be better this time. Alright, one. Okay, we got a Curse. Curse of the
Mediocre Travel Agent. Choose any publicly accessible place within a half mile of the
Seekers' current location. They must go there,
spend at least 10 minutes there, and acquire a souvenir
before asking another question. Casting cost:
Their vacation destination must be further from you
than their current location. Two. 10 minute bonus. Three. Got another Curse. Curse of the Frozen Dot. Place a point on the map
at least 1,000 feet from where the Seekers are currently standing. If in exactly 15 minutes, they are within
250 feet of that point, they are frozen in place
for the next 30 minutes. Yeah, Curse of the
Mediocre Travel Agent, for sure. For sure. Well, that was better. Our answer should
be coming any second now. What do you think?
Oh, god, I don't know, Sam. I think he's probably
in this prefecture. I agree. If he went much further north,
he wouldn't have enough time to transfer onto
another smaller line. Oh, honestly, his ability to do
that in here, even, is pretty limited. It's a no. Alright, okay. That's big.
(sighs) Okay, quickly, let's decide. Do we want to do a Thermometer?
I think we got to... Okay, so now at this point... He could either be...
up in this tiny area... or he could be down in Tokyo or he could maybe
technically be in here, but he would have had to
do something really weird. Or we've messed up
catastrophically. Or we've messed up
catastrophically. Don't forget that option. I think we need
to do a Thermometer because I think we need
to know if he's up here. Do we want to do
a 5, a 15? I mean we could do
a 15 really easily. Yeah, I think we just hit a 15. Okay, should I start it?
Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause, boy, if he's... If it's wrong, if it's colder,
we have (bleep)-ed up a lot. Alright, we're at the
end of our Thermometer. That was quick.
Alright, send it. Now I'm getting nervous. Now this is giving me flashbacks
to our time in Switzerland. Shh-shh-shh-shh.
We're not there yet, Sam. We're not there yet.
No, we're not. But if this Thermometer
is not hotter, we got an issue. Alright, they have done
a Thermometer. 15 miles. Seemingly, they're just
trying to figure out if I'm north or south of them. Again, I could veto, but I feel like they could
just get the information from a Radar if I did that, so... I don't actually think
that that would be worth it. (sighs) Okay. I will tell them. Colder, colder. We're cooked! Okay, no, we're not cooked.
Okay, well, we need to get off. Okay, yeah,
we do need to get off. Also, we're cooked. This is it.
Shh, shh, shh. It's so over, Ben.
Shut up, shut up. It's so over.
Okay, let's get off the train. How is he south? Oh, god damn it. I don't get it. Well... Look, there's a couple of,
there's still a couple of options. There are a couple
of options, but... for the most part,
it's Tokyo Station. Or there's that little bit... right above Sendai. (bleep) Could he really just be
sitting outside of Tokyo Station? Alright, two more cards. Discard two, draw three. I don't hate that. Or a five minute bonus.
Yeah, okay. I'll take discard two, draw three. Alright, well... We have our hiding spot. I say we go back to
our castle area. Just 'cause it's a nice place
to hang out, more than anything. I have to say that this is
pretty good for me. You know, we're, what... three hours into the game day, and I think they're
further from me now than when they started. It's not bad. What do we even do now?
We're going back. We're going back, Sam. The thing is, Ben... Adam and I were
talking a lot yesterday about how tricky it is that... on the line between
Sendai and Tokyo... there's all sorts of
different Shinkansens with different
configurations of stops. Some are super express
and go straight to Tokyo. Some make a couple of stops.
Some make all of the stops. It's very possible
that there was a Shinkansen... that made a weird
stop configuration. Which means that part of that prefecture
is fair game. Or something like that.
I don't know. Alright, we've been
deep in research mode and are not pleased
about the options. I mean, there
just aren't that many. 'Cause we think
we've excluded... We've really drilled
into this area here. But we really don't see options
when you look at schedules and our Radar and kinda
all the things combined. Every single thing
can be excluded based on one factor
that we can find. Yeah, but I mean, look, it's...
You never know. As far as we can tell,
there are pretty few options. And it's Tokyo...
or some of the stops in there. Yeah. But the reason we don't like it is 'cause it's pretty much
just the Shinkansen stops. And we don't really think Adam would just go to
a Shinkansen stop. No, it seems unlikely.
It just doesn't feel right. Which, you know,
maybe he's playing us. And maybe he knows that we don't think that
he would do that. I think we need a vibe. Yeah, photo question.
We need a vibe check. Yeah. Photos are cheap. I think tallest building
visible from train station will tell us a lot, because... If he's in Ueno or Tokyo, it's gonna be a giant skyscraper.
Mhm. I would be game for
tallest building. Let's try that.
Okay. Should we send it?
Yeah. I'd just gotten so comfy. Alright. (grunts) We actually
have to hurry a little bit if we're gonna get this in
within the 15 minutes. Alright. Almost there. Alright. So this is
based on our judgment. What do we think
the tallest building is? I don't think it's the houses.
I can really only see the houses. Those silos. I think it's that warehouse. Nothing looks taller
to me than that. By my judgment, that is
the tallest building. I'm gonna take a picture of it... and send it to them. While we're here,
let's draw our card. Ooh! Alright. It's not too bad. Little 15 minute bonus
never hurt anyone. Alright, we got a photo. This is giving... small. Yeah, I mean,
it's certainly not a skyscraper, I'll tell you that much. Yeah, so, basically I think we know
that he's not in a big city. And also, those trees look forest.
I mean, they're dense. He's not in Tokyo.
He's not in Ueno. I mean, honestly... it feels like the most
likely scenario now is that we've messed up
somehow. With the assumption in that photo
that it's a pretty small place. Which it kinda has to be, if that's the tallest building
from the station. The tallest building
from the station is a single story building. I just don't see... The problem is... The way he would get down here
is he would take a Shinkansen and then he would have
very little time at all to get out of the area. Especially somewhere like that. Just don't get it.
It's a real head scratcher. I thought we were
so on the right track. Me too. I think at this point, I would just hit
a 100 mile Radar to check that little sliver. And also, if somehow we misdrew our map
or something. Or we're illiterate. Yeah, I mean,
it would at least tell us that we definitely want
to head down to there-ish. Right. I guess.
It's only two cards. Sent. I think we're cooked. No, we're not cooked. He's cooked. It's getting really hot. Okay, so they've asked for
a 100 mile Radar now. You know? Maybe I should veto it. I guess, what,
they could just do... a hotter, colder. I guess they're on a
Shinkansen headed south. So they could just go
a while and ask it. Okay. Let's draw two cards. Yeah. Eh. I guess let's take
the 10 minutes. And I have six cards, so... Let's actually use our other
discard two, draw three. Play it out. I'm going to discard
my 10 minute bonus and a veto. Let's draw three new cards just out of curiosity. Randomize question. Curse of the Hidden Hangman. Curse of the Hidden Hangman. Before asking another question or boarding another
form of transportation, Seekers must beat the Hider
in a game of hangman. Casting cost: Discard two cards. Duplicate another card.
Oh, those are some good ones. Once they get off their train... it might be time
for some Curses. Ben! (clattering)
Oh no. What's the status, Sam? I think this is good news?
It's a miss. I mean, it at least gives us
some good direction. Yeah, we just
stay on this train. So we just need to
drill into the options... there-ish.
Yeah. There's gotta be something.
Yeah. Maybe there was a
Shinkansen that we missed. We just gotta keep looking. Alright, let's go back
to the woods. 'Cause it's a nicer place
to hang out. (groans flatly)
Lot of walking today. I guess I'm making myself
do it, but I like... I like to be in the woods. Look at our
absolutely busted map. Look how st—
(clatters) We're not doing so hot, Sam. We're not doing so hot. We have asked
so many questions. How many questions... have we asked? Too many.
Six questions. Given that he has not
played anything yet... that does mean that
his hand should be full. True.
Which means that if... we ask another question now, he's gonna have to
immediately play or discard something. So... This would be a good time
to get something. I would love...
maybe the five buildings thing. If it is a not very dense area, he might have to send us
a pretty big shot to get five buildings in it.
That could have a lot of info. Yeah, and he
might have no choice but to sort of reveal something
that he doesn't want to reveal. Should we try it?
Yeah, I say, go for it. Let's do it.
Alright, Adam. Go find us five buildings. (panting heavily) Well, great news. I made it into the woods
just in time for them to ask for a photo of five buildings. (exhales) Okay.
It's actually not that bad. There are buildings
not too far from where I am. I think the key for me
in terms of strategy is I don't really want them to know just how rural this place is. I want to make it look
as urbanized as possible, I think. I mean, the tallest building
from the train station probably gave that away, but... You know. Okay. What is the most busy looking
thing we've got here? Okay, this isn't bad.
I guess it's only one building. That's some good density there. And I feel like,
with the right angle, that could look
relatively... developed. Okay.
(full mouth) We got a photo. We got the photo. It's very built.
I know. Look at all those buildings. That's a little more
not a small town, more just residential.
Mhm. That's a pretty big
and nice house for Japan. Yeah. Maybe it's a suburb
or something. Yeah, that's what I'm feeling. It just has a small station. Now that we thought Adam
was likely in a suburban area, we took an even closer look
at what his options were, and we found something
we had missed. While we previously thought
that he would have arrived at any Shinkansen stop in this area without enough time to
transfer onto a smaller line, we found one train that would have gotten
him into Utsunomiya with about 25 minutes
to get out of the city. That put Utsunomiya at the
top of our suspects list. So, we started looking
at satellite views of all the lines out of Utsunomiya
to see if anything seemed right. Sam, just anecdotally,
doesn't this... I'm looking at Kōnoyama Station. And it's a suburb
around a golf course. I'm not saying that
this is the station, but it's got the same sort of
density of trees, and... Density, it fits. I just don't really see the trees
that would be necessary. But I'm still looking. Real quick,
let's draw our card. We already have a full hand. So, I'm gonna have
to decide what to do. Five minute bonus?
Yeah, I'll just discard that. Just discard that.
That's fine. Oh man, it's hot. Oh, it's hot. Wait, can you pull up— Are you recording?
Yeah. Can you pull up the
tallest building photo? This guy? What? Do you think you see it? Show me what you're seeing.
Look at that. Oh, yeah.
Am I crazy, or is that that? Here's what— Here, let me— Wait, wait, wait, wait. Because he even has
the light pole. Just by the way,
we aren't allowed to use Google Street View in this game.
What happened here is way crazier. I clicked on this station
on Google Maps, and this picture, showing the
building in the background, just happened to be
the display image. Yeah, it does have
the light pole. And it has the white sign. Let me— Let's— Okay. This is crazy, if... 'Cause the light rail
would make sense, 'cause it's counterintuitive.
Is that off the light rail? This is on the light—
This is off the light rail. And it'd be counterintuitive.
It's weird. This is towards
the end of the line that he could have gotten. Here's— Here— Let me show you what made me
even look at this station. It's for a castle. Adam Chase. Castles are Adam Chase's
greatest weakness in this world. He loves a good castle.
He loves a castle. Let's go find a nice spot
to sit down. Okay, so quick update.
They're getting pretty close. I was hoping they
might undershoot me. Doesn't seem like that's
gonna be the case. Now we're hoping
that they overshoot. So yeah, so basically... I'm hoping that we are
not cutting to them getting off the train. If we're cutting to them
getting off the train... That is not
super awesome for me. That was a long train ride. Welcome to Utsunomiya. Productive, I think. Let's hope. I think we're about to get
hit with a bunch of Curses. Yes, but if this spot is not it, I am quitting. Yeah, I think that's fair. (pneumatic hissing) (door mechanism clicking) Okay, well,
they got off their train. I don't love having to
discard two, but I think I'm going to do
Curse of the Hidden Hangman with a veto question and
randomized question discarded. Just buy myself some time here. Alright, so now they cannot
move or ask another question until they beat me at hangman. So I have to think
of my hangman word. Famously, the hardest
word in hangman is 'jazz'. So for five letters,
which I have to do, you could do like 'jazzy'. But I think that
they might be like, ""Oh, Adam will pick
the hardest word."" And they'll see through that. So I think I need
to pick a hard word but one that is not that... ...strange. Curse of the Hidden Hangman.
Which one was that? Curse of the Hidden Hangman. Before asking another question or boarding another
form of transportation, Seekers must beat the Hider
in a game of hangman. To play, the Hider chooses
a five-letter word, and the game ends after
either a correct word guess or seven wrong letter guesses. The Seekers cannot
challenge the Hider for ten minutes after a loss. After three losses,
the Seekers are released. Alright, well, this is a
fairly high stakes game of hangman that we've gotta play. If we fail, then we get
stuck here for a little bit. Alright, should we start
with just, what, A? E.
E? Okay. So they have started
with E. No. (bleep) He's picked a— How about I?
I. Also, no. Hit him with an A. A. Yes. Smack dab in the middle. Maybe we should do a T. T. No. (bleep)
Hit him with an S. S. Oh, shee... H.
No. Alright.
We moved into the shade. The camera has melted. N is one of the
more common letters. N. No. Alright. We're doing good.
We're doing good. It's a no. C? I like C. I feel like that's kinda... You never expect...
to see a C. C. (bleep) Yes!
Okay. Okay. Do an L. L. Good.
One more wrong guess. Ack! No?
No. Scar... Scarf. 'Scarf' is pretty good. 'Scary'?
'Scary'. Yeah, I feel like
R is promising. Let's hit him with the R.
Hit him with the R. The R. We got it. Okay, one more. Is it 'scarf' or is it 'scary'?
It's 'scary'. The word is 'scary'. Ye-hes! (chuckles) Barely made it out of that.
Alright. Okay, we'll challenge
him again in ten. Ben, for round two. Go with the E. Let's do it. E. No. Y.
Y. Okay, that's annoying that
they guessed that that early. Oho, we got that. A.
No. Hit him with an O. Also no. Hit him with an I.
No. Alright, this is going
pretty good. It was the U all along. Yeah, okay. Should we try M?
Yeah, try M. M, no. (bleep) No. Do you like L or F?
F. Okay, yeah, there is an F. Yes, there we go. I bet it's 'funny'. But should we try
'funny' or 'fuzzy'? Try N.
No. Alright, come on.
One more. One more wrong guess.
One more wrong guess. (grumbles) Send him... 'fuzzy'.
No. Is it 'fuzzy'?
Lock it in. Oh (bleep) (giggles)
Yeah! He said (bleep) Okay, let's go get him. I mean, look, that
still bought me a while. Because it took a while to
play the games of hangman. So... ultimately... it could be worse. They're not asking any questions. So you have to imagine that they are trying to
figure out what to do. And there's still a pretty wide area
where I could be. So I don't think that... they have a direction
to go right now. This is great. This is the fanciest
light rail I've ever seen. Yeah, I don't think I've ever been
on a light rail this nice. Eeyuh-oh! It looks like somehow
they are headed towards me? How could they possibly
know that I'm this way? Oh my god! How did they figure that out?! That's insane. From what, from the photo? They can't have figured it out
from the photo. Okay, well, we don't have time to get to the where
we were going to hide. Okay, let's find a spot.
Let's find a spot in here. (bleep) This is it. This better be it. I need to get out of
this open woods area. What do we think about this?
Under this bridge? No, if they ask the
tallest thing I can see... they'll see a tree, and then they'll know I'm
in a bridge in the woods. (bleep) me. What the (bleep)? What the (bleep)? We're getting
pretty close, Ben. Technically, Adam
doesn't have to be in his hiding spot
until a half mile out. But I have to imagine
he's gonna be near it right now. I'm worried that we're
gonna get by the Curse. As soon as we get there.
Yeah. I think if we just ask him,
because I feel like we'll probably only need one, maybe
two questions to find him. Yeah. But yeah, I feel like
we ask him a question right before we get there.
What about tallest structure? The tallest structure
can be good. I just, I worry that he's
going to return nothing if he can't see anything. I mean, that would
be useful, but... Yeah, but he's probably
able to see some structure. I feel like, right?
Yeah. Okay. Hit him with
tallest structure. (bleep) me. Nope. Have to find a path
that's not on the map. Okay, maybe here? Around here? Okay. Alright, this is the spot. Here it is, Ben.
Is this the building? I think it's that. Sure looks right. That, I think, is our building. I mean, that, look,
it's the exact... That's gotta be it. It's— That's gotta be it.
I think that's it. I mean, we should look
from the station perspective, but it is the tallest
building around. And these...
(tapping glass) are the right kind of light poles. That looks like
the right light pole. (doors click open)
(tap sensor beeps) It is 100% it. Because, look, you can see the electric thing
in the right spot. Yeah, that is 100% it. Because you can see there's
a paper in the first window. That's there. Yeah.
The trees are the same shape. The sign's in the right spot.
That's it. I don't know what angle
he took it from. But we got him. I think we got him. Bet he's by the stupid castle again. Yeah, let's start
walking to the castle. Because that's, I think,
the most obvious spot. Alright. This is my hiding spot. Now, the reason I picked it... I mean, I was very frantic, but...
If you go to Google Maps... it'll tell you to enter
the park the other way, and I'm hopeful that they'll do that
instead of going up this way. Alright, that would be the
tallest manmade structure. Now that I've sent them
the tallest structure, let's pull another card. Okay! I'll take that. That's not bad. Alright, we're gonna do two things. First, we're gonna duplicate the Curse of the
Mediocre Travel Agent. Then, we're going to cast the Curse of the
Mediocre Travel Agent and make them go to the
Nishigi Dental Clinic. That should buy me some time. Alright, we got the photo, Ben.
Yeah, what's it look like? It's forest. Okay, forest. Actually, the one thing
I'm noticing... Visit the Nishigi Dental Clinic. Why do we have to do that? The Curse is making us
visit the dental clinic. Curse of the
Mediocre Travel Agent. The Seekers must go to the
Hider's chosen location, spend at least 10 minutes there,
and acquire a souvenir before asking another question. The location must be
further from the Seekers than the Hider. But hold on, Sam. We only have to clear that one
if we want to ask another question. It also tells us something. Their vacation destination
must be further from you than their current location. So... So it means
he must be this way. Is the dentist that way?
Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to search the park? 'Cause it would take 24 minutes
to walk to this dental clinic. So it'd be almost,
you know, 50 minutes. We've split the thing in two,
and we know he's in the woods. I reckon we
Let's... How much woods is there? I think it's... At least we're getting in here and starting looking before we walk
half an hour back that way. Is that up there,
is that a public path? That seems like
it goes into the... park. Yeah, it says, it seems like
this is the way, yeah. Check this out? That, said, get in and out,
whether it's this way or the park. I don't know, Sam.
These woods are dense. Yeah, but he has to be
near a path. Yeah. Is it this way? (mutters indistinctly) They're right behind me. Look there, Ben. He's literally right there. Aah! Ohh! I was so scared! I was so scared
we would be in the woods for so... many hours. Ladies and gentlemen,
we got him. How did you know
to come here? You're gonna hate this. I looked along... We narrowed it down to
all the options out of here. I was looking along here
for bits of forest. Areas where you can get
to forest near here. I saw ""Castle Site.""
""Adam's gonna love that."" And then I clicked on,
and then the first thing I saw in the station photo
had the building that you sent in the background. And that was like, that's that. Well, this sucks. Okay, I'm gonna go.
Good bye! Bye, Sam. Good luck. See you on Saturday. This is so (bleep)-ed up
what just happened. That you left Utsunomiya
and went directly to me. You had— There were
two prefectures that I could have
been in at that point! And you found the exact station? Alright. I made it
to my hiding spot. And I've done something
so dumb... that I think it
might just be genius. I've come to the airport! Caption+ by JS*

secret hiding location. I frankly have no idea
how they are going to find me. Good luck! Welcome to
hide-and-seek across Japan. We're the Seekers,
we're in Tokyo, and Ben is... Where am I, you ask? That's the whole show. It's hide—
We're playing hide-and-seek. And so you don't know
where I am. Welcome to our six-day game
of hide-and-seek across Japan. The goal of this game is simple:
Hide for as long as you can without being found. Right now, Adam and I are
starting in Tokyo as the Seekers, while the first Hider, Ben,
had three and a half hours to find a hiding spot
somewhere else in the country. In order to find him, we'll have to piece together
information about his location using these 62 questions
in our giant question menu. Ben has to answer these
questions truthfully, but in exchange, he'll get to draw cards
from the Hider Deck, giving him big advantages
like Time Bonuses or Curses that can slow the Seekers down. Once we find Ben,
positions will rotate, and it will be
someone else's turn to hide. After the end of six days, the player with the longest
single hiding run wins. We'll go over all the
nitty gritty rules later. For now, Ben's clock is ticking. So Adam and I need to
figure out what to ask so we can start moving
in Ben's direction. Okay. Here is our map.
You, the audience, are seeing a digital
version of the map. So Sam, the bad news is that
I think that from Tokyo Station, you can get further in
three and a half hours than from any other
place in the world. So, I sort of think the
first thing we need to do is make sure that he's not just... somewhere in the
greater Tokyo area. Well, I think the one-two punch
that we would want is: confirm he's not in
the Tokyo metro area, and then we need a direction. Okay, so now that
we've got our strategy, we need to start
asking some questions. In this game, our questions are
broken into six simple tools. Matching questions allow us to check
whether something about our location is the same or different
from Ben's. Like, is his prefecture
the same as ours? Is his nearest major city
the same as ours? Things like that. Measuring questions are similar,
but they allow us to check whether something is closer to
or further from Ben than it is from us. Like, is he closer
to a Shinkansen line? That's the bullet train,
by the way. Is he closer to a coastline, etc. The Thermometer – a new tool in this
version of hide-and-seek – allows us to ask
whether we're getting hotter or colder to Ben's location after we've traveled
a certain distance. The Radar can check
whether Ben is or isn't within a certain distance of us, and Photo questions allow us to ask Ben for
a photo of something, like a bridge or the
tallest mountain he can see. Finally, we've got Tentacles, a new tool for dealing
with dense metro areas that we'll get into
once it's relevant. The point is, there are
a lot of different ways we can approach this,
but we've gotta do it quickly. I'm a little bit tempted, Sam,
to plop down a 50-mile Radar. Okay, so 50 miles
gets us to Odawara. That would be this.
100 would be a decent bit further. I don't hate 100. I mean, 100 for us
would confirm that he is... He has definitely Shinkansen'd
his way out of here. I... agree with you. Should we hit it?
Okay. Let's ask if he is
within 100 miles of us. So I'm allowed to wander around
a little bit in my hiding zone. There's a sort of town nearby
at the bottom of this mountain. So I'm gonna go check that out 'cause when I started
climbing up this mountain, I was ignoring all kinds of signs that were translating like
""Violent monkeys"", ""The monkeys will try
and attack you on sight."" I'm gonna be honest.
I have been hearing monkeys. So I think that
if I stay in here longer, I might be killed by monkeys. Oh, slippery. (hard scraping)
(grunts) Oh, okay, we've got
our first question. It is a 100-mile Radar
from Tokyo Station. And let me tell you... That's gonna be a miss. I am not within
100 miles of Tokyo. So let's go ahead
and let 'em know. Oh. It's a miss. Okay, so he is not
within 100 miles of us. So we're... Let's measure that and
mark it on the map. A Radar, which
they've just asked, is worth two cards. So that means that I get to look
at the top two cards of the deck... and draw one of them
into my hand. So, the top two cards
are gonna be... a five-minute bonus
and a discard two, draw three. Now, the five minute bonus...
I mean, it is an extra five minutes. But I think ultimately
down the line, the discard two, draw three
is going to be more useful. So we're going to
go ahead and keep that. Pretty exciting. Oh, and, I should mention. We're selling this. We've finally designed a
version of hide-and-seek that can be played
pretty much anywhere. You can get the Hider Deck
and all the other goodies you need to play this yourself,
wherever you are in the world. Do I have anything else to say?
No, you should do that. You should buy
this product, please. Here is what I... kind of think we should do. There are three Shinkansen lines
that require going north and one requiring going south. I think we should head up north. And then we can ask
if we're hotter or colder. And what that would do is... That would successfully
draw us a line... that totally cuts off this Shinkansen line
that goes sort of west. So we need to start
that question now, basically. We'll start it now,
and then we'll go and ask for hotter or colder.
Okay. I think we should
hop on a Shinkansen so that if we decide
we want to keep going, we're already on the fastest train. This one? We just have to get in
a non-reserved car. Let's go ahead
and step on it, Sam. Yeah. We've sort of learned
from Ben's mistakes. Little update.
I hear the monkeys. They're louder.
I think they're getting closer. I do not want to die
at the hand of a monkey. I d... I... I know that this may not
be politically correct, but I would fight a monkey ...if I had to fight it. Oh, what the (bleep) is that?
Okay, let's go. (slips, hits ground) Goodbye, Tokyo. Alright.
Just the station. Goodbye, Tokyo Station. We've gone a half mile.
Can you text? Yeah. Now we will know which... basically which side
of this line Ben is on. If we're hotter, right,
that means we went the right way. He's up here.
If we're colder, right... then he went that way. There's a town right down there
on the bottom of the mountain. I'm gonna try and go down there. No, I can't deal with this. Okay, so it looks like
they've just used the Thermometer tool
to go a half-mile north and see if they've
gotten hotter or colder. And let me tell you... They're hotter. Now they know that
they need to go north. So, the moves they're making,
they make a lot of sense, but they still got
a big area to cover. And let me tell you. The next move that they make
is going to matter a lot. Oh, Sam.
Hotter. We are hotter. I am really glad because the thing about this map is that... while this might be
our hotter direction, this is geography's
hotter direction. Yes, it is
less dense that way. It's less dense the way we're going. I mean the weather. Oh sure, oh yeah. It's going to be colder
if we get up there. That's true. Well, we're hotter, which is great. It means we're going
the right way. Yeah. Now, I think we'll
continue up to Ōmiya. Then the question will be,
do we stay on this line, which goes more northwest? Or are we going to
need to switch at Ōmiya and get on the Shinkansen
that goes northeast? The Niigata line... There's not a whole lot
in that direction. There's not. Okay, well... Now that I have answered their... Thermometer question... I get to look at
the next two cards. We've got: Curse of the
Impressionable Consumer and Curse of the
Mediocre Travel Agent. Wow, okay, two Curses. So, just really quick,
a note on how Curses work. These are cards that Ben can keep in his hand
and play against us when he thinks they'd be
most advantageous. Both of these Curses do
something to slow us down. Curse of the Impressionable Consumer
forces us to go buy something that we've seen in an advertisement
before we can ask another question. And Curse of the
Mediocre Travel Agent allows Ben to send us off
to a location of his choice and fetch him a souvenir. These are both quite useful, but they also both
have casting costs that level the playing field. The first Curse makes
our next question free, and the second Curse could
potentially give away some hugely valuable information,
because the place Ben sends us needs to be further from him
than our current location. In this game, choosing
the right Curses and casting them at the right time
is a crucial part of Hider strategy. These are both pretty decent. So, the Curse of the
Impressionable Consumer... basically means that
they gotta go out and they gotta find
an ad for something and they gotta go buy it. That's gonna be really
easy to do in Tokyo. Curse of the Mediocre Travel Agent basically just means
that I can send them a half-mile off on a little
adventure at any time. So I think that...
I'm gonna take that one. I think that I can use that
to maybe screw them on a train later
or something, yeah. I think that is—
I think that's the one that I'm gonna keep. He didn't. Oh, he waved back. He waved back.
He did? Yeah.
That's awesome. Okay, Sam.
Here is the deal with this. We need to find Ben.
Well, yes. This is a big decision point. Basically, I would really like
for us to figure out which Shinkansen to take without having to actually
take one to check. Yeah, you want to see
how long it takes to get between Niigata and Sendai? Oh, god. We need to figure out
how to slice this map properly. Do we want to just... YOLO it.
Go to Shin-Shirakawa and ask if we're in
the right region? I kinda... I'm not against the idea of
just going significantly north. But again, but as you said,
if we're in Sendai, and we have to get to Niigata... Well, we're gonna
have to backtrack. We'd have to backtrack
all the way, for sure. There's gotta be a
better question to ask. Okay. We've made it to town. I don't really know what
they got going on here, but let's try and figure it out. (water rushing) I don't even know why
I set up this shot. (hums staccato rhythm) What are they doing? I seem to be correct. I think they have
gotten off in Ōmiya. So they're going to hit me
with a question soon. I don't— I do not know
what it's going to be. But if they cannot figure out
what line to go up... they could be putting themselves
in a very risky situation. And let me tell you this.
Clock is ticking, boys. You know, for every minute that you can't figure out
what to ask me... that's just more time for me. You know what we should do? I know what we should do. Maybe. If we go this way... we could do a
hotter-colder here... and then that would
totally cut that off. Mmm. I'm just saying. The problem is,
we have to waste an hour that we will never get back. Right, but we risk
losing three hours. Or we can make a judgment call. My opinion is that we
should reduce our risk right now. Because it's
the one single run that wins it all.
Well— So it's really bad
to do high-risk and then be wrong.
I think I'm fine with that. I'd also be fine with risky,
but I agree that it is this early good to be risk averse. Okay, yes, text him?
Yeah. Folks, they've started
a Thermometer. Who cares?
They don't know what's going on. They're done, okay?
There's— They have no clue. I want to address something, okay?
I need to address something. Before the game started,
Adam was like, ""You should not wear
that jumpsuit."" Because it looks like
the flag of Imperial Japan. And... I was trying to do
a Where's Waldo thing, but I do— I feel like I
need to go on the record. I do not endorse.... that era of... Japanese governance, okay? I do not like Imperial Japan. Emperor Hirohito, okay,
I'm calling your ass out. You should not'a done
that stuff. Wee! Train. Alright.
Alright. Sam, welcome to...
Hanagawa, I think. A place that is
five miles west of Ōmiya. Let's ask Ben if
we are hotter or colder. Adam and Sam have
finished their Thermometer. I'm afraid... It's colder.
They did not go the right way. Which is to say,
am I off of the Niigata line? No, I'm not. I'm off of a different line. You still got a lot
of map left to look. So... Sorry! Alright.
You wanna see the answer? Yeah. Okay. Well...
So he's colder. What does that mean, Adam? Well, it means that
we probably should have gotten on that other train. But it's good—
I told you— I'm just kidding. It's good that we checked. It is good that we checked.
Now we know. Now we know. So now we should just go back
and do the other thing. I just want to record
the clip now for later, where I say,
""I feel like Ben is here."" Look, if Ben is there... that's gonna really suck for us. Yeah, the one flaw
with this plan is there are places where
the fastest way to get them is through Niigata.
Yeah. But are on the
other side of our line because we just couldn't
get a perfect angle. And that would be... I wouldn't love it. For the audience's perspective,
it would be hilarious. It would be very funny. Alright.
Shall we get back on our train? Yeah. Let's run it back. Let's see what we got here. Ooh, it's another Curse.
Oh my goodness. Curse of the Ransom Note. Curse of the Ransom Note. The next question
that the Seekers ask must be composed of
words and letters cut out of any printed material. Casting cost: Spell out
""Curse of the Ransom Note"" as a ransom note. Or a 10 minute bonus. I mean, 10 guaranteed minutes.
That's not nothing. There are a lot of Curses that probably cannot
take 10 minutes. This is a tough one. I'm gonna take
Curse of the Ransom Note for now. I might discard it later because it's not
a very powerful one. But, I guess it's better to just have, if I need it, rather than a 10 minute bonus.
So I'm going to take the Curse. Either way, it's both
pretty good options, and... We're doing good.
We're doing good, okay? Don't worry. Okay, so, this is our map. But the good news is, that with the
3 ½ hours that he had, he could not have gotten
to the island of Hokkaido. So we can eliminate that. Meaning that he's
somewhere... on here. Okay, so we have a pretty good transfer onto the fastest Shinkansen up to Sendai.
Yeah. That gets us kind of in
the center of what is left. Yeah.
And Sendai is a big hub. Yeah. So I think that seems right.
I agree. One thing I think we
should do now though, is I would like to request
a picture from Ben. It takes 15 minutes
for him to answer. Yeah. So it's good
for us to do it now while we aren't doing anything. Is he in a denser place?
Is he in a really rural place? Yeah. Knowing that
might be kind of useful. There's a few interesting
pictures we could request. We probably
want the ones that... have the highest likelihood of
just bleedover info, basically. Yeah. I think
that we should do... five buildings.
Yeah. Which has to include
the bottom and up to four stories. That's going to give us,
if you're in a rural place, you're going to show us quite a bit.
Yeah. I think I like five buildings.
Okay. Request photo of five buildings? Sure.
Alright. I will let him know. Let's make Ben work.
Yeah. It looks like Sam and Adam are heading back to Ōmiya Station. Which makes sense. They are probably gonna
go get on the Shinkansen. Ooh, okay.
They've asked me a Photo question. They want a photo of five buildings. See, the thing is, I really,
to the best of my ability... want to avoid showing mountains. Because that's gonna give
them a lot of information. I think there's a view. If I just make sure that
I crop it below there where you can't see the mountains. Or maybe this way. Okay, yeah, I think there's
definitely an angle here where if you just, you're
pointed away from the mountains, you can go boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom. I think I can make this work. So I'm gonna go ahead
and take this picture and... send it over to them. (clicks) Alright, welcome, back
to Ōmiya, Sam. Ben has sent us a picture
of five buildings. Yeah, we have a
relatively quick transfer. So let's just get on the train
and then analyze it, maybe? Yeah.
But, quick reaction is small. Train. Twaaain! This train's
about to go real fast. It's gonna go so fast, Adam. It's sort of one of
the fastest trains around. I don't think you understand
how fast this train's about to go. Okay, Sam. Let's take a look at the picture ...that Ben sent us. It's giving... town. There are multiple people
out and about. You know the one
thing I'm noticing? This. Yeah. Kind of looks like
a tourist shop. It...
'Cause... Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised if he
went somewhere modestly touristy because it has
a really cool thing. Yeah, if I were Ben,
what I would do to find the location would be like, prettiest
small towns in Japan. You know... We're almost three hours in and we haven't been hit
by a single Curse yet. It is somewhat frightening. He's probably saving up. Yeah. Okay. So I provided them their photo which means that I get
to draw another card. Since it's just a photo, I don't get to look at
the top cards or anything. I just have to draw
one from the top, and that's the card I get, so... Curse of the Jammed Door. Curse of the Jammed Door. For the next three hours,
the Seekers must roll dice to pass through a doorway. Casting cost: Discard a card. That's a pretty fun one. I'm not sure where
that'll be most useful. But I'll hold on to it. I got quite
an arsenal cookin'. The train is going very fast. The train is going
really fast. Wild, premature guess, but... I do know from research... that this coast... is quite touristy. Mm, okay. Well, let me just throw
something out there. If we wanted to... we could ask him to send a picture
of his biggest body of water. And if he is on the coast,
that'd be a huge hit. I mean... Interpreting quite a lot
from quite little, but... coastal town... you're gonna want
an ice cream vendor. I know, that's what I think. You want to do it?
Yeah. Okay. Here's your photo. Alright, you send it.
Go for it. Oh! Okay, they've asked me for a photo
of my largest body of water. I am almost certain
that it is this... this river here. Let's go take a photo of the river. I don't know what they're
trying to do with that, but... Maybe they're trying to... figure out if I'm
right on the ocean? The name of the game... is just to take a picture with as little extra
information as I can. Okay. I think I can get
a good pic here that really doesn't say
a whole lot. That doesn't say much. No. That is a—
That's a river. Yeah. Okay, well that's useless. Alright, well, there's
another picture for them. Does mean I get to
draw another card. Alright, hopefully,
I got something good. Let's see. Oh! It's another Curse! Curse of the Lemon Phylactery. Before asking another question,
the Seekers must each find a lemon and affix it to the outermost layer
of their clothes or skin. Casting cost: Discard a Powerup. I do like this Curse. I wanna put it on 'em.
I wanna hit 'em with it. You know, I wanna hit 'em with it. I think that there's
a very good chance that... this will slow them down
and annoy them greatly. And honestly, if they're on
the Shinkansen right now, and I put this on them, it means that they're
not going to be able to ask me another question
until they get off the train and go deal with this. So, I am gonna... I'm gonna cast it. Now, the only problem is that in order to cast it, I have to discard a Powerup,
meaning I have to discard my discard two, draw three.
That's fine. I'm going to go ahead and
play that on them now. We got a photo.
We received a photo. It's a Curse. Nngh-kay.
Well, I tell you what. This means we can't do the thing
where we ask a question while we're still on the train.
True. That is smart.
I have to give him that. You, I think, are
a very experienced... affixing items to your body player. Well, we both have to do this. Oh, yeah, sure. Okay, fine. Yeah. Damn. Okay, so while Sam and Adam deal with strapping
lemons to their bodies... I'm gonna go find some food. It seems like there's
a couple restaurants in this little town, so,
let's see what there is to eat. So, hello. Do you want to know
where I am? It turns out that this whole time,
I have been hiding... in The Snack Zone. Today on The Snack Zone,
we are going to be eating... uhhhh... Boo, whoa. Uhm... That tastes the way that being shot in the eye
with a laser feels. Not only are we out here... enjoying this thing... But we're also, we're
cooking up some plans. Because I've still got three Curses in my hand. So we've got
Curse of the Ransom Note. Makes them ask their next question
as a ransom note. Curse of the Jammed Door. Prevents them from
getting into buildings. Curse of the Mediocre Travel Agent. Sends them somewhere
they don't want to go when they don't want to go there. It looks like they're
taking the train all the way up to Sendai. They're gonna get off
the train in Sendai. Once they get off
the train in Sendai, they're going to have to
attach lemons to themselves. So they're going to
leave the train station. Then, boom. You hit them with
Curse of the Jammed Door. Hopefully, you lock them
out of the train station. Maybe they'll just be able to get
right back in the train station, but hopefully you can
at least delay them getting back in
the train station. Then... Here's where it gets good. Then, if we can identify
what train they want to get on... out of the station... that's when we hit them with
Curse of the Mediocre Travel Agent. We wait until that train
is about to leave, send them right back
out of the station. I think that if I play my Curses
at the right time in Sendai, I can trap them there
for quite a while. And hopefully prevent them
from gaining any more information for a while, so... Sam, welcome to Sendai.
Do you feel that? It's not as hot. It's a reasonable
temperature here! This rules!
Thank you, Ben! You ready to go find a lemon? Yeah, let's go find a lemon. (sighs)
Alright, it looks like Sam and Adam
have made it to Sendai. And they're probably
out looking for lemons. As soon as they get
those lemons attached, I am going to hit them
with the Jammed Door Curse. My hope is that it's going to make getting back into the train station
a huge pain. Unless they could find
lemons in the train station, which would be bad. Whoa! Are there lemons here? There are oranges. Unfortunately, those are oranges.
Oranges, but no lemons. Oh, that's brutal! Well, the other thing is
we have to go to more of a general store
anyway to get tape. True. Oh, that weather is amazing.
Oh, wow, this is incredible. Alright, Sam, so... The key here is we really
need to attach these robustly. Because if they fall off,
it's an hour penalty. My thinking? Here. No, I disagree with that.
What? Your arms are moving
all around all the time. Well, yeah, but,
this is the thing you're going to pay
most attention to. It's small.
I think we can get a really good, strong fix. Okay. You want it—
I think that way is better. (tape squeaking) Whoa, go slow and clean.
Okay, okay. Methodical. (tape squeaking) Oh yeah, that's not going anywhere. Oh, you have hair in your arms. It's gonna suck more
at the end for you. Yeah. You gotta do the crisscross. Yeah, no, I totally am
with you on the crisscross. (chuckles)
(tape squeaking) Yeah, no, that's quite secure.
How long is it? It's an hour. Easy. No-no-no. No, it's just, it's at any point. Oh wait, really? We have to keep it
for the rest— until we find Ben.
I didn't realize that. Yeah.
Okay, well. (bleep) Alright. Well, it looks like they've got their
lemons attached, so... I'm going to hit them with
the Curse of the Jammed Door. I don't know if that's going
to really do a whole lot, but it should at least
slow 'em down a little bit. So now I think
that we want to ask a Matching question. And we have been
talking on the train. I think we want to do
nearest Shinkansen line. Great idea. However... We are once again Cursed. Wait, really? Curse of the Jammed Door. For the next three hours, whenever the Seekers want
to pass through a doorway into a building, business,
train, or other vehicle, they must first roll two dice. If they do not roll seven or higher,
they cannot enter that space. Any given doorway can be
reattempted after 15 minutes. Three hours!? Jesus! I'm starting a timer now.
Yeah. That's a lot,
that's many hours. We can still ask our question.
Yes. Which is, if
his nearest Shinkansen is the same as our
nearest Shinkansen. So ours is this big green one. If the answer is yes,
it's like, okay, yeah, he's in this area that we're in. If the answer is no,
I would say that that is bad news. And, means that he's
either closest to this one, or he's in the hell area
where he actually is over here. I think he's in the hell area. (sighs) It's possible. It'd be funniest.
I mean, that seems like the kind of thing we'd
write in the script. So let's ask him that. The next train to where I am leaves their station pretty soon. Oh... okay. Okay, so they just asked me if their closest Shinkansen
is the same as theirs or not. Now, it's not, because... I am closer to the line
that goes up to Yamagata. That's gonna tell them
a lot of information. And I think it's going to tell them
to get on the train out of Sendai that I don't want them to get on.
That train leaves... in about 15 minutes, so... I think that what I'm
going to do now... is I'm going to send
them on a little... send them on a little vacation. And if I can time that
quick enough... I should hopefully get
them to miss that train. The answer is no. (bleep)
Which is a bit of a curveball. (bleep), okay. Okay. Well, hey, it's good
we know that! It is? I mean... (bleep) All signs point to
he's on that purple line. I mean, the thing is,
we can get to that line in an hour. Yeah, it's not so bad. Okay, for what it's worth... Oh, we got another one. (sighs) Oh, god. Curse of the
Mediocre Travel Agent. The Seekers must go to the
Hider's chosen location, spend at least 10 minutes there,
and acquire a souvenir before asking another question. The location must be further
from the Seekers than the Hider. What I was literally
about to mention was that the next train
across to the purple line leaves in ten minutes. (wheezes) Great.
Well, let's get walking. Yeah, okay, well...
Awesome. Okay, so now that I've answered
that Shinkansen question, it does mean that I get
to look at the top three and draw another one. So, hopefully I get
something good in here. Okay. Ten minute bonus. Curse of the Distant Cuisine. Curse of the Distant Cuisine. Find a restaurant within your zone
that explicitly serves food from a specific foreign country. The seekers must visit a restaurant
serving food from a country that is equal or
greater distance away before asking another question. And Curse of the Drained Brain. Curse of the Drained Brain. Choose three questions
in different categories. The seekers cannot
ask those questions for the rest of your run. Casting cost: Discard your hand. I don't know what to do. Okay. So I've been—
Okay, so, between these three... 10 minute bonus,
it's just not that big of a bonus. Curse of the Distant Cuisine, it's gonna give them
too much information. I don't want to tell them about
any restaurants that are here. Curse the Drained Brain, I do think I could use
this in the endgame. Because I do think that
I can eliminate three questions that would be really useful once they actually get here. Alright, we're
almost at the stupid park. Why are you already
badmouthing the park? No, I'm sure
the park will be nice. Alright Sam, we have to
enjoy a ten-minute vacation and find a souvenir. Wheeeeee! Whee! Whee! Whee! Look. I am not making this up. The monkeys are dastardly. So, I've been looking
for hiding spots for a little while now. I haven't really found
anything perfect, but there are a lot
of these really... amazing temples here.
They're really something. I mean, how cool is that? It's just, I think this whole
area where I am right now with all these amazing temples,
it's like too obvious, you know? I think that...
this is why people come here. So I need to find something... really off the beaten path. Something that
they're not going to just immediately
sort of gravitate to. I think I'm going to keep looking. Oh! Oh!
Awh! Okay, should we
look for a souvenir? The thing is, there's
so little litter here. Yeah, there's not a lot here. I mean, we could bring
him a wonderful leaf. There's a little rock.
That is a rock. You know, that's a nice gift. Here's a bigger rock.
It does have a better shape. I do agree that this
is a better rock. Alright, I think
we can do this rock. So, the second
that our timer is done, we want to hit him with the... with the Radar, right?
Which one? Yeah, what are you doing?
The 50 mile Radar— Peeling. You're gonna eat it?
I was peeling it for you. Oh, okay.
Well, that's an interesting choice. So we want to hit him
with the 50 mile Radar as soon as we're done, right? I believe yes. Well, the nice thing is,
given how much we've eliminated, if we hit him with
the 50 mile Radar, and it's a hit, then that's actually
a pretty small area. And we probably
want to take that line over to that line.
Yeah, probably. Oh, god. I knew it was going
to be really sour. But it was a lot more
sour than I thought. Oh, jeez. Alright, well, our time is up. Alright, hit him
with the radar quickly before he can Curse us again.
Alright, alright, alright, alright. Let's— Okay.
Let's go back to the station. Tell you what,
my lemon is itchin'. Okay, so they've just
hit me with a 50 mile Radar. So before I answer that, I'm gonna hit him with the
Curse the Drained Brain. Because my hand is empty right now. So I basically don't
have to pay for this. It's kind of the
perfect time to play it. So I'm going to get rid of photo of the tallest building
from my train station, the train service question, where they can see if their train
would stop at my station. Both of those are really
going to help them figure out exactly what my station is,
which I don't want them to do. And then I'm also
going to get rid of the quarter mile Radar, because it's very useful
in the endgame. So, those three
they cannot... now ask. ♪ I was waiting for love ♪ Oh, Ben. What? Curse of the Drained Brain. The Seekers cannot
ask three questions of the Hider's choice
for the rest of the run. He has banned three
very useful questions. For how long?
For the rest of the run?! Yeah.
Who wrote that question? It's tough. But the 50 mile Radar
was a hit. I am within 50 miles of them. So they've got the map
quite small now, which really emphasizes
to me that... I've gotta find a hiding spot. Ooh, it's a hit.
Okay, that's good news. Okay, so we probably want to
jump over to that line then, right? Yeah, probably. The good news is we have him in a not that huge area. Probably. Now that I've
answered their Radar, I do get to at least look
at the top two and draw one. Ugh, give me something
good, please. Okay.
Curse of the Unguided Tourist. Curse of the Unguided Tourist. Send the seekers an unzoomed
Google Street View image from a street within 500 feet
of where they are now. Without using
the internet for research, they must find what you
sent them in real life before they can use transportation
or ask another question. And a discard two, draw three. So Curse of the Unguided Tourist, that could be useful to
basically prevent them from getting on a train again. Discard two, draw three. I just don't think
that's going to be that useful to me now, so... I'm going to keep this Curse,
and hopefully... it can come in handy later. Okay, Sam.
So this is the entrance. Do you have it zoomed in
so we'll be able to see it? I would hold it, I would maybe—
This square. This square?
Yep. Nice job, Adam. We can go in.
That's not the last hurdle. We can go in. We don't know if we can
get on the train yet, but we can go in the station
and roll for the train. I found a giant bowl of soup. I don't know why it's here, but... maybe I could hide in
the giant bowl of soup. What are Sam and Adam up to? Are they going on a train? Are they coming for me? Which platform was it? Was it three or four?
Seven. To Yamagata, that's us?
Believe so. Okay, then
I need to roll the dice. Alright. Alright. That's bad.
That's brutal. Well... We've got more time to
formulate a strategy. It kinda looks like
they're not on the train. No. They're still in Sendai. Which either means that they
have not yet figured out the line that they need to go on... I mean, I guess the other option is that maybe the
Curse of the Jammed Door locked them out of the train. That'd be pretty... That'd be pretty... Pretty spicy. (giggles) That's brutal. Wow, this is really brutal. We need to figure out
what the (bleep) to do here. Huh? We need to figure out
what to do. Here's what I think
we should do, Sam. While we have all this time... We could ask for a Strava map
with the six turns and we could try matching
it to all the places. I was going to
mention Strava map. We know Strava map is useful. Yeah, okay. Look. Ben has gifted us with time. Let's use it. Okay, so just to be clear,
what we're going to ask for is... he has to walk
a half-mile on Strava and make six turns
and then send us a picture of that outline.
Yeah. And then we're going
to try to match it... Let's do it.
to the streets on the map. Okay.
Shall I text? Yeah, go for it. I feel like I'm already
kinda out of the way out here. But I'm gonna keep looking around. I know that it might seem obvious
that I should just go back... up the mountain where
the monkeys are. But it's... not that hard to find that place.
There are not that many paths. It doesn't really
branch off all that much. I actually don't think it would be
that hard for them to find me if I went up that mountain. Look, it sounds like copium. It sounds like I'm
scared of the monkeys. I gotta be honest,
I'm scared as hell of the monkeys. Oh, I'm so scared of
those monkeys, man. But I do think that
I can find a perfect spot. I can find a place that
they're just not gonna go. Strava map? Really? Okay. They are going to
try and match it up. And I guess there probably just aren't that many
spots remaining... that they could check. And so this is going to be
a decent way of confirming, but... We'll see. While we wait, Adam, I'm looking into the
kind of furthest extent he could have gotten
in his time yesterday. Yeah. So he started at 3 pm, and he had to be in
his spot by 6:30 pm. Yeah.
So theoretically... he could have taken
this 3 pm Shinkansen, but that terminated in Yamagata. At what time?
5:46. So, he would have
only had 45 minutes. So, this is really useful. So, he needs somewhere within a 45 minute
radius of Yamagata. Well, let me see.
So, like, so, Shinjō... He could not
have gotten to Shinjō. Could he have gotten to
any of the stops before Shinjō? Yes, he could have gotten... as far as Higashine. Higashine, yeah, I see that. So, eliminate everything north. Yeah, so that's good.
So this is great. So we can exclude...
If you're right... we can exclude all of this. So that means then, Sam,
it's actually very limited. He could be on this
part of this line that we're about to go on. He could be on these—
this Shinkansen. He could be on this line,
or he could be a little down here. But that's not a lot.
No, I mean... That's quite limited. This is gonna help our
Strava searching, I think. Yeah. I think that with the Strava,
we might be able to lock it in. Okay. We're walking. We are walking. You know how we be. Ugh. I should have eaten something
other than that melon thing. We've come back to
the end of the platform because we're about to
get the Strava answer. Let's make sure that we
have looked at all the lines because the transfers
could exclude stuff that is unintuitive.
Yeah. What about the line that
goes up from Yonezawa? Okay, no. So he couldn't have
taken that line either. So this line out of Yamagata,
the transfer was after 6:30. Okay. So that's eliminated. So I actually think he has to be
either on the Shinkansen or on the line
we're about to take. Yeah. These are looking strong for—
This is going better for us than we thought it was, honestly.
Almost uncomfortably so. I actually think
he is going to be on the line we're about to take. Because I don't think he
would do a Shinkansen stop. It is— It would be weird
to do a Shinkansen, but... these towns are just like nothing. I don't know, Sam.
I mean, Yamadera? That's exactly what
I'm looking at, actually. Because it has a lot
of tourist shops. It has stuff.
It's definitely touristy. I mean, I like
the sound of Yamadera. ♪ Walkin' ♪ Well, that is Strava done. Oof, alright, well, means
I get to draw another card. Oof, okay. Discard two, draw three. Not really that useful right now. Maybe later. Okay, he has sent
the Strava map. That's an interesting shape. No, I mean, this Strava
shape definitely changes my thinking about this line. Oku-Nikkawa? Doesn't match that at all.
He's not in Takase. Let's check Yama—Yama
whatever the (bleep). Oh, yeah.
Yes, that's it. Oh, yeah.
That's it. You see that? Oh, yeah! That is it.
Yamadera, yeah. Benjamin Doyle! I believe that Benjamin Doyle
is at Yamadera station. Your goose is cooked!
We've cooked your goose, Ben! Alright, well, back to
looking for a hiding spot. Just gonna keep looking. And as soon as they
start heading this way... I'll just have to pick.
Okay, so, we know where he is. Yes.
It's a very small town. Well, let's say we believe
we know where he is. We know where he is. Adam, explain to me what your... emotional wellbeing is gonna be like
if we are not allowed on this train and have to wait on this platform
for another hour. It's not gonna be good. And the thing is, there's a really
real chance that it happens. Yeah.
An almost 50% chance. Yeah, and it'd be funny, so...
Well, yeah. It'll be nice to
take these lemons off. I gotta tell you. I'm not feeling good
about this dice roll. No, no, me neither.
Not at all. No.
Do you want to do it? I think you should do it.
That way we can blame it on you. Here it is, yeah. You ready? The doors are here. So nice up here. It's like I got hit with
a wave of tranquility. I think that this is a museum. Oh! I think it's a Bashō Museum. The famed poet. Oh. Wait, now that I'm Bashō,
I'm gonna write a haiku. Writing poetry is hard. Come on, come on, come on. Oh my god. Well. When's the next one? It's another hour.
Hey, but good news, Adam. The Curse will
be over by then? I think so.
Awesome. You wanna go look around?
Yeah. Got another hour. Here's an option. This bridge here is
pretty out of the way. I've gone sort of down
the road randomly. I have never— I have
not seen this bridge in all the time that I've been here. That's kind of tranquil. Nah, I'm gonna keep going.
I'm gonna keep going. What are Sam and Adam up to? They should be on a
train heading my way now. Oh my god, they're still in Sendai. They must have rolled bad again. Oh my god. (chuckles) Oh my god. Oh, I'm so sorry. That is brutal. Okay, well... I think I might go
get some food then. I bought you a sweet treat.
Oh, thank you. It's very thoughtful.
Let's go outside and try it. Welcome to this episode of
Choo Choo Chew Derailed. Welcome to The Snack Zone!
No. Today, we're trying these
seemingly mochi coated strawberries. I guess. Four dollars. I mean, that is luxurious.
Mmm. Ooh, things could
not be going better! I do not know exactly
what this is. Ooh. Ooh. Oh, that's delightful. Oh! Alright, let's finally
take our stupid train. Yeah, our Curse clears with three minutes to spare, right?
Yeah. We're pretty lucky
with the timing. Can you believe it, Sam?
We're finally leaving Sendai. It's been.... I think, four hours?
♪ It's been ♪ Huh? You know,
in that song, ""One Week""? ♪ It's been ♪ Alright, well, it looks like
Sam and Adam are on the move and they're heading towards me. Given how long they've
had with that Strava map, I've gotta just assume the worst. And assume that they
know exactly where I am and that they're
coming straight for me. So here's the situation. I've been scouring
every inch of my zone. It is tempting to want
to go into the woods, but there are kinda
three different trails that I could take.
There's this one... But in order to get up there,
you gotta go through this temple, and that closes soon,
so I can't do that. It's the same situation
with this one. This is where I started the day, but you gotta go through
the cemetery to get there. The cemetery also
does seem to close. I went up here... to the trail by the Bashō Museum. But that just seemed to be... The trails seem to be closed, so... I think that I kind of
have no choice but to hide somewhere in town. So, I've got about an hour before they get to me. I'm gonna scope out
the rest of town and just see if I can find a really good nook to hide in. Hopefully, I can buy myself
some more time when they get here. Yeah, we're getting
into the mountains now, so it'll be more scenic. Okay. Hello. I think that I may have
found my hiding spot. I'm right here at
the edge of my zone. There's this bridge right here.
Right under there. And, well, I mean, first of all, this looks cool as hell.
But also, bridges. All of these bridges that
I've seen in this zone look pretty much identical. And so, if they use photos to determine that
I'm under a bridge, it's actually probably not
going to be that helpful. Because there are
quite a few bridges. And if they're checking
all of them, this is going to be one of
the last ones that they check. So I think that there's
a very good chance that that will buy me
a bunch of extra time. Let's go down there
and scope it out. Yeah. Oh, I kind of love this. I think this might be my spot. I think I'm just going
to post up here for now. If they get off my station,
and the endgame starts, then... good luck finding me. Gotta hope that I can buy
myself some extra time. Okay, this is nice. Looks like a good spot. Alright, Adam. Yeah?
We are going to arrive in... six minutes. So we need to decide when
we're getting him with what. Yes. I think the second we get there, we need a picture approximately
of his hiding location. Because the worst case scenario is
he gets us with some Curse. And we need the ability to
just search without a Curse. The three smart options
are photo of him, photo straight up, photo of the tallest
thing he can see. If he's in the woods,
he's in the woods. All the pictures will
show the same thing, except for maybe the tallest thing,
because maybe he can see the shrine from the woods.
Yeah. And then we can figure out
what angle he's looking at it from. Yeah.
So I think we go with that. Yeah. Okay, let's try tallest structure. What are the odds that
we're just completely wrong? Not zero. Whew. Alright. Well, it looks like Sam
and Adam are almost here. Seeing as they haven't really
asked any more questions, I figure that they're probably... they've probably figured
out that I'm here. So, I think they're
gonna be here momentarily and start searching for me.
But you know what? I'm in my lane. I'm flourishing. I got my Curses.
I got my tracker. I got my snake. Oh my god, it moved.
Oh my god, no. Alright, let's hope this is it. Let's do it in
five... four... three... two... one....
We have everything? Okay.
Hit it. Wow, the weather
here is amazing. Yeah, I think we might
be going up some stairs. Yeah, now if
you look in Google, it's like the famous
1,000 steps of wherever the (bleep)
or something. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's up there for sure. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. For sure. Well, it would seem that... they've arrived.
And the endgame has begun. They immediately went ahead
and asked for a photo of the tallest building I can see. And, the tallest building I can see is this bridge, so... There you go. I'm gonna send them
the photo of the bridge in a minute. I guess that'll
tell them something. But not that much. Oh, this is it. This is it. This sign was in it. Yeah, wait, here,
let me pull it up. Sam. Yep. Alright, well, at least we
know we're in the right place. Alright, are these the stairs? I mean, I have to believe
that he's up the stupid stairs. We should at least
start climbing the stairs. Yeah, we should
start going up them. He'll send his picture soon. Honestly, the very
big-brain move by Ben would be to not hide.
Yeah. 'Cause this is like, you know,
immediately you think, oh, he's going to be up there. And then we walk
all the way up there, and it's like, Ben's not here. They're going up to
the temple. They're going— This is, in fact,
exactly what I predicted, is that the thing that
this place is known for... which I can say it now,
Yamadera. The thing that Yamadera
is known for is the awesome temple they have at the
top of the mountain. And it seems like
Sam and Adam went right to the base
of that big long path. Alright, let's go ahead and
send them a photo of the bridge. And that will probably narrow down their
search quite a bit. Unless they can't tell
that it's a bridge. Yeah, it's not a bad idea.
Okay, he's under the bridge. He's definitely under the bridge.
(rasps) Okay, let's go check the bridge. Okay, let's go.
There's that bridge. Yeah, that one
actually doesn't look right. It doesn't look right.
Because this is concrete. Yeah.
He's definitely at the river. Yeah, well, he
could be underneath maybe that underpass.
No, there's water. He could also be on this side. Well, let's just go
down to the bridge. I bet Adam really wants to
make the catch happen soon. Well, I want it
to either happen soon or in a really long time. But probably soon. I get to draw another card. Let's hope it's a good one. Curse of the Cairn. Curse of the Cairn. You have one attempt to stack as many rocks
on top of each other as you can in
a freestanding tower. Once your tower falls, the Seekers must
construct a rock tower of the same number of rocks
before asking another question. Okay... I mean, I do have rocks here, but not really the
kinda rocks that I need. So actually I think
what I'm gonna do is... I'm gonna discard... these two Curses because they're basically
useless at this point. And I'm just going to draw three. And my goal at this point is just to draw into as
many Time Bonuses as I can unless I can get a Curse
that I can play here. But there are sort of
limited instances of those. Okay. A randomized question. A— Ohh-ooh! A 30 minute bonus! So that's pretty good. And a 10 minute bonus, not bad.
That's exactly what I wanted to see. I don't know how useful the randomized question
thing is going to be, but... It's not going to hurt.
I might be able to use it. I'm feeling pretty good. Let's see what they're up to. We might have just
walked right over Ben. So it's not that bridge. Well, unless this side
looks different. Let's get on the bridge and then we'll be able
to see up and down. Okay. Yeah, so... Under here is brick. Yeah. So it's not that.
It's not that. It doesn't feel like it's that,
because it's like a flat wall. I mean, there's
a bridge down there. Perhaps Sam and Adam
will not fall into the same trap... as last time, but... The last time in hide-and-seek,
as you remember, I hid under a slide. In retrospect, I really
should have picked a spot that I was willing
to actually stay in for more than five minutes. And... that was
very intentional because I knew that they would
ask me to send a picture. And they'd, you know... It would be very clear
that I was under a slide. And so instead of
asking more questions and narrowing down the area, they just spent way too long trying to find this slide. Which is just a huge waste of time. But I do think that
Sam and Adam... They kinda lock in. And so if they think they
have enough to go off of, they're just gonna go off of that, and they're not gonna
ask excess questions. But honestly... They shouldn't do that.
They should just ask more questions. This is mostly a Sam thing. Adam might be arguing
with him about this. Let's just check the map
to see where all the bridges are. Just trying to see... Do we want to confirm
that he is on the river? I mean, we see water.
I guess you're right. Because we could ask a
question confirming it. What? We could compare
our distance to a river. I mean, we see water. I feel like there's
probably something. I mean, really, we just
need to go that way or we go this way. Okay.
I feel like. Which one do we
think is more likely? I slightly think this way. See, I kind of disagree. There's that highway looking thing made of concrete this way.
Okay. I feel like the thing
down there is not going to be like a road. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. They're coming my way.
No, go check other bridges. Go check other bridges.
Don't come this way. Go check the bridges
on the other side. Go— Oh, no, go away. Look, the river
gets all narrow here. It splits into two.
Like this bridge. I wonder if he's under this. No, it's the wrong material.
Uh-oh. Nope. They're going
the wrong way. They're going to check
the wrong bridge again. They're going to check
the wrong bridge again. No, yeah. I mean, it seems like
the most likely candidate is the one downstream.
Okay. And there's no other
bridges this way? Not that I can tell
within the zone. This is what I'm saying.
It's just like... I feel like it would be
easier and faster to just ask me another question. You know,
maybe I draw a good card. But probably I just draw
some dumb bull-(bleep) that's not even gonna help me. Instead, you're out here
checking all the bridges on the Tachiya River. The other side's
not the right material. That's not promising. Yeah, it's the wrong material. There's another
bridge further down. Oh, come on, Ben. This seems to be
the last option. At least the material's right. No, it's brick
again on the other end. What the (bleep) I think we just
have to keep going down. Well, no, that's too far.
That's too far? Yeah, there's definitely
not another one in this way. I think... I'm not sure we got this one.
That's just... That's on the other branch.
Oh my god. It's completely on the other end?
Yeah. That blows. I mean, do we want to... I think at this point,
we might need to ask a question. Well, here's what we can do. We could ask a half-mile
Radar from here, which would basically
include half of the area because we're on the edge.
I guess we might as well because we're not worried
about more Curses, right? Not really.
Yeah. I mean, there's not much cost. Okay. Oh, yep. And there they go.
There they go. They just asked for
a half-mile Radar. And it's like... Look, you guys. You're gonna have to ask
more questions anyway. You shouldn't have gone and
checked all those bridges. You should've just
started asking questions. Now, I get to draw
two more cards. Is there water
flowing under that? There actually is.
Okay. This seems promising. No, but very close. It's a miss anyway.
Okay, I think we got it. Radar's a miss.
It's a miss? I think we gotta head to that.
Okay. Okay, well that's not great. Yeah, I mean,
all signs point to that one bridge that we missed.
Okay. Now I get to look
at the top two cards and draw one of them. Well, there are
some Curses in here that I could get that
could be quite good. (chuckles) It's a ten minute bonus or it's Curse of
the Gambler's Feet. Curse of the Gambler's Feet. For the next hour,
Seekers must roll a die before they take any
steps in any direction. Casting cost: Roll a die. If it's an even number,
this Curse has no effect. I do have to
roll an even number in order to get to work,
but, I'm gonna try. I got my die. You know,
I'm gonna get up close. We're gonna make sure that
we can see the die here. So I'm gonna take one
of these guys, and... We need an odd number. Oh, that's a five. I am so, so sorry, Sam and Adam. This is what
I was talking about. Alright! Three. Three. Six. One. Four. Alright, well look. Sam and Adam are not moving fast,
but let me tell you, they're at least moving
the right way. Again, either way, it's gonna take them a
while to get here, so... I'm still sitting pretty. Three. This sucks. I think we wanna go this way.
One. Well, let's make sure
we go the right way. Two. Five. Four. Five. Two. As I look at the map
and I watch Sam and Adam sort of slowly limp towards me as I know that they are
literally rolling dice every time they want to take steps,
I'm reminded that... this is a lot of fun. And you can in fact make your friends do this
very same thing at home. Because you can buy, again,
you can buy this game, and you can play with your friends,
and you can make them roll dice a bunch of times
and get really mad at you. You just can't have that kind of fun
on PlayStation 5. Adam.
One. Say Jet Lag: The Game
Five. ...hide-and-seek
is a fun home game that people should want to play.
One. Look. Should we include this Curse? I ultimately do think
the Curse is fun. Yeah. Four. Five. Two. Three. Five. Two. Two. One. Five. Four. Three. Five. Five. Three. Three. One. Four. Six. Five. Four. One. Six. Four. Five. Six. One. Looking promising. Two. One. Four. Five. Four. One. One. Two.
Two. Three. Six. One. Four. I see him.
I found a small man. Hi, Ben! Should we come down
and meet you? Hello. Sorry, I know that I did
a lot of annoying things to you. You got your lemons, though. You got your lemons nicely—
Give him his souvenir. Oh yeah.
Ben, here's your souvenir. Oh boy, a rock.
Do you love it? I love it.
Whoa, that's littering. It's a rock. Okay. Aaahhh... Good bye.
Adam, good luck. Alright, where's the... Where do you think he's going? Figure it out.
That way? Alright.
This timing is not perfect. But frankly, it could be worse. Let's see what we can do. Alright. Let's see
if we can pull this off. Alright, well... It took looking until
the very last minute. But I finally found a hiding zone
that I feel good about. And I'll see you tomorrow morning
to show it to you. Good night! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Adam, where are you? Well, you know,
you'll find out soon. And you, actually,
you could find out right now if you subscribe to Nebula. Because the next episode
of Jet Lag: The Game is up right now on Nebula. You could see exactly
where I'm hiding. You could see if I get found
or how long it takes. You could learn all that
information right now by watching the next episode
right now on Nebula. Are we allowed to do that?
Lots of quality— No, we can't see. We can't know. But there's lots of quality
entertainment for you right now on Nebula,
including: We have a whole aftershow
podcast exclusive to Nebula where we talk about
the behind-the-scenes. We talk about
all kinds of strategy stuff that we don't actually have time
to talk about during the show. So if you really want to get into
the nitty-gritty of the episode, you listen to The Layover on Nebula.
The game design. We talk a lot about
how we designed the game. We talk about
what we had for dinner. Mhm. Sometimes we talk about
really stupid stuff. It's enthralling. And that's not
the only thing on Nebula. There actually are, like, way, way, way more other things. So, in addition to
there being, you know, a lot of your favorite
YouTube creators also post their stuff on Nebula, it's often extended,
or early, or ad-free, or some combination of all of this.
Well, it's always ad-free. Oh, sorry, well,
it's always ad-free. But it's also often
early and extended and sometimes a combination
of all these things. But there are also
a lot of Nebula Originals, Nebula exclusives,
things that are only on Nebula. There's actually a whole
series that we made. The Getaway, a reality series that's sort of like
The Mole or The Traitors, but we made everybody
the mole, and they didn't realize
they were all the mole. That's fun. But other people
have made things too. There are narrative films like Dracula's Ex Girlfriend
and Identiteaze and Night of the Coconut. And there are documentaries. Documentaries such as
ones that we've made, like The Colorado Problem. Boomers is a documentary that just came out,
and that's a good one. Brian McManus made a whole series, Battle of Britain.
I mean, there's a lot of stuff. I think what
we're trying to say is that there's a lot of
top-quality original content made by, you know, kinda
indie creators and stuff. And, you know, it makes sense
because turns out the creators founded Nebula. Whoa!
Whoa! We were like,
""Yo, what would it be like if we made a streaming site,

That's sort— That's the whole show. It's hide—
We're playing hide-and-seek. And so you don't know
where I am. Welcome to hide-and-seek
across Japan. Over this six-day game,
Ben, Adam and I will compete to hide as long as we can
without being found. Each round, two players
will serve as Seekers, giving the Hider
three and a half hours to hide anywhere in Japan. In order to find them, the Seekers must deduce
their location by asking questions from our new revamped
62-question menu. Truthful answers
get Hiders access to a brand new tool:
the Hider Deck... chock full of advantages
like time bonuses or Curses that can slow the Seekers down. One... two... Oops. (chuckles deviously) If this is not a good card... Are you kidding me? Been sipping sake. Ripping through

Okay, I'm calling your ass out. Stop asking smart questions. Ask stupid questions. We're goin' dark. That is nothing like

to the grand finale of our 72-hour game
of tag across Europe. Right now, it's the
morning of day 3, and the whole game has just
been turned on its head. Adam, who had been screwed
by a line closure last night and forced to head up to Nogara, was in a terrible position
going into this final day. Ben and I were able
to set ourselves up right along the path
he was taking to Padua, and we figured that
it was all but guaranteed that we were going to catch him. But at the last moment, in the station where we
were waiting for him, Adam got off of his train and
transferred onto a different train that was also going to Padua
in order to trick us down the line. Not realizing what he had done, we ended up getting
on his original train and missed our easy catch. Now we're both on separate
trains heading to Padua. Our train will get there
a few minutes earlier, giving us another chance
to try to catch him there. But to make matters
even more complicated, Adam doesn't even realize
what's happened at all. He assumed that we were all the
way back in Padua to begin with, and his whole train swap
was meant to trick us into searching
the wrong train there. So basically, this is a giant mess. Adam has no idea what's going on, we've just majorly screwed up, and we have one last
chance to catch him before we lose
all of our advantage. Got it?
Good. Here we go. (groans exhaustedly) Phew, okay. Ahh. Alright, we will be
in Padova... in about 20 minutes. So we'll see if this works. Okay. If he got on the later train... then presumably... we can get out
on the next stop. Well, the next stop is Padova. So, I mean, we can do it again, but that train does
continue to Venice. So it's going to be another
of the same situation. And the problem now is... if he got— if he gets off
in Padova, and we get on... Yeah. He actually has
options out there. Right. We should be able to...
you know... Okay. Attempt number two. Yes. Okay, welcome back. Let's see where
his train is getting in. Five. Okay. I would have had a
really good route to Austria if we had gotten that. Well, then maybe
it's good that happened. I could have
connected in Verona to a non-stop train
to Innsbruck. Well, Sam, you're never gonna
get on a train to Innsbruck if we don't catch him, so... I know. Eyes on the prize. It's tricky. I mean,
this is a busy station... with multiple exits. I think we're gonna
have a better chance if we go on different
parts of the platform. If—
Yeah, I agree. If the most important
thing is spotting Adam and seeing what he does... then we're just gonna want to
cover as much of it as we can. I agree. Okay, you go to that side,
I'll go to this side. Stay behind the vending machines. And I guess focus on... focus on... the center
of the platform. It's fine if he spots us from
the far end of the platform, because he can't get past us. But we cannot let him
get past us in the center of the platform. Alright. So if this has all worked... then they should not be here. And maybe they won't be. Do you have his location? For some reason,
I can't look at location. Oh, train's here.
Train is here. In fact, maybe
they won't be here. It would be cool if they weren't. We're gonna start by
trying for track 8. Track 8 has a train to Treviso. If it's leaving a little bit late,
we might be able to get on it. Nope, already left. Okay. Then we have to decide
if we're going to... Verona or Montebelluna. I say Verona. I know Verona's the wrong way, but it allows us to get on
that line up to Innsbruck. I felt like I got
a really good look at everyone getting off, but... Hard to know, 100%. You thought you
maybe did see him get off? No, no, no. I thought I got
a pretty good look at everyone getting off, so I— Oh yeah, I'm
pretty sure I did too. So I think if we don't see him... in the next couple minutes... we quickly get on. No, no. No, let's go to Montebelluna. Montebelluna's better. Okay. Well... Step one, I guess, worked? I don't know. I guess it depends
on where they are. The train leaves
in three minutes. I'm gonna see if I can get
a more precise location on him. No, it's still quite big. This damn tracker. Okay, well, look. We're making it past Padova. And that was the big choke point. So I actually think
that's pretty good. I don't know if we're
making it past Padova because my plan worked, or if we're making it Padova... for some other reason,
but I'm taking the win. Right, I think it's
decision time, Ben. Alright. I think
we get on that train. You ready? Go quick.
Yeah, go. Don't start
searching yet, wait. Please stand
clear of the door. Man. We missed him twice. I wonder if
he had a disguise. No! There's no way he
had a disguise again. I mean... The train did wait a little while
to leave once we got on. Maybe he was able to slip off
without us spotting him. (rasps) It's impressive moves. But I still don't think it's going
to be enough to save his run, because we're still in front of him. We're still
in front of him, but... Attempt number three. He's moving west. Okay, so he's probably
going towards Verona? Anyway, hello. Welcome back to
Venezia Mestre. I feel awesoooome. If we're going west,
we need to... We need to get
a high-speed ticket. Okay. Let's find a ticket machine. I think he's just
taken a turn north. Oh. North?
He went west of the station, but it looks like he's maybe... Okay, so that's to Treviso. Maybe? And it looks like he could
be going up to Castelfranco. Yeah, yeah, that must be
what he's doing. Castelfranco, so he's trying to— So we might want to
go up to Treviso. There is a train to
Udine leaving at 2— leaving in 2 minutes,
but that would be— No, no, that's too much. Oh, no, no, no, wait. But that stops in Treviso.
That goes through Treviso. So that is...
Platform... Platform 4, this one. Yeah, because
he's definitely— he's— He's now definitely
on that line north. So I think we definitely
want to get on this. Alright, welcome
to Castelfranco Veneto. I believe that you, the audience,
have been here a few times. But this is my first time
in Castelfranco Veneto. Now... I have a few options. I could go northwest up
to Bassano, to Trento, like Sam did yesterday,
up to Innsbruck and over. I could go to Verona
and then go up and over. Or I could do
what I did the first time, which is go to Gorizia
and then up. Or I could try to go
up through Villach. And I know it sounds great,
so many options. But actually almost all
of them are very bad. I think that it would
still be a huge mistake to go northwest. That is not really any
further in my territory. And if Sam tags me,
and he goes next, it will not be hard
at all for him to get back into his territory
anywhere up along that line. So I have to go east. In terms of going east,
there are the two options. Now... one is the thing
I did the first time: Gorizia, which is still
not a terrible option. The second one is
to go up through Villach. And let me tell you, I would
love to go up through Villach. But it's almost impossible. There is... There are two trains
today that do it. One at 10 am, one at 4 pm. They're both high-speed. And they take over three hours. Which means that they
cost over 4,000 coins. And they leave from Venice, which is... not a good
place for me to go, because I think that Ben and Sam
would be very likely to catch me. But on the other hand,
if I did get on that train, I think it would win me the game. No matter what I do,
I need more coins. Which is why it's time for me to finally complete
my joke challenge. Did you just buy a
packet of plain crackers? No, they're cheese-flavored. Oh. So Ben, it looks like,
if we want to... we can connect almost
directly to Castelfranco. The thing is,
that will be on the line that he will take, or would take, between Castelfranco
and Treviso, and it looks like it makes
all the same stops, because it stops at
Albaredo, Istrana, Paese. I think we should post up
on the line between Treviso and Castelfranco, because I think
he probably... probably is going to go
that way. If he does take that train... he'll get on in about
15 minutes after we do. So we'll have time to respond. Yup. Okay, so here's the plan. Right now, Ben and I are
transferring onto a train directly to Castelfranco Veneto,
where Adam is. The problem is,
Adam has the option of taking a train
before we get there that goes the opposite way
on the same line. We figure that he's
probably going to do that, since it leaves soon
and goes the right way. So our plan is to get off at
the stop before Castelfranco and catch him where
his train goes through there. The problem is, if Adam decides
not to get on that train, like if he decides to
stay in Castelfranco to keep doing challenges, getting off on that stop would
leave us totally stranded without anywhere to go
for at least an hour. So we're gonna have to
watch the tracker closely and make sure
we get this call right. Anyway, back to Adam,
whose fate now relies on having written a good
joke about Italy. My joke is: So I've written my joke. Now it's time for ChatGPT
to write its joke. That does not make any sense. Okay, well... This is gonna be
humiliating, if I lose to ""Why did the tomato turn red?
It saw the pasta sauce."" That will be truly devastating. It's sort of... You could make the argument that it's sort of
a brilliant anti-joke. Just a complete non-sequitur. And people may like that. That would suck. Oh, Adam just
tweeted the joke. Oh yeah? So he's doing challenges. Adam—
Do we wanna vote? Yes. Adam the comedy writer should
hopefully be able to... Okay, well I figured
out which joke is Adam's. It's number one. So, number two...
is getting my vote. It looks like he's
probably gonna win. Well...
Wanna give more space, Ben? See, this is
humiliating though, because this makes it look
like I wrote number two. Yeah, that's kind of
what you need sometimes. Jet Lag is a bit of a
game of humiliation. Alright, it's
been five minutes. It's time to check the votes. And god, am I scared. Please don't, surely. Hey! Alright! Ah. Not even close! Not even— 76 to 24%. Sort of devastating that that
even got 24%, but that's fine. Okay, 750 coins. So if I wanted to do that crazy... train option to Villach... I would need 1,700 more coins in the next, I think, 15 minutes. Let's see what we
can accomplish here. Distinguish accents. Listen to Amy's video, in which a given phrase
is read by a French person,
an Italian person, an Austrian person,
and a Swiss person. Then you must successfully
match each video with the correct country of origin. If you get any matches wrong,
this card is automatically vetoed. Uh-oh. Okay, Adam is
gonna head our way. He's gonna leave in five minutes. It looks like he's a
little outside the station. Yeah, but he could
easily get to a train within a minute or so there. Yeah. But if we get to Castelfranco,
and he's still there... Great. Yeah. Then we can just trap him. He has no other way out. Yeah. I was worried about this one. Okay! Let's find somewhere to
watch Amy's quiz, shall we? If we do this well,
and quickly, then we— This could— It could
be good, actually. Let's really lock in here. One is Italian,
one is Austrian, one is Swiss. Sorry, buddy.
That's how the jets lag. Sorry, buddy. I guess
that's how the jets lag. Sorry, buddy. I guess
that's how the jets lag. Okay, that all
sounded identical to me. I'm gonna be honest,
they sounded identical. Two, I think, is Italian. Two, she, I believe, is Italian. Sorry, buddy.
That's how the jets lag. Sorry, buddy. I guess
that's how the jets lag. Sorry, buddy. I guess
that's how the jets lag. No, no, okay, I'm switching. One is Italian. Okay, here are
your answers. Your first speaker was Rocco. He's Italian.
Yes! Your second speaker
was Martina. She's Austrian.
Damn it! And your third speaker
was Evan, and they are Swiss. So, congrats.
Or sorry, or whatever. Hope you're having fun
out there. Bye! It's fine. Sam, he's going
further from the station. Interesting. If he was going
to head this way, he would be leaving
in two minutes. That's true. I don't know. Trusting the tracker is
always a dangerous game. I know, but... I know, I agree, but... We have five minutes to decide. Well, I guess
we have 30 minutes to explore
Castelfranco Veneto. Oh, I guess it's called that because there's a castle
in the middle, maybe? Let's see, let's see
if that's the case. I mean... Seems conclusive? Yeah, that train has left, and the tracker really shows
him right out in that place. Maybe he just doesn't
have the budget? Or maybe for some reason,
he misread the maps, and he doesn't think
we can get there in time. Yeah, anyway. Hopefully this is it. Alright, I believe that we... are arriving at what
has to be the castle. The Castelfranco. That's pretty fun. Quite, quite the situation
going on up here. It's like a whole fortress. I don't have a ton of time. I have to go back to the
train station in a second. But let's see if we
can take a peek inside. Look at those clouds. Yeah, they look spooky here. Those clouds do not look good. Let's maybe not do a foot chase in the middle of the
apocalypse, please. We'll do what we gotta do. What if he... If he hits us with a... with a tracker off thing? We book it to the station. Yeah. Oh, that's true. Oh, oh. Maybe that's what he's
trying to get money for. Yeah, but still. If we don't let him
get to the station. It's not a very big station. No. Okay, he's right in
the center of the city. We just have to
make sure that we... stay closer to the station
than he is. Yeah. If he starts to
make his way back. So I think we play it. Oh, look. (giggles) Adam! No, those are mine. Oh, you left those here? Mhm. You dropped them?
I guess so. These are the ones that I did. Castelfranco's great. Alright, well... about 15 minutes left
of my veto period. At this point, I really
only see one option. Which is... I gotta run it back. I gotta go to Gorizia again. Getting to Gorizia is
pretty cheap, so I actually think I'm
gonna spend 250 coins finding out where they are. Because I think that's gonna
help inform my decision. Yeah, okay. Alright, we gotta head
back to the train station. Oh, wait,
he's moving this way. Okay, okay, okay. We might— 'cause
there's two roads back. He might come down this one, or he might come down this one. But there's not a crossover. I think we might want
to backtrack a bit. Okay, so it cuts through
to, that's— That's the other road
he could take. I don't think he will. I think he's coming this way. I think maybe, one of us
should go across the street. Just in case he's on
that side of the street. Over there? But just make—
Take a quick look this way. Make sure he's not there,
and then go that way. Pull up the tracker. Okay, I don't see him. Well, there's... cars. Okay, I'm hiding
behind the clock tower on the other side of the street. He's coming down this street. He's on the same side,
so he should pass... right by here. Oh! Gotcha! (cackles) Ahh. Flawless execution. Well, flawless execution except for all of the flaws
with our execution. Yeah. Alright. See ya, gentlemen. Damn it! Did my thing work
this morning? Did you think I was
on the other train? Did you not see us at all? No. You evaded us twice. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. Wai— You did what I did! Did I?
It was the same thing. Okay, a little bit of mic
trouble here to start my run, but now's actually
a good opportunity to talk you through
my options. Lucky for me, there's a train about to leave Castelfranco,
headed for Padua, and there's not another
train to Padua for hours. To get out of here,
Ben and Adam will likely have to take a train
to Venice instead. So I get on my train, but the good news
really stops there. I've got two routes
into my win area, and neither is great. I could go to Verona,
head up towards Innsbruck, and then try to turn west. But first off, there are
no good trains there, and second, if I were to get
caught somewhere along the way, we'd likely be in
Adam's win region, not mine. The more logical option
is to go west, but that means
going through Milan, a major choke point that's
nearly impossible to avoid. The trouble is, there are no
good trains there from Padua. In fact, given the schedules, I'd likely have to
go down to Bologna and then up to Milan, giving Ben and Adam time
to potentially cut me off. So, what to do? To be honest,
I'm really not loving my options. I think I'm gonna
hope that there's some advantageous
delayed trains... in Padova. And if not... I'm not honestly that sure. We'll see. Yeah. I'm not sure. Alright, well, now it's
all about Team Ben, I think. Team Ben, Team Ben. Yes, well, Sam is... It's still a
very real possibility that we could catch Sam
in time for you to get a win. I think I'm still in it. The problem is... He has so many coins. And there's a thunderstorm
happening now. Ominous. That is not... a good sign. (thunder rumbling)
But maybe... Okay, that's not great. We gotta get
under some shelter. We just have to hope
that this... (rain falling) causes some kind of delay. Well, not really, 'cause
he's already on a train. Well, some kind of
delay that really helps us. (rain pelting umbrella) I hope this isn't an omen. So their restart time... is 10:03. There's a 10:04 to Venice. So I have to imagine they're going to
desperately run for that. (rain pelting umbrella) There's a train
to Venice at 10:04. And we're back in 10:03? Yeah. Eh, we could try it. Alright. Alright, Ben. You ready to run for it? Yeah.
We got 20 seconds. Five, four, three, two... Go! Okay, there might be a
late train that is worth taking. I'm gonna go look. Because if not,
my options are not great. Yeah. Tickets. It's a high-speed. So I need to find
the ticket office. Well, that probably means
that's not happening. There's a wait. You can get in
through the cafe here. How do we get to it?
It's this way. Oh no, it's five minutes late,
it's five minutes late. It's five minutes late,
it's on track one. Track one. Track one's here. What's Sam up to? He should have gotten
in to Padova by now. Yep, he's in the station. Let's see where he goes. Oh, his trains
are actually pretty bad. Good. Ugh. That train leaves in less
than five minutes, I think. But the delays are
not precise, so... I don't think I will make this. And then after that, there's really not good
options for a little while. Excuse me. You know, is it
possible to buy a ticket on the late train? Yes.
To Milan? Yes.
Okay. Yeah, you have to buy... the train that's late,
you have to buy the ticket. Ah, okay.
Because I think it's... Yeah.
Okay, well, I'm on— It means we can not...
Ah, okay. I'll see if I can
do it in time, yeah. Thank you. It's the high-speed train.
Yeah. You can pay with card. Uh-huh. You can go on the desk. Oh, really? Here? Do you know if
I'll make it still? (speaking Italian to agent) Your identity card? Eight minutes. Oh wait. Identity card, passport? Oh, yeah, yeah. If he wants to go to Milan,
he'll have to wait an hour. Otherwise, he'll have
to go to Bologna. Well, then— If he goes to Bologna,
he'll have to go back up. I'm not saying
he can't get to Milan. But if he does that,
it'll be expensive, and... We can go to Milan. Okay, so we're off to Venice. We're looking at Sam's options. And we think that if he's
going the Milan route, which we think he is, he's gonna have to go all
the way down to Bologna, and then transfer, and then go
all the way back up to Milan. But when we get into Venice, we can get on a train
directly to Milan. Oh, dude. What?
We can beat him to Milan. We can beat him to Milan? Oh, man. I think somehow we can
actually beat him to Milan. Business class, sir. Alright, thank you. Okay. Oh, oh,
it might just be leaving. Did I make it? Oh, I might have made it. I think I made it. Huge. I did not think
I was making that. Oh, let's go. That is direct to Milan. Which is directly
in my direction. High-speed train. Perfect connection. I don't think that
they can even get close to arriving in Milan this early. I think we'll be
hours ahead of them. Salvation. Thank you, Trenitalia. Your delays are so much
better than Deutsche Bahn's. This is awesome. No, he couldn't be on that. Well, no? No, because he was
in Padua when we left. This train is
moving pretty fast. I like that. Well, here's
the situation for us. So, we're gonna get
into Venice pretty soon. And then, there's
a train that leaves maybe ten minutes
after we get in. Probably less than ten, because we're still
a little delayed. Yeah. And it goes
really quickly to Milan. So, if we can get on that,
we could get to Milan faster than he could get to Milan. We actually are in
a pretty good position, but it all relies on
us being on this train. So in order to get
on this really good train that goes to Verona and Milan... we need to get tickets because
it requires reservations. And that means we need
to find a ticket machine, get tickets to get on that train. I think we can do it. I think we can do it, but
those machines are slow. The machines are very bad. Alright, you got it,
you got it. Find a ticket machine. Gotta be one
down here somewhere. Yep, there's a machine there. Oh, okay.
That's not a machine! Why would they put
a big red box there? That's so misleading! Okay. Just try another machine. Continue. It leaves in one minute. Where is it? I'll find out. Insert your card. Okay. Okay. Track six.
You start running. Start running.
Okay, okay. Start running. Scusi. (bleep) Alright, let's book
on the 11:30. Damn it! We're traveling
in business class, and they give you
the little snack box. Let's do a train
snack box mukbang. They have the welcome card, and then they have
a napkin thing. Oh, and more carbohydrates.
This is great. I was hoping for more
bread-adjacent things. I have not had enough
bread-adjacent things in Italy yet. Okay... Thank you, Trenitalia. Well... Brutal. Yeah, yeah. Doesn't get
much worse than that. Well, fortunately there
was a train half an hour later. Yeah, so I guess
that would have helped. But...
I have to loosen this. But, losing a half hour
could matter. Here, let's go get
something to eat. Yeah. Here we are on
the 11:30 to Milan. We could have been
on that 11, but we missed it
by just a hair. Here we go. Off to Milan. Welcome to Milan. This is awesome. Okay, I need to look out—
look for a train out of here. I'm 99.9% sure that there is no way they
could be here by now, because I made a really
quick connection. But, I'm not that sure how close behind me
they could be. So, I need to leave as soon as possible. Welcome back to
the Ben and Adam report. He's in Milan, which... I guess what we looked
at before was wrong, because I did not think he
could get there that quickly. No, I'm not sure
what train he took. But it doesn't matter, because what matters
is that he's in Milan. Yeah, we are not
going to be in Milan ...for another hour and a half. Here's the tough truth. Here's the tough truth. I'm going to give it to you... Give it to you raw. The trains to Switzerland
are very good. Yeah, it's kind of
deeply messed up. They are really fast,
but they are, for some reason, not classified as high-speed. Which means he can pay
low-speed prices for them. Yeah, it's... (bleep)-ed up. I think with his budget, he is gonna be able to
get well into Switzerland and do that on the fastest
possible route into Switzerland. And that's... I mean, that means that we won't even have
a chance to catch him until we get to Switzerland. But surely he took—
Here's the thing though. Surely he took the
high-speed line to Milan. How else could he have
gotten there so fast? Perhaps. I mean, am I crazy? He got there so fast. You know? Maybe he burned
through more coins than we thought he did. Okay, so... That high-speed train
was costly. So I don't have... a tremendous amount
of budget left. But, I have enough for
at least this train. Alright, departure board. Venice, no. Napoli, no. Locarno. I know where Locarno is. Switzerland. We are in trouble. We have to hope... that... he doesn't go to Switzerland. Yeah. Or he has less money
than we think he does. Or there's... some... benevolent act of God. To stop him in his tracks. Yeah, I mean, we're gonna need a delay or something
at this point, man. Oh, and there it is,
right there. That's the Swiss Rail operator. This is awesome. Man, the timing on this
was just perfect. I had 15–20 minutes
between the trains. Oh, this is going great. You know, this game
is pretty fun when all the stars align
right in front of you. I like this game now. Andiamo to Switzerland. Hell yes. What's the Sam status? It's pretty bad... to be honest with you,
Benjamin. What's he doing?
Well... I believe that he is on
a train right now to Lugano. In Switzerland. Yes. That would not be good. Well, it gets much worse. Oh, okay.
Which is that... there's a train that
leaves to Lugano... two minutes before
we get to Milan. Ugh. But once we miss it,
then we have to wait an hour. Ugh. God. Yeah. That's going to put
us even further behind. We'll be two hours behind him. (groans) I mean, maybe his train
will fall into Lake Como. Lake Como is right there. Wait, are we going to see it? Nope. I promise, it's right there. It's very famous. Where's the lake? Ben... Sam has crossed the
border into Switzerland. Well, let's just see how quickly we can do
the very same thing. All we need is
a five-minute delay on that train,
and we can make it. A little five-minute delay, because
we don't need a reservation. Come on, just a little
five-minute delay as a treat. Five-minute delay as a treat? As a little treat? Well, one question is,
is it a Swiss or an Italian train? Because that could
make a difference. Yeah, I mean, those Swiss
trains are always on time. Yeah, it's a Swiss train. Okay. Look at Switzerland. It's got... mountains. Wall. Train. Alright. Come on, Ben. Look, look, it's still there. Look, look the train at 12:43. It says it's two minutes
delayed right now. It's on track six. We're getting in
three minutes late now. Yeah, it's pulling in real slow to Milan. But the train—
Track six. Track six. It's still— If it shows
on the departure board, that means there's a chance. Yeah. That's it. Track six, Ben.
Track six. Where's track six? Which one is this? This is eight. That's six. Yeah, it's... Track six is there,
but I think it's gone. No. Did it leave? Is there no train
to Switzerland? I thought it might
have been that one, but that's on track five. Track six, it's gone. Ben, it was delayed. It was delayed by two minutes, but our train was
five minutes late! Okay, come on. Is there anything? Yeah, no. There's nothing to
Switzerland... until, look.
It's so long from now that it's the last thing
on the departure board. Welcome to... Cadenazzo, I believe. Google will not tell you on this connection
to stop here. It'll tell you to go all
the way to Lugano. But I was able to figure out that the train
I want to connect to stops in this random spot too. And therefore, I spend
less time on trains, and therefore I save coins,
and I need it. I need exactly the number
of coins I have right now to get to where I want to go. We're back in Switzerland. So we're back to the
cannabis ice tea. Which I still don't
really understand. Well, do you want
to go show off Milan? Yeah. We have some time.
Let's go show you Milan while we are here for an hour, because there simply is no way to get into Switzerland
in that time. Let's go—
Let's go to the bar. There's a really good bar
in this train station. I could use a drink. Well, I tried to get one for a Choo Choo Chew
episode, but... Alas. Yes. Look at that train.
Look at that train. I recognize this train. This is the train that
you can buy risotto on. Risotto train. This is kind of
an awesome life hack. If you're ever in the
Milan train station... This place—
Visit to the side. There's this wonderful market. So, Milan might not
have a train to Switzerland for an hour for
some (bleep)-ing reason, but it did have a train to the Snack Zone. Welcome back to
The Snack Zone. Today on The Snack Zone,
we are having liquor. Cheers. I hope Sam's train blows up. See? Wasn't lying. The risotto. What? Alright. Alright, let's
go to Switzerland. (whispering)
It's not looking good. (wheezes)
It's not looking good. I'm just gonna admit that it's
not looking so good right now. Oh, it's getting cold. It is getting cold. Okay. I got no more money. I'm outta money. Okay. Shuffling the cards. One last card pull
of the game. Eat this card. Welcome to Lugano. And to you,
welcome to Lugano. God, I love Switzerland. Holy moly. Whoa! Look at this place. Ben, this shot is really pretty. So I need you to say
something funny so we can use it. I think I'm gonna lose. (mutters) Oh, it's hard. It's very... Oh! It is not tender. Wait, what was the reward? Oh, no. I ate the part of it that
says what the reward was. Ben, Sam has
stopped moving in Göschenen. Does that sound familiar? Rings a bell. Yeah, I think—
I think we might know where he's going at this point. Oh, I've gotta eat fast. I'm just gonna
(bleep) up my stomach. I'm gonna be fine.
Game's almost over. There. Done. Let's go.
Let's go. Does anyone recognize this? Come on, you must.
Come on. If he is going there, we need to get on
a train in... 13 minutes. So we should go back
to the station. Alright. Okay. Oh, it is— It's— Ohh, it's cold. Thank you. So, thank you. Ooh, that's better. One last train. This one's just for
the lols, kind of. I don't think we need it. Well, Ben... He has stopped moving. Is he where we think he is? Yep. (sighs) Guess we'll see him there. It's gonna take us
so long to get there. And Ben, it's so cold there. We gotta do what
we gotta do, Adam. We are the Chasers, and we will chase to
the very last minute. ♪ It's chilly ♪ Track 11. Almost there. Almost there. It's nice to be back. Are you excited, Ben? Because it's time to play
my favorite game. What's your
favorite game, Adam? It's called put all my
shirts on at the same time because it's so cold outside
and I didn't pack for this. I thought you were
going to say hide and seek. No. Seven, eight, nine shirts. Well, if that
doesn't keep you warm, I don't know what will. Alright, let's get ready. Okay. Well, welcome. Or should we say,
welcome back. Yes, it would seem that... at least according
to the tracker... Sam has posted up in
a familiar landmark. Familiar to those
of you who watched season 9 of
Jet Lag: The Game. If the tracker
is to be believed... Sam... is in that castle... right there. Let's go get him. There they are. Coming in hot. Well, not really actually,
but that's fine. (snickers)
I think that's Sam. There he is. Well... Let's go get him. (laughs) Do you remember
how to get up there? Okay. Alright, Sam. I think he's gonna
make us go up. We got you now. In a moment. We're gonna getcha. Almost there. I hope you're worried. (indistinct) Oh, god. One more flight of steps. Yeah. (distant bell ringing) Only one more. We got you. Hello, Ben. Hello, Adam.
You're trapped now. (wheezes)
There's no way out now. There's no way out. (exhaustedly)
I can't do it. I'm gonna get you. Tag.
Got you. Well, Ben... you've got 58 minutes to
get back to your win region. Fellas... I didn't study
math in school, but... I did the numbers and... I'm pretty sure I cannot
make it back to Italy before the end of the game, so... Sam... I believe that means
that you win. Well done, Sam.
Yaaay! You have done it. Another good round of tag. Well done. And congratulations on
your first solo Jet Lag win. Thank you.
Yes. Appreciate it. Now... Should we... turn around? Yeah, let's turn around. Now, Sam,
you might be wondering, where's the trophy? Well, don't worry. We thought of that. We've been traveling with
the trophy the whole time. Ben got some very
expensive procedures done. Yes, very experimental. Mind you, this is
very experimental. Wait, who paid for those? So fellas, back up, okay? Here... we go! I'm transforming. Whoa!
Oh my god. That's crazy! I didn't know
you could do that, Ben. Now... Sam... Ben turned into the trophy! Is this FDA approved? No! Ugh. You hold him up.
Oh yeah. Ben trophy. I'm gonna cherish this
for my... Wait, I need Ben to write videos. I can't put the trophy
on my wall if he's... Well, he can turn back. I transform back! And do you want him
to transform back now? Sure, let me just—
Can you scooch? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you can scooch. Oh, that was so painful! It crunched all my organs! You're all crunched up now! I'm all crunched up now! Sam, you've been on
so many trains. So many trains.
For so long. Crossing borders.
Oh my god. And in this moment, I guess
I really just want to know... How are you feeling? (wincing) Oh my god.
I mean, I could... I could go on and on
and think about how I'm feeling. Sure, yeah. There's a lot of things
about how I'm feeling. But I guess if I were to
try to do it succinctly, because I do think that
engagement matters. You summed it up. Yeah, if I were to sum it up, I guess I would say
I'm feeling... ...jet lagged! Whoaaa!
Yeah! Let's go!
We can't run, it's too slippery! (shrieks)
Wohohoho! Good bye!
Good bye! See you in season 12!
Aah, my organs! See you in season 12! Ben, are you okay? Yeah, I'll be fine. Alright. Alright! Okay. Here, let's set up
a nice little shot. And we both sit there,
and we face the camera. I like this shot. Alright, let's hurry up. Yeah, that's nice. Thank you so much for watching yet another season
of Jet Lag: The Game. Hopefully you found it fun? I found it fun.
I found it fun. I found it especially fun,
especially the end. But anyways, if you want
to hear more of my opinions on that ending and... your... y'all's opinions on that ending... Mhm. You should listen
to the Layover podcast. This is a podcast that we make
every single week in-season, basically acting as the companion
to the show you see here. So everything, you know,
this is highly edited down. Everything that we
can't show in the show, we talk about on The Layover. And there's a lot. There's always a lot
of strategy to explain. A lot of mistakes to explain,
a lot of BTS to talk about. And then, you know,
it's also a good way to stay in touch with the show
during the off-season. Because we sometimes
play some games, we do some BTS of
the upcoming season. More than 10,000 people
listen every week. So, you know. Pretty good numbers. But another thing to keep you
occupied during the off-season is we made a whole other show,
called The Getaway. We've talked about it
a little bit, but basically, we did this big, real reality show where we had
all these other creators, and we were driving them
across the whole American West, and they were doing
all these challenges. And they thought that there was one traitor who was
stealing from them, but it turned out that
they were all the traitor. It was really funny.
It was very experimental. It was our first time
doing anything like that. And we wouldn't have been able
to do anything remotely like that without your support on Nebula. Yeah, it's worth saying,
both The Layover and The Getaway: Nebula-exclusive, Nebula Originals.
Only on Nebula. And Nebula, sort of... A big thing that they do is, in addition to a lot of
YouTube creators that you know putting their stuff up on Nebula, often early, ad-free,
sometimes extended... is that they will give
creators a big budget to do sort of
dream projects for them that they would not be
able to do on YouTube. Our dream project was
gaslighting a bunch of our friends. That's true,
and we got to do it, and it was really fun,
and we had a whole crew. Yeah.
You know, a crew of 25, real cameras and
lighting and everything. And they've done that
for other creators. Jessie Gender created a
short film, Identiteaze, that was sort of
her dream project. Abigail Thorn from
Philosophy Tube has a short film out,
Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend, that was sort of a
dream project for her. Patrick Willems made a movie,
Night of the Coconut, sort of a dream project
for him. Tom Nicholas is making a
documentary called Boomers. And these are all, you know,
these really cool, exciting projects that are only made
possible by your support, by subscribing to Nebula. Yeah, I'm really
looking forward to Boomers, because it's about
the ""geritocracy"". Yeah. Which is a new word
that I've learned. Yeah, I think
it's the gerontocracy. Yeah, something like that.
Yeah. Yeah, anyway. But it's about why
American politics has been kind of taken over by people
who are 80-something years old. By the Boomers.
By the Boomers. Yeah.
Yeah, but it's looking good. Anyways, Nebula,
worth signing up for, IMO. So go to nebula.tv/jetlag
to sign up. Thanks for watching this season. Bye?
Bye! I love you.
See you in season 12. (shudders) Yeah. A lot of seasons. Like a dozen, wow.
I know. Jeez. Bye. Caption+ by JS*

of tag across Europe. Right now, we're nearing
the end of day two, and we've ended up right back
in the middle of the map. At the end of the last episode, we caught Ben on a train
in Ferrara, Italy. That was bad news for Adam, who had to start his run
trapped on a train heading away from his territory
and deeper into Italy. He managed to get off
that train here, in San Pietro in Casale,
having already lost some ground and a huge chunk of his
45-minute head start. Now he's on a train heading
back up towards Venice, with little budget and no plan. Ben and I, meanwhile, were forced to take the train
all the way down to Bologna, where we'll wait out the
rest of our freeze period as we figure out how
we're going to catch Adam. Hello.
Well, we're in Bologna. Yep. You did tag me, Sam,
but I made it to Bologna. I made it here. Technically, not as a Runner. Okay, well,
but I still did it, though. Adam is heading up to Venice, so as soon as we're out of
our little rest period here, we're gonna have to figure out the fastest way
up to Venice as well. I mean, I got on
this train to Venice. It's gonna use up
almost all my coins. I'll have 710 when I get there. If they make the 4:01
from Bologna, they'll get to Venice
20 minutes after me. If they don't make that train, they'll get to Venice
an hour after me. And the difference
between 20 minutes and an hour
is a big difference. I... don't know
what to do. (snickers) I feel like Adam... he's gotta try something
different this time. It's been made clear that trying to cross the Alps by going all the way east
to Trieste is tricky. Yeah. But... Well the other route would be to go up into Austria
through Innsbruck. Yeah, so basically... What you were trying to do.
What I was doing. Which, you know, if he does attempt that,
and then we catch him, it's good for you. Certainly good for me. Maybe not good for the
dynamism of this show. No. Dear passengers, we inform you that
the train has stopped due to ongoing
police investigations. They said that the train
has been stopped ...due to a police investigation. We've been stopped here
for a while. (passengers cross-talk) Should I switch gears, maybe? Alright, Ben,
we have 30 seconds. Alright. We're gonna quickly
see if we can get a ticket on the high-speed train
to Venice. But it probably won't work.
Unlikely. And if not, we're actually
getting right back on this train. Yep. Four, three, two, one. Alright, Adam,
we're coming for you. It's there.
Oh. Right, that's it?
Yeah, yeah, do it. No, it hasn't! I promise it hasn't! It's still here! No! Ben! Alright. Let's just get on the 4:10. Alright. Off to Venice. Alright, we've been
stopped here for 10 minutes. I just— I don't have time
to just sit on this train. I just— I simply don't have time. Okay. Guess we're gonna
have to switch gears. (passenger speaking Italian)
Excuse me. Oh, scusa.
Scusi. Oh, ha! Scusa. Okay, alright.
Any trains running? Is it just this train or...
what's going on? Okay. Mantova. Alright. We're going to Nogara! (sighs) Ugh, didn't have a choice.
Didn't have a choice. (sighs)
Simply didn't have a choice. Okay, it looks like
Adam's doing something weird. It looks like he
transferred in Monselice, and now he's going... Yeah, I'm trying to figure out if he's turning—
West? Good. Apparently there's
been an accident up ahead in front of Padua. So, he might not actually
be heading that way because he wants to. He might've had to. The problem is... ...we might run into
the same problem later down the line. But, if his train was
going to get delayed 55, our train is one hour behind. So by the time we get there,
it should be cleared. I mean, as long as
their delays are accurate. Which... ...don't seem to be the case. It seems to me like all of
the other routes are quite slow. And we have no idea
what he could be doing. It's really hard to plan for that. I think we'll just have to wait. If certainly if he
did not intend to do that, he is going to be panicking. Hello. A lot happening. So I... I was on my train to Venice. It got stopped due to a... ...police incident?
I don't really know. They said it was going
to be late an hour. And I mean, they were
right behind me. So I figured I couldn't
just stay there. So I just got on... ...a train. It doesn't really go
the right way, but I mean,
it puts me west enough that there's a line up to Verona. And then I can try to make
my way up to Innsbruck. I mean, I'll be honest with you.
The timing's not great. It's not great timing. I don't... really know
what to do. I'm in a bit of a pickle. So... Benjamin Doyle and I
were talking, and... we think that Adam probably... is gonna just run it back. Did I— Wait, did
I say Ben or Adam? I don't even remember. My brain's pretty (bleep)-ed. All I've eaten today is vinegar. Wait, I meant Adam. He's the Runner. 'Cause... he's gonna just go
back to Verona. Once he's over there,
he kinda can't come east without at least
coming close to Padua. And he knows, most likely, that we just followed
right behind him. Or at least he
probably suspects that. I think he almost certainly
is going through Verona, or has to go through Verona. Which, I don't think
it's a bad strategy for him to get up— to try
to get up to Innsbruck. I think the main reason
he might've been avoiding it is because it's really high-risk. Because if we catch him, that's gonna set me up quite well. Yep. So, I think he preferred
to be over there, so that he could just run
out the clock, hopefully, and make it so that I just
don't have enough time to get back into my zone. Right. But now, of course, this little delay on the train
has, I think, forced his hand. Alright, welcome to Nogara. I believe.
Let's double check that. Yeah, Nogara! Things are not great,
at the moment. In fact I would go
so far as to say that they're pretty bad. But I have a plan. Alright, Ben and Sam have
probably already explained this, but from where I am to make any meaningful progress
towards my region, I need to go either
up through Verona or over and up through Padua. They are probably in
either Padua or Verona or in between them right now, and there's a high-speed line
that goes between those cities, and I am down here on
the low-speed line. And I would have to go
over and up, and basically... ...they will just ping-pong
back and forth and block me no matter what I try to do. So the only solution is
to try to trick them. So step one is I am going to try to
post up here for a while and earn a lot of coins. And then in the morning... there's a train to Venice
where there's a little trick that I think that maybe I can pull. But either way,
we need a lot of coins, and we have very few. So it's time to pull a challenge. Burn this card. This card must be burned within
five minutes of pulling it. If you fail to burn this card
in five minutes, it is vetoed. The card does not need
to be entirely burned, but it must be on fire
at some point within the time limit. The source of the fire cannot be
something traveling with you. If you unintentionally
catch anything else on fire, the card is automatically vetoed. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no... Alright, Sam, we're
here where Adam gone off and seemingly might have
been forced off his train. Yeah, no issue so far. They haven't mentioned
any issue. Yeah, no, I think
they're gonna let us through. So we might not have to
deal with that at all. It sucks for Adam. ♪ It sucks for Adam ♪ Sorry, Adam. Adam, this one's just for you. I'm sorry. I'm not #TeamSam, like I told him. What?
I was just making that up. You lied? I'm #TeamAdam all the way. If you're watching this, but... You lying to him,
or you lying to me? No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no. Lighter, lighter, lighter, lighter. Okay, I need a general store. Shoot. This is not good. Are there any candles? This restaurant? Uggh! Is there a general store? It's too far away. Shoot. Ugggh. Might be a fire in here.
Fire, fire, fire, fire... Upon further analysis... we have now been
stopped here for... longer than
a normal station stop? Yeah. Well,
I'm trying to figure out if... No. Ahh. That explains why there's
literally no one else in the car. Yeah. Okay, well, it seems like
there is still an accident, and they are kicking
us off the train. You were looking this way. You... you're... You should have noticed that there was literally
no one in the car. Well... I don't know. I thought a lot of people
got off the train here. Now we need to figure
out what's going on. There's a lot of very confused
and upset people here. Surely my best bet
is the train station. Surely my best bet has
to be the train station and just hope that there's
some little stand there or some store, something. Excuse me, sorry,
do you have a lighter? A lighter? I have to burn this. I have to burn this. You see? Maybe... (wheezes) Grazie mille. Oh. Oh, come on. (horn honking) Yeah! Grazie mille! Grazie mille! (cackles) Ben, Adam was on this. This was his train? Yeah. See, 3:10, 3:27.
This was his train. But it's still not moving. It's haunted. So, here's the thing, Ben. Here, let's sit down. If he... If we don't move... Oh, wait, there's a train
to Mantova in six minutes. Should we follow him? Alright, let's keep going. Create a Disputation on the
Power and Efficacy of Indulgences. Write down 95 of your
opinions on paper. The average word
count of your opinions must be at least five. Each opinion must be unique and
distinct from all previous opinions. Publicly recite all opinions. (sputters) Sure. Totally. So you know,
some challenges we put on because we think
they're really clever, and we think it'll be
really interesting to see how you solve them. And other challenges
we put on because we think that they'll be really,
really annoying to do, and we think that will
be funny to watch. And this is one of
the second kind. Okay, let's find...
a pencil and paper. Uh, penna? Penna?
Penna? Can I buy it from you? Uno moment. It's yours. Uh, okay. Look, is there anyone
we could find who might know anything
about what's going on? I heard someone say
""it doesn't matter which"", which would indicate something
that felt maybe he said that... I don't know. He said Italian words
and stuff that... you know... I speak French, it's kind of... Sam, this is
not very heartening. No, it's like, it's word, but you just add a, you know,
a little Italian flair. I'm gonna go try and
find someone to talk to. I mean, there's
a conductor there. Oh, okay. But there's a lot of people. Well, let's just see if
we can glean any information. Well, I mean, if we were
to take that other train, we'd have to go this very second. But I don't think that makes sense. No, I think if we
want to catch up with him, It's in our best interest
to bank on... Yeah.
...getting to Venice. So, this is next one to Venice? Yes. And you don't— We
don't know how long the delay? Yes.
Okay. I don't know if
you know what happened. No, we didn't know. Someone has been hit
by a train. Okay. Two stations away from here. So, it's gonna—
(mutters to passenger) It happened an hour ago. And it's gonna be
a long day for it because they're gonna
arrive an ambulance. It's gonna arrive...
Oh, okay. So they have
to analyze everything. So you think a lot more?
Yeah. Okay. I mean, I don't know. She didn't seem
optimistic, but... Mm, yeah, I mean... Let's look. I mean, hopefully that
means the person's alright, if the ambulance is showing up. But...
Or they just gotta... Well...
...collect their head. Oh, everything is cancelled. Everything is cancelled
except for Mantova. Which we just missed. Ciao. Grazie, grazie. Grazie.
Grazie mille. Alright. Let's find a nice place to write down all of
our opinions, shall we? Ugh, this is so stupid. Each of the opinions
has to be different and has to have
at least five words in it. New York... ...is the world's best city. Charlotte... ...is a mid city. Los Angeles... ...is a bad city. My girlfriend... Maeve... ...is beautiful. Ben... is... (groans)
(bleep) Okay, okay, it's fine. I think we should
probably get on that train. Yeah, well let's—
We don't want to miss it. Let's be where trains are. If it moves, it moves.
If it doesn't, it doesn't. This is so reminiscent of... ...'s-Hertogenbosch. Yeah. Look, this one train
could decide the whole game, based on when it leaves. I mean, minutes matter, and we're losing
so many of them. The train has stopped due to ongoing
police investigations following an accident
involving a person. Feels like the smallest
sandwich I've ever had. Everyone should
own pickled onions. Cheetos have too much dust. New York City should
outlaw broker's fees. I don't know if you know
about broker's fees, but they're an outrage. (dog barking loudly) Public transit should be free. Jerry Seinfeld should get over ...the Pop-Tarts thing. Elon Musk has ruined Twitter. This challenge was... ...incredibly annoying. (sighs) That's 95. We have to go back to
the train station anyway to make them think that
I'm going up to Verona. So, let's go recite
our opinions there. Adam can get to Verona
at 7:50. So that's almost certainly
what he's doing. So he's probably going
to end his day in Verona. Yeah. So we just have to
figure out if there's any way we can get to Verona
before the end of the day. Seems increasingly unlikely unless this train starts
moving real, real soon. Alright. There's the stazione. Alright, now,
the challenge specifies... that I have to state
all of the opinions in public. I do not want to freak anybody out. I like the color blue. The color green is solid. New York is the world's best city. Do you have any funny... Let's play 20 questions, Sam. Let's play a fun game. 20 questions. I thought of someone. Is it a man? Yes.
Okay. According to gender binaries,
which, you know. People are allowed
to identify as a man. Well, you didn't ask.
In a gender spectrum. ...whether this person identified. I said, is— is— is they— I believe
gender is a construct. Sam, a person who
identifies as a man is a man. Would you disagree? I feel like it's more regressive Pass.
...to take this angle. That's not what I said. I said that... ...the gender spectrum
is complicated. And also gender is
a social construct. This 20 questions game
is falling apart rapidly. So, with the end
of the day approaching and still no sign of movement, things weren't looking
good for Ben and I. Meanwhile, over in Nogara, Adam had ample time
to earn some coins. The... bead is... ...not that fun. The bean is not that fun—
The beach is not that fun. Despite the pouring rain, Adam was able to finish reading
his theses to the public. Knowing he wasn't planning
on taking the train to Verona out of fear that
we were already there, he decided to pull
another challenge. This challenge forced him
to post an AMA on Twitter where he had to answer any question that anyone asked him
for the next two minutes. Crushed ice or cubed ice? Crushed ice for sure. Do I like Chappell Roan? Yes, I actually do like
Chappell Roan. How's the public transport in Italy? I think it's pretty good. How do you sleep and otherwise
take care of yourself during the game? Not enough. I would say not enough. What's the H
in your name stand for? It stands for Hamilton,
great question. Alright, well that was
not that bad. With another
750 coins in his pocket and plenty of time
left in the day, Adam decided to keep going
and pulled another challenge. This time he had to
write a joke about Italy that he would post online in
a head-to-head competition with another joke about Italy
that had been written by ChatGPT. If the audience voted
his joke funnier, he'd win the coins.
But if ChatGPT won, he'd get stuck in
a 30-minute veto period, something he really couldn't afford, as it could trap him in Nogara
tomorrow morning. Sure, whatever, I can do this. Okay. Let's think. Let's think. To make matters worse
for Adam, back in Monselice, our train had finally
started moving again. I really like it
when the trains move. You know... Trains are way less cool
when they don't move. It's one of the best things
a train can do. Well, because when
a train doesn't move, it's effectively just a building. And buildings are not as cool. With just about an hour
left in the day, we were able to make it
as far as Padua, not Verona like we had hoped. But when we got off the train, we realized that Adam hadn't
gone to Verona either. Again, because he had assumed we had made it all the way there
and were waiting for him. So instead he was still in
Nogara trying to write a joke. Mario is Italian. So we ended our day
outside of Padua Station waiting to see what move he was planning on
taking tomorrow morning. Alright, well... it has taken a
humiliatingly long time to write a joke about Italy. I think it took me
50 minutes... ...but I have done it. It also is the end of the day. So I actually
don't even have time to post it on Twitter,
but I have my joke. This— I've written it down to prove that I did write it
before the rest period. I'm not gonna try to write
the joke over the rest period. You can freeze-frame that
if you really want the proof. But for you non-freeze-framers, I will reveal what the joke is tomorrow morning at 6 am
at this very spot. Good night! Good... (clears throat) Good morning! It is 6 am. And it is the final day
of competition. Good morning from Padua. Or Padova.
Or Padova. Why do—
Here's a question I have. Why are there names in
other languages for cities? That doesn't make any sense.
It's an important question. But I think the more
important question is, there's a train to Verona
leaving in three minutes. I think at this point, we definitely need to just
wait and see what Adam does. If he was going to Verona,
he would have gone to Verona. Yeah, because let's check,
let's check what he's up to. So, I actually took
so long writing the joke that if I were to do
the challenge now and fail, I wouldn't be able to
execute on my plan. And I have enough coins
right now to execute at least on
the first part of it. So I don't want to risk that. So I'm gonna...
set that aside for now. I'm gonna keep
that challenge active, but I'm gonna finish it later. Now, I am assuming... that they are in Verona. And if I went up to Verona,
they would catch me. So, we are waiting
on a train at 6:14. So, I'm gonna go ahead
over to that platform where the train comes,
'cause it's not this one. And then I will explain
what the plan is. He's in Nogara still. I don't I think that
we want to go to Verona before we see what he does. I think I agree,
'cause I guess we're worried that he would go to... Venice. He could go to Venice,
or he could go down to Bologna. And either way, if we get
on that train to Verona, then we'll be behind him. Bologna wouldn't make a
tremendous amount of sense for him. No, I think
he's gonna come here. Well, toward, yeah,
very possibly, yeah. I think he's gonna go
towards Venice in 10 minutes. Yeah. And that's gonna pass
through here. So, as I'm sure
they've pointed out, in order for me to make basically
any progress into my region, I have to make it through
one of two choke points. I either have to go
through Verona, or I have to go through Padua. And, you know...
that's not great. So, we are gonna have
to try to trick them. So I imagine when
I head towards Venice, they will head to Padua
to cut me off. So the plan is to make
a secret transfer. There's a stop on my way
called Monselice. I'm going to get to
Monselice at 7:21. There is a train
– a different train – from Monselice to Venice
at 7:28. So the plan is... Whoop. Is that me? That's my train. Anyway, the plan is... (train brakes hiss) I am going to switch
onto a different train going up to Venice
at Monselice. And hopefully
if they're not paying super close attention
on the tracker, they'll think
I was just stopped on my train for
a little longer than usual. And then when my train
goes through Padua... they will assume I must be on it, and they'll get on it. But actually, I'll be
on a different train that's a little faster
that will pass them. And then I'll get to Venice first. And then in Venice, I have a quick
four-minute transfer where I can head towards Udine. Look, is it a great plan? Who's to say? But it is a plan, and that's... better than I had for
most of yesterday. If he comes this way,
towards us... he could get off the train here,
or he could continue. Which is to say, if we stayed here, there's a pretty good chance
we'd get switcherooed. That is true,
and we know that... it is possible for someone
to successfully switcheroo. Yes.
But, in order to do that, you need to know... you need to... Oh, you don't
need to know, Sam. Well, you don't need to know, but it's a lot easier if you do know that you do have to
evade the Chasers. I would just say, if it looks like
he's coming this way, it might be worth
trying to find a station slightly closer to him that he has less likelihood
of getting off on, so that we know with confidence
we can get on his train. That could be good, yeah. Okay, so let me explain
what's going on, because it's kinda crazy, and neither team realizes
what's about to happen. Right now, Adam is
on his way to Venice, knowing full well that we're
probably in front of him. Which we are. His plan to trick us is
to get off on a random stop – the station in Monselice – and get on a different train
that also goes to Venice. He's hoping that
this will confuse us when we try to
intercept him in Padua, and trick us into getting
on the wrong train. But at the last minute, we decided not to try to
intercept him in Padua at all. Instead, we figured
that we should go further down the line
to intercept him earlier. So now, we're also
going to Monselice. That means that both teams
are heading to the same place, and Adam is going to be attempting
his secret transfer switcheroo at a station where
we happen to be waiting. What's gonna happen? I have... no idea. Okay. Here we are. Whew! Oh boy. It's chilly, okay, let's... First things first, let's figure out
where he's getting in. Yeah. These ominous clouds are
looking rather ominous. The weather is foreboding. But it's, you know... It's setting the scene for
Adam's devastating catch. Okay, this seems to
be the train that... ...he is arriving on. Yep, that's the one. Okay.
14 minutes. Okay, we got 14 minutes
to figure out the plan. It seems to me like... the most intuitive thing
would be to... ...stay underground. Yeah, we could just pop out. Yeah.
And hop on. And just stay underground
until the train gets here. And just hop on at the last minute. So then he's trapped, and we have 20 minutes
to search the train. Right. Hold on, take this. Sam... I gotta get my stealth outfit. Is it also the
'it's kinda cold out' outfit? No, Sam. 'Cause it is kinda cold out. No. This is all about stealth. Okay. Look, I'm unrecognizable.
Wait, who are— Where'd... Where did Ben go, right? Where did Ben go? But Sam, don't worry. I'm right here. What?
Sam, don't worry. I'm right here. You just couldn't see because I'm wearing
my stealth outfit. Say something only
the real Ben would know. Bing-bong. We're gonna be selling
this stealth outfit on the Nebula store. For how much? However much a black
Uniqlo sweater costs plus like $20. Yeah, I mean, it looks
like he's almost here. (faint rumbling)
I think I hear his train. Yep. (train rumbles past) It's a single decker. Okay, that's good. Well, it's a smaller train. (train brakes hiss) ...963 off Trenitalia to... (train doors open) ...departure at 7:30
at platform 1. (sighs) Okay. Oh, he's getting off. Oh my god, what do we do? Ben, down, down, down. He'll come via here. Did he see us? I don't know. So this is Monselice. And I am getting off of this train,
which goes to Venice, and I'm getting on this train,
which also goes to Venice. If he doesn't
come down in a minute, we should go up and
get on that train. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We only have... 30 seconds. Okay Ben, up here, up here. Yeah, get on. (train doors beeping) Did he change trains, maybe? The hope is that... ...they will not realize
I have switched trains. They won't pay that
close of attention. And then when that train... goes through Padova,
they'll think I'm on it. They'll get on it. Clearing Padova for me. Where I can make a transfer. And if I get past Padova, I've
gotten past the major chokepoint. What does the tracker say? It still shows him— He must have gotten
onto the other one. He must have seen us. He must have just spotted us. Because for a few seconds,
he didn't. By the time I was running. I mean, you were in front of me, but by the time
I ran up the stairs, I don't think he had seen me. Well, there was no way
he saw me, Sam, 'cause of my stealth outfit, so... Of course, of course. Yeah, he's still... He's still in Monselice. Come on, Sam! Caption+ by JS*
Transcription: Jacob Star Wah! What happened?
Ben, what happened? He fell off the ladder.
Help... Help me. What?
Sam, help me. Well...
Oh, my ribs. We can't really—
Get the ladder. We can't really
call an ambulance until we finish the ad reads.
(coughs) Yeah, we still have
to do the ad read. We have to do that. But then we could get you
to the hospital, I think. (groans) Help me. Get the ladder off me.
Ben, tell them— Do the— Get the ladder off of me.
Look to camera. Buddy, we wanna help you. But first, you gotta look
to camera. Tell him that
the finale is up right now. The next episode's
the last one of the season. Yeah. The finale is up
right now on Nebula. The last episode,
you can watch it right now. Yeah? Oh, oh... Find out who wins?
Help me. Was that good? I think it was okay.
Can we get one more? (mumbles incoherently)
Ben, can you make sure— Can you make sure that
the camera can see you? Oh, I think his face— I think the hat's making—
Yeah. Yeah, you need to
make sure that you... Can we do just
straight down the lens?
(coughs) Yeah.
Yeah. And then, the finale
is up now on Nebula. And try to enunciate.
Be clear with your words. The finale is up
right now on Nebula. You can sign up with
nebula.tv/jetlag... code. Yeah.
That was pretty good but I think the code was
a little bit swallowed.
You forgot that percentage. Yeah, and the percentage. Ooh, I swallowed my teeth. Yeah, mention the percentage. Yeah, but the code. Yeah, if we—
I mean, maybe doing— Yeah, here. Now go.
Is that better? (gasps deeply) The finale's up
right now on Nebula. Sign up with the code 'jetlag'. 40% off.
40%... Okay, that's good. (groans) Yeah, alright.
I think we got it. Why did you put
the ladder back on? This looks painful. Ben, we're gonna go get lunch. Do you want anything? Yeah, we'll call somebody. Do you want anything?
Yeah, do you want anything? Help... me. I don't— Yeah, okay.
I don't think they have that. Help will be here in
like probably a few hours. Yeah. Thank you for the support."

to episode four of this three-day game
of tag across Europe. Last episode,
Ben and Adam caught me in the mountain town of Trento
as I was trying to get to my final location of Lyon, France. Now, it's Ben's turn
to be the Runner, as he attempts to get to his
end location of Capri, Italy or to at least stay
in his win region until the game ends. There was a fantastic train
straight to Verona that Ben was planning to take, which would have given
him a huge head start. Ben was standing right
in front of that train, but he missed it, because he
was fiddling with his backpack, and then it left. So now Ben is headed
on a much worse train to Bassano del Grappa, leaving me and Adam,
well... pretty confused. So he's going
to Bassano, which is... Where I just was. Where you just were. But there's another train
in an hour. Yeah, we can get there
in an hour. And he could've...
gotten on the other train. He could've gotten
on a cheaper train... to get to Verona... and have been
two hours ahead of us. Okay. That was not the finest start to a run that I've ever had. (sighs) A lot of my plan hinged
on going to Verona. So... Now I've gotta come up
with a new plan that... originates in
Bassano del Grappa. I don't know what
that's going to be. But we'll figure it out
as we go. And in the meantime... I hope that Sam and Adam
are confused. That does not make any sense. I have to imagine... and I really don't... I really hesitate
to say this because... You've been wrong in the past. I feel like wrong in the past, and we look like idiots
when we say this, but... I believe something must
have gone a little bit wrong for Benjamin Doyle
in the last 30 minutes. Alright. It is 10:17. Our veto period has ended. So... we know what
we're doing, right? We're just taking the exact thing
Yeah, just take the... that he took, but in an hour. Yeah, what is it, at 11:05? Yeah, I think
it's exactly at 11:05. Yeah. ...Just go explore?
I propose a little lookabout. Yeah, that would be nice. Go take a looksies.
I mean, we're in a very scenic area. This is nice. Yep. Okay, so, good news. I've figured out a plan. So... I'm going to acquire... a boat somehow. And then we're gonna
take it to the ocean. And then we're
gonna take the boat out into the ocean... where Sam and Adam
can't get me. And then I will win. Now, this plan will not work if I am not in my win area. So, that's kind of step one. And I think my best route
into my win area right now is... ...Bologna. So... I have a series of connections that should keep me
one hour ahead at all times as far as I can tell... all the way to Bologna. But I will have to make
more money during those connections. So my plan is to get
to Bassano, go from there to
Castelfranco pretty quick. Then I should have
some time there to do challenges. Then go from
Castelfranco to Padua, do more challenges, go from Padua
on the high-speed, straight to Bologna. I'll need to earn... quite a bit in order
to make that work. But if I can... I should be able to stay ahead. So it's all going to come down
to the challenges I pull... (sighs)
when I have a second. Look, Sam, it's Ben! That really looks like Ben. Aw, it's gone.
Not anymore. Ooh, look, there's a big statue! Those are always nice. You wanna go
see the big statue? No. I think it's molto bene, Sam. What is? This! Okay.
The street. Oh, that's a good piazza. Whoa! This looks like
the one at EPCOT. I can't believe
I missed that train. That's gotta be
one of the all-time Ls. It went straight to Verona. Real quick. (vocal fry) (gargles mic) The fact of the matter is, if I can pull good challenges
in Castelfranco and Padua... I will be able to
make it pretty far. And I don't think they will be able
to catch up with me unless they really
anticipate my next move. They might be able
to get ahead of me if they... are willing
to cede that... like, to cede
a bunch of ground and go straight to... Padua or something, but... We'll see. So... Counterintuitively, it looks
like it might make sense for us to wait around more. Because... if we wait around
for that next train south to Verona,
which is in an hour, rather than getting
on the direct train, just the one that Ben took
an hour later in just a few minutes... we can seemingly get
south of him. We can physically cut him off. And there are these choke points. Yeah.
Padua and Verona. He cannot get further south without going via
one of the two of them. Yeah.
And if we wait, and then transfer onto
a high-speed train— Yeah, because
there's a high speed train that goes all the way...
Yeah. Milan through to Venice,
and it stops in Verona and Padua. So we can get
to Verona or Padua either before or at least
very shortly after he could. And that's assuming
he hasn't slowed down a lot to do challenges. Which I think
he very well might. So, I feel like
it might make sense to wait around for another hour? Yeah. Okay. I'll do it. I'll wait. Okay, hello. Welcome to Bassano del Grappa. There is a train in two minutes to Castelfranco Veneto,
which is right here. So we're just gonna make
a quick transfer... and keep on going. Then we'll have a little bit
of time in Castelfranco... before our next train,
which is to Padua. That means we can
pull a challenge. If we can get to Padua... with 1,600 coins... then we can get
all the way to Bologna. Now, the problem is, they could technically
get to Padua... before me, if they went... had gone all the way
around to Verona. And I kinda doubt they did that. Sam, what's happening? Well, timing is very important
for this, because... because we have a four-minute
connection in Verona. Uh-huh. But... But where's the train, Sam? It's not here, and it's
20 seconds to 12:04. Which I don't love. And it doesn't show it as delayed, but even a couple minutes
of delay could kill us. Which was really the one big
downside about this plan, is how tight that connection was. And you know where
this train came from? Where? Germany. It's getting awfully rainy. I'd feel bad for Ben, if he... if he's gonna have to do
challenges and stuff in this. Okay... welcome to
Castelfranco Veneto. It is raining quite a bit. Okay, we are here
in Castelfranco. Team Ben, do not despair. I am about to recover this run. All we have to do is
pull a good challenge. We have about 40 minutes
before the train to Padua. So, I've got a little while
to do challenges, I think, safely. Anyway, here is our challenge. Shop like a local. Go to any cafe (or any
counter service establishment) and order something. At no point can the server
speak to you in English. If they speak to you in English, you automatically veto
this challenge. (sighs) This one is quick. But I feel like I'm looking
particularly American. So, I've gotta sort of... ...absorb... I've gotta embody...
my most European self. You know. Hit him with one of these. But it is now officially 12:04. No train. The train is
supposed to leave at 12:04. Yes. It's not even here. Yes. Well...! (sighs) And the other key is probably
a really simple order. Un caffè. Something with no... Something where they're not
gonna ask any questions... and just ring me up. Okay, here's my thinking. If I am able to just... hand them something,
and then pay for it... they probably won't need to speak. If I point at something,
or I order something, they might ask
follow-up questions, like, ""What kind?""
""Whatever, that one."" (sighs) So, I'm gonna see
if I can find a cafe that I can pick something up
and hand it to them. (softly) I have to order
something very European. So that they'll think
I'm European. Maybe some... bruschetti. And then I'll hit them
with a... 1 e 50, grazie. Pervà.
Mhm. (pay terminal beeps) Grazie.
Grazie. Oh my god.
Okay, challenge complete. Challenge complete. They did not speak
a word of English to me. And in fact, they spoke
quite a bit of Italian to me, which was scaring
the (bleep) out of me. That's earned me a cool 800. Nice, okay. I'm really hungry. Oh-kay. Okay. Boom. Challenge complete. My train's at 1:25. Which means I still safely have time
to do and veto a challenge. So, let's pull another one. This is good work so far. We're earnin'.
We're earnin'. We're movin'. Team Ben... I got you. I got you. Oh, I don't got this camera. This is gonna be
a (bleep)-ing breeze. Pickle! Quick-pickle any vegetable
using vinegar, salt, and water. Your vegetable must be split
into at least five pieces. You must put your pickles
on any food you eat today. Pickle. (huffs) Okay. I can do that. We need to find a grocery store. We need vinegar, salt... and a vegetable. And I guess something
to pickle it in. If I get this,
then I think I'll have enough to make it to Bologna. Sam, what time is it? 1:04. What time was
our train to Venice? One. Yeah. That math does not work out. No. No, yeah,
you're right, yeah. Yeah. Mmm. So, are the whole thing of that we were going to
gain this half hour by doing this... Not anymore! We're going to
blame this one on our good friends
Deutsche Bahn. Because this train
started in Germany. And is therefore a collab
between Deutsche Bahn and— Whoa, that's hilarious
that we managed to get on a Deutsche Bahn
train in Italy. Alright, so we've
missed our connection. We'll take the 1:30 to Venice. But it's too late to book
a seat reservation on it, so we have to go to the desk. Found a market. Mm-kay. Let's see. Vinegar. No vinegar, okay. Let's find another grocery store. There's one this way. Alright, let's go. Let's go. This should be easy. And if I don't manage to
figure this out in time, I'm gonna head back. I think it's more important that I take this next train
and get to Padua. Because I'll have time there... before the train to Bologna. Pickle. Pickle, pickle, pickle,
pickle, pickle. Pickle, pickle,
pickle, pickle, pickle. Pickle, pickle,
pickle, pickle, pickle. Really not moving here. 60 minutes delayed. Ah! Does that mean—
The 1:30. We're running low on time. I gotta get that vinegar! I'm thirsting for that vinegar! Aceto lì.
Aceto. Ciao.
Grazie. Okay. I got aceto, vinegar. And I bought a carrot. So all I don't have is salt. But, it doesn't say there can't be
other things in my quick pickle. And... these bruschetti
definitely have salt in them. So, you know, I can just
sort of grind them up, put them in there. Give it a little extra flavor. But first, let's get
back to the station. Because I do not want
to miss that train. The 1:30 is
60 minutes delayed? Yeah. Okay. Does that mean
we should go to Bologna? Well, just, just, just
hold on for a second. Okay, then we shouldn't...
we shouldn't get on it. We can just get on a train
straight to... Padova. Let's just do that then.
Okay. I mean, it's
a slower train, but... But it's, I mean, it's
better than an hour long delay. Or we could go down to Bologna. I mean, we could try to
cut him off in Bologna. It says it's not delayed.
Let's just get there for now and then discuss. I mean, there is a train
in 11 minutes to Bologna. I'm just saying... I think he's gonna leave
Castelfranco Veneto in nine minutes... Yeah, I mean—
Head to Padua and then he'll make
his way down to Bologna. If we get in front of him,
we could backtrack even. To like, back to Ferrara?
Yeah, to Ferrara! Or wherever. Yeah, I mean... Well, he's back at the station
in Castelfranco, so... Okay, train's here
in ten minutes. Just enough time for
a quick pickle. Got my aceto.
Got my carrot. (chomp) Yeah. (chomp chomp) Get in. (chomp chomp) (chomp) Ugh! Oh. (chomp) Oh, it's burning
my spider bites. Okay. Carrot in. Now for a little bit of...
a little bit of salt. (chomp chomp) Train's almost here. Give them a shake. Those are some authentic pickles. (gags) (retches) Okay, let's go. Bleugh. Train's almost here. He's headed to Padua. The question is just— If he's gonna get
to Padua before us... I don't... I mean, and he's
gonna get to Padua... significantly before us. Yeah, then I think we get
on that train to Bologna. Yeah, I think we need to get
on the train to Bologna to get in front of him. At least to reliably
get in front of him. Okay, let's go to Bologna. Yeah. Ugh, not ideal. No. Ugh. He's on his way to Padova. Yeah. So we're off to Padua. The good news is
we earned enough... back in Castelfranco... due to our skills... that we're... we have
enough to transfer right onto a train to Bologna. And actually, even better. There is a non-high-speed
to Bologna that doesn't run that often,
that we would be able to make. And so we'll be spending
even less to get on that one. It is possible that Sam and Adam have made it
in front of me by now. And they're already in Padua. They could have gotten there. In that case,
we're gonna have to be real sneaky when we get there. As we transfer trains. Because otherwise, we are toast. And I don't think
I'm gonna get another run. And that'll be that. We'll see. But, in the meantime... I did finally get some food. The card did stipulate that... I have to put the pickle... ...on everything that I eat today. So... I am not a cheater. But I really need the calories. (full mouth)
No, it's good, actually. It's actually really good. I'm glad that I'm doing this. Alright, great. And in fact,
welcome to Bologna. There's a train up towards Ben... ...in four minutes. Wait, do you know
what platform? Well, come on, come on. What?
Come down. What platform?! I don't know, but come down. Okay, I just
was gonna check here. Well, you're...
Venezia... Eight! I'm keeping an eye out for them. Are they here? No. They are not. And I think that means that
they are following behind me. Which I think...
was their big mistake. Now... what we have to do is we have to find
the best train to Bologna. One that we can get
on safely, but also... one that'll get us there fast. So... I don't know what
partenze means. Okay, so, there are
two trains to Bologna. There's one in ten minutes,
that's low speed. And then there's one
about 30 minutes after that, that's high speed. That'll cost me more... but it'll also get me
there at the same time while also buying me
another 30 minutes here that I could, you know,
potentially use to do challenges. So I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull
a challenge now, and then we'll have a
little bit more information to make our decision with. But I have to make
that decision quickly. Okay. I'm going to go ahead
and pull this card. Let's hope it's a good one. Desecrate ravioli. Desecrate ravioli. Acquire ravioli and Oreos. Swap the filling of at least
one raviolo and one Oreo, and eat the entirety of
both of your creations. Honestly, I'm still hungry. Oh, I guess that means we'll also
have to put the pickle on it. Mmm. Well, let's see if
maybe I can get that in before the one in eight minutes. There is a grocery right here. Oh, okay. I found the Oreos. We're gonna be able
to find a ravioli. Ravioli. And it's so affordable. Okay. Okay, so I've secured
my Oreos, my ravioli. Which means that we can
knock this challenge out pretty quickly, actually. So maybe we do just want to
get on the train right now. Sam, he's on the move. It seems like he's headed
directly towards us. He seems to be
on the ramp we're on. So I think our question is just... ...where do we get off? Because we don't want
to get off too late. But we also don't want
to get off too early and risk that he gets off
before then. Right. We get to Ferrara at... We would still be
heading to Ferrara. Yeah. So I think we are safe
to get off in Ferrara. Well, the only question is,
does he get off before that? Well, if he gets off
before then, we're still right in front of him. Yeah.
What can you do? We just go get him on
a local train later, I guess. Yeah. No, that probably makes sense. Okay, so, I made it
onto the train to Bologna. Did I think I would
make it this far? Yes. Because...
how else would I win? Now, if Sam and Adam are
where I think they are, which is just getting into Padua, then they'll be able
to get to Bologna right around the same time, maybe just a couple
minutes after me. So that would be
a little worrisome. But I've been working on a plan. I wrote down a plan. This is the plan. I'm going to go rat mode. And for those of you
unfamiliar with my game, here's the idea. Bologna's in my territory. So, as long as
I just don't get caught by the end of the game,
I'll win. I think the best way
to not get caught is to move as
unpredictably as possible. Just hop on random trains,
go random directions. Just don't leave my territory. And just don't get on
a predictable train. Because if I don't even
know where I'm going, they sure don't know
where I'm going. And then how else
are they gonna... get to where I'm going
before I get there? That's the plan. We'll see how it goes. Sam, welcome back to Ferrara, Italy.
I said it first. It's unclear exactly
when Ben will arrive here. Yeah, we need to look
at the departure board, but quite soon. His tracker is not far away at all. But his is going to be
3:05, platform three. This is not it, but... allegedly this will be
the platform. We gotta find another departure
board in case it changes. It still says platform three. Yeah. Okay.
Okay. Oh yeah. I think
he's getting in now. Oh god, oh god. So we probably
need to get out of view. 'Cause he's more... It's a busy platform. We need to be...
spotting well to figure out whether
he gets off or not. I doubt he's getting off. Probably makes more sense
for him to be going. I expect him to
continue to Bologna. Okay, wait,
I need to be recording. Because we're going
to want to split up and take the train from
both sides probably. Probably?
We should get on a call. So just, if you haven't
put it together... it's really important that if
he doesn't get off the train, that we catch it fast enough
that I can get him off the train. Because if we don't, then my run will start
while we're on the train. And that will suck.
For me. Yeah, I'm gonna run
to the back. Are you going far? Adam, you're starting
at the back? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, we're looking for... Oh, where is he? Shoot! Tag! You got him? Alright, I'm coming. Here, Sam, you can film this. I'm gonna start figuring
out what I'm gonna do. So, Ben... Do you want to
know what happened? Yes. Okay.
Yeah. Well, I was hoping... that it kind of looked like
I had a bit of a plan, but it turns out that— So the train was
delayed five minutes. And I put my bag down
to go put my stuff in, and then it left. And so that's what happened. It's like, you were
on the platform. Yeah, I was right
in front of the train. I was like, oh, it's great.
I've got five minutes. Great, I'll just
rearrange myself. And it's gone. I actually noticed
that with another— another train that I took
got undelayed. Yeah, you can't
undelay something. So we will be free
at 3:59, Ben. (bleep) Right after
we get off the train. This sucks that this
has happened to me twice. Yeah. Okay, okay, okay, okay. It's, it's fine, it's fine. And I'm not even
worried about it. Actually, it's good. I think Adam will have
about four minutes in Bologna. Ugggh! He's been making
these sounds for hours. Yeah, there was a
really great 3:11 train that would connect you
directly to a train that would take you all the way
to Innsbruck from Ferrara. Yeah, I know. Yeah.
I'm aware of that. I figured. Yeah.
Thank you, Sam. Yeah, that's something
that I actually knew already. I don't want to do
a run today, Adam. Can you please go? I don't want to have to do
two runs in one day. Just let me cook
for one second. I had a lot of plans
based on Ferrara. I had not thought through
that this might happen. I did not have plans
out of Bologna. Tough. Yes, Sam, what is it? Have you considered
getting off here? Is this a stop? This is a stop. Oh.
Why'd I say that? I thought that it
didn't stop until Bologna. I am gonna get off here,
thank you so much. So be clear, you had not
considered getting off here? To be clear, I didn't know
that the train stopped here. Okay. Alright. Bye, guys.
See you in Bratislava. Well... Welcome back, Sam. Maybe I shouldn't
have said that. I felt bad for him because
I literally don't know how he would have
gotten out of Bologna. No, I mean, at least now, he's got a shot at
getting somewhere. Hello! Okay. So we're on a train to Venice. I did not know that
this train existed. Get to Venice at 5. I guess we'll just kinda see
what we can do from there. There he goes, Ben. There he goes.
Good luck, Adam. But I am looking at
the routes and... It's not good.
It's not looking great. Caption+ by JS*
Transcription: Roger Maiz, Haley Settembre Not looking awesome. It could— It's okay. I got off the train. Yeah.
Got off the train. I'm gonna get somewhere. Yeah. You know what? It might go really good. You could find out. It might, it might. It definitely might, yeah. How would they find out? Well, they could watch
next episode right now. Whoa!
On Nebula. And then after watching
the next episode, they could listen to our exclusive
aftershow podcast, The Layover, where, you know, we break down
every single episode, and we talk about
all the stuff that went on. We talk about— We break
down curveballs like this, all of the implications, how we sort of
strategize in the moment. It's a very interesting way to delve deep into Jet Lag
if you're into that kind of thing. Yeah, especially
episodes like this where, you know,
quite a lot happens, and we're cutting it down a lot. And there's a lot more to explain. You know what else
you could do after you listen to
the Layover podcast and you watch the next
episode of Jet Lag early? You could watch The Getaway. The Getaway is
a series that we made that's only on Nebula. It's a reality competition series that is sort of like The Mole, except that we told everybody
that they were the mole. It's a lot of fun. And we shot it on
real cameras and everything. And it's pretty cool. Arguably one of the most
high-budget pranks of of all time. Sort of, that's been made. Yeah.
Pretty fun. I mean, it's more than a prank,
but fundamentally, it's just kind of gaslighting them.
Well, what's fun— What's fun is that
sort of it's a prank, but it's also a totally
functional game. And that was a big part of sort of our role in
designing it, right? Is that we were like,
we want to make something that's funny and a prank, but that fully functions as,
you know, a real competition. Yeah. I'll just add one other,
you know, quick mention. I haven't mentioned this
before, but you know, if you have someone
who you think would really enjoy
a Jet Lag-related gift, and is a big Jet Lag fan
or whatever, we do now have
gift cards to Nebula. So you can now gift
early access to Jet Lag and all this other stuff
that we've mentioned to... to a friend, to an enemy,
to a family member. To a lover.
Yeah. If you gave me one of those,
I would kiss you on the mouth. Okay, now let's put
the disclaimer here. The disclaimer says
Ben loves kissing on the mouth. No, no, it does not.
It does not say that. (laughs)
It does definitely not say that. But yeah. Are there any discounts
if they sign up? Oh yes, there is a
big discount actually. Oh my gosh! If you go to
nebula.tv/jetlag there. How's that spelled? 'jetlag'?
Yeah. J-E-T-L-A-G. Wow! It's also on screen. But anyway, that would
get you 40% off. Yeah. 40% off? Pretty good. Annual subscription. That's a great deal. Pretty good deal. And also we get a little— We get a little cut of
what you sign up with. (overlapping chatter) That is quite literally how
we pay to you know, fly to Italy, buy all the croissants
that Ben ate. Mhm.    Mhm.
Et cetera. Yep.
Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of croissants. Anyway, nebula.tv/jetlag. nebula.tv/jetlag. Bye."

to episode three of our game of tag across Europe. Right now,
I, Sam, am the Runner, and I'm trying to get
to Lyon, France before Ben and Adam
can catch me. Last episode started tough for me. I lost a ton of time failing to
complete a puzzle box challenge, leaving me low on coins
and stuck overnight in the small town of
Bassano del Grappa. But then things
started to turn around. Ben and Adam got so afraid
of me taking a route north that they preemptively
went around me to cut me off in the Alps. And then, at the start of the day, I used a double-up powerup
on my challenge, and this happened. Okay, ready? (exhales stiffly) Cursed!
Your phone is dead. For the rest of your run, you cannot use your phone
for navigation or research. You may use your phone
if a challenge specifies its use (ie. to take a photo of something) or to communicate
with the Chasers. Is it good? (gasps) Chat... ...we are s-s-so back! Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. I might have just pulled the single best card
I could pull. Because this is one of
the highest-value cards in the entire deck,
and I get... 4,000 coins. So here's the thing. This means... (sighs, blubbers) (in Italian) ...Centrale at 6:26
is arriving at platform three. You okay?
Yeah. I think I got bit by one of
them Italian spiders last night. Okay, well, you gotta,
you gotta reckon that— (in Italian) The train...
Oh my (bleep)-ing god. You gotta reckon that
Sam is feeling pretty nervous this morning. Yeah. We are so back. We are so, so back. Oh my god. That is, that is... Oh boy. Oh boy. He's gotta know that
we're right on top of him. Yeah, well, I mean, if we had taken the most
direct route to him, we would be over to him... you know, in 20 minutes.
Yeah. We obviously—
We didn't do that because we thought he was
gonna get further last night. But, he should know that he's
in pretty serious danger. I think I need to make
a really important decision... quite fast. And that is basically do I go for it
this run, or not? In the dying minutes
of the veto last night, I did a little bit of research
about this morning. Assuming they position
themselves exactly right, Ben and Adam can get here... 6:44, 6:45-ish
is the first train in. I don't feel like... I don't feel like I can
make it all the way to Lyon, while evading them,
without... train schedules
on my phone and stuff. Because the ability to
formulate a very specific plan and figure out, you know,
trains and stuff is really crucial. I think my best chance
of winning... and I really don't like this risk... is to earn some more coins... get caught here... and then get a— have a
really high coin balance and the ability to
use my phone again for my second run
and be able to just go. But the thing is... It's not a when, it's an if. Because if Ben or Adam wins, I don't get a second run. And if any of them
just take too long, and we don't have enough time,
I won't get a second run. But, it's just... I'm just not in a position
to win right now. But I can put myself in a very good position
to win later. If the stars align. Man. Okay. Okay. I think that's it.
I think that's the strategy. So, we'll— I mean,
we'll keep an eye on the tracker. But we're pretty sure we know
where he's going and... Well, he only has
one way out of there now. Yeah. I just don't think
he has any options. I think, this is the whole point.
Yeah. He's— We will
be cutting him off. We will be establishing... a choke point in the Alps. Which, once again,
is a very cool sentence. So, I think considering I'm
not worried about getting caught, I think it just makes sense for me to do another
double-up powerup. I think let's do it. Let's get another
double-up powerup, potentially stranding me here
for 90 minutes. (inhales stiffly) Okay. Cursed! Data leak! For the next two hours,
you must provide the Chasers with all the following information: purchased transport,
pulled cards, outcome of challenges,
coin balance. (squeaks) It's another curse! It's another curse!
Oh my— Things never go this way. The only downside is I do have to tell them
my coin balance. Ugh. Which I would prefer
for them not to know. Considering it's so spicy. His coin balance is 5,790?! Hold on, hold on. He just pulled
the data leak curse. We can see his coin balance. Which is... outrageously high.
Oh my god. I would like to see
the look on their faces when they hear that. And I will, because I get
to watch this show. I don't— (wheezes)
That's crazy. That is crazy. He has
a crazy number of coins. Yeah. I don't... think...
it's going to matter. I would say that
this makes me feel much better about our plan now. If he has that high of a balance, getting ahead of him
is... imperative. Yeah. Well, this also makes
me think that... the stakes of
catching him right now ...are so high.
Are very high. Yeah. Because if we
don't catch him... He probably has enough
to just go straight. My guess is that
he has looked at the fastest we could get there, which is that we would
be there basically now. And he did the double-up just to try to get coins
before we caught him. And now he has a crazy balance,
and he just pulled this curse. And that is a valuable curse. And it got doubled.
That's my guess. Yeah, I think
that he probably thinks that he's about to lose, and he's just trying
to farm coins. Yeah. But it'll be interesting to see
– when he doesn't get caught – what he then decides to do. Surely he'll just go
to Trento. Given the fact that I think
they'll be here so soon... I don't think I want to do a
double-up powerup this time. So let's just do a
plain old, vanilla card pull. You ready? Date an old thing. Find an old structure. You have one guess
to accurately predict which century it was built in. You may not use your phone
or any concrete information concerning its construction date. You must make this guess
using contextual clues. If your guess is wrong, you cannot find a reliable
date of construction, or if your building was constructed
during the 20th or 21st century, this challenge is
automatically vetoed. He's pulled date an old thing. He's still just pulling challenges. He's just... (scoffs) Hmm. Oh, date an old thing. Date an old thing. Okay, okay. This town, I looked it up
on the way here, is famous for this
old wooden bridge. And I know it's that way. Let's get on the move. This is so handy.
There's a map. You just kinda go through there. Alright, here we go. It's gotta be that bridge. A good bridge. It's a very vibey bridge. I think Ben and Adam might have
just pulled into the station, so I need to be quick. I think he still thinks
he's in trouble. Yeah. And I think, this is
actually really interesting. I think he wants
to get caught soon. Because I think he really
wants a second run. That's my guess,
is that he's like, ""Please catch me, ASAP."" Which is not what we're doing. Once he starts moving... we'll have one chance
to catch him. Mhm. If he goes for the win
on this run. Because otherwise he's just— he's really gonna be able to go
without stopping for quite a while. And so we just need
to make sure that if he does go for
the win on this run... we'll be able to cut him off. (sighs) Oh, Sam. This is a good bridge. Oh man. This looks so Italian. The water's so blue. I love this. Okay, welcome to Verona. Two teams,
both alike in dignity. In fair Verona,
where we lay our scene. Oh yeah! From ancient grudge
break to new mutiny. Where civil blood makes
civil hands unclean. Okay, so, my initial guess... just based on how old,
old things often are in towns like this in Europe... So my initial guess would be... 16th, 17th century kind of thing. But on the other hand... It is a wooden bridge. I do feel like the fact
that it's a wooden bridge does mean that
it can't be that old. From ancient grudge
break to new mutiny, where civil blood makes
civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes... a pair of lovers... Eh, I lost it. Say we're in a kind of
Romeo and Juliet situation, in that... ...I wanna poison Sam. I don't think
something in the 1700s would be... as
historically significant. I think I'm gonna go... Yeah, let's try 16th century. So meaning the 1500s. The 16th century. Hmm. That ""hmm"" is me going
to check my answer, an exception to my
no-phone curse. And discovering that while the
original bridge was built in 1569, which would make my guess right, it was completely destroyed and
rebuilt three different times, most recently in 1948. Alright, does not count since I guess the entire thing
had been destroyed at one point. So, you know, the current version – while designed in the 1500s –
was not, you know... No part of it was
built in the 1500s. Yeah. I am confused why I
haven't been caught yet. I mean... it feels like if they were here... they should have
been able to get from the station
to here by now. Because it definitely was
less than a 20 minute walk, and they've had 20 minutes. So, maybe they... psyched themselves
out yesterday and went way further
than they needed to? I don't know. Yeah, so... We made the mistake
of believing in Sam. We made what I believe
was a smart decision to go ahead of him
so we could cut him off. The thing is,
you can't cut someone off if they aren't trying
to get anywhere. We are in front of him, right? We are blocking his path forward. The problem is,
if he doesn't move... we can't go after him. Because if we go after him, then he can just go to Trento and go around, and he
would beat us there. And then he would just be
scootin' all the way to the end. That is to say,
he has two paths to get to his win location. We're showing them
on the map right now. And right now, we're in a spot where we can block either. Yeah.
So this is quite safe. But if we go after him, then it'll open up
one of those two paths. And he can slip past us. Which means, unfortunately, I think, until he moves,
we have to stay put. And I think that means that he can earn
as many coins as he wants, and we just have to wait until
he starts to go for the win. So I'm currently
having to decide whether I want to take
the train out of here north. Considering that,
for everything I can tell, Ben and Adam are not here, and therefore maybe
I can take that train, which would be awesome. So I need to get there fast if I want to take that. I think I'll make it in time. I'm almost— It's 7:15. I'm almost certain it was
a 7:20-something train. The question is... was it after 7:23 when
my veto period ends? And the other question is,
do I even want to take it? Look, Sam. Eventually you have to move. Eventually you have to move. And actually, every minute
that you don't move, you decrease your odds
of getting a second run, where you can use all of
those coins that you earned. But I have to imagine,
he's gotta— he's gonna shift gears soon. He's gonna say, ""Okay, I've got enough coins. Let's just go for the victory."" If Sam gets away, and we can't
get in front of him again, with the amount of
coins he has now... He's just gonna go
straight to Lyon. So he's really dangerous. Which means that
staying in front of him is more important than ever. Where are they? What tomfoolery have
they been up to? And how are they
not here by now? They must have just massively
psyched themselves up and thought I would
get massively ahead... went massively ahead
to try to cut me off, and are now not here, so... The train to Trento
leaves in three minutes. I think I want to take it,
because here's the thing. Trento's not a big place. I think it would
take a while for them to catch up with me there. I don't know, because I
can't research, but... if it takes a while for
them to catch up with me... I will have safe challenge time
where I can get more budget. It's now 7:23. I'm officially freed
from veto period. Are we gonna do it? We're going to make it
north of the Alps? I didn't think there was any shot. Yeah. I don't see a reason not to. Oh! Great news. It looked— It was
dicey there for a minute. But it seems he has gotten
on the train to Trento. Yep, he's on his way to Trento. Which means that
in 15 minutes, we can hop on a train to Trento
and beat him there. And at least we have
something to do now. Yeah! Let's do it. This morning I woke up thinking I was gonna get caught
in about 15 minutes. And I really don't understand why Ben and Adam
could not get there within the first hour and
25 minutes of the day. So my only thought is that
they must have been... really, really worried about how good of a run
I was gonna have and, you know,
try to go somewhere... in an anticipatory fashion. Like Verona or something,
you know? How you feeling? Annoyed. I would say annoyed by how many coins he has. Just gotta make
sure we catch him and that he doesn't go again. (wheezes) Yeah. Yup. I've been eating nothing
but those cereal bars. Yeah.
For the last two days. They're not bad. Ben, what do you
think about the Alps? Uh, I'm neutral. It's a Switzerland joke. Did that make sense? Is that a good joke?
Kind of. These are the Italian Alps,
but sure. Look at this. Oh my god. Gawr-geous. And I bet it's gonna get prettier. Okay.
(imitates swishing) Welcome to Trento. Benjamin, I'd like
to welcome you to Trento. Sam should be here
in a half an hour. We have to figure out where exactly
his train is getting in. Yeah, so we can probably
find an arrivals board. We'll have to sort of
arrange ourselves to make sure that
we can block all the exits from where he might get out. Yeah. 'Cause I do not like that
Sam is good at running now. No, that could be
a bit of a problem. My legs are completely
shot from yesterday. I do not think that I could
beat Sam in a footrace. And though I could also
normally beat Sam in a footrace, my legs are also shot. Okay, here we go. Departures and arrivals. I think it's, yeah,
it's the one from Bassano. And platform one. Great. So, looks like he'll get in
on platform one. So if he does, in fact,
get in on this platform, which seems to be right... Yeah, he's trapped. I don't... I don't see how
he could... get out of it. Our guy is trapped. I think we just post up here and wait for his arrival. Maybe it just works out.
Maybe this is it. Maybe I can... string together train routes in a region that
I've never been to before. I mean, from Trento, I'm pretty sure I need to
go to Innsbruck, Austria. I at least just need to go north. And then I need to
cross into Switzerland. Crossing Switzerland,
I think I could do. Because I've traveled
Switzerland a lot. I mean, we were just there
with hide and seek recently. I mean, I could
definitely get to Lyon once I get to Zürich. Because from Zürich,
you get to Geneva. And from Geneva,
it's just a quick train. I mean, hopefully there's
a map in the station. Yeah, I don't know. Hello! Hello. We put the camera
on a tall pole. Yep, we're doing some
awesome stuff over here. So, we believe that Sam's train which should be here fairly soon... Yeah, 20 minutes? ...will get in right here,
on this platform. And then... (whap) We got him. And then... So... I'm feeling ready. I mean, look,
if I were Sam, I think... I don't know.
I don't know what I'd do. I'd say,
""Oh no, I'm screwed ""because Ben and Adam are
so talented at Jet Lag: The Game that I simply cannot win."" Yeah, he has
so many coins, Ben. I hate how many coins he has. Well, it's not a problem because he's not going
to get a second run because I'm going to win. Sure, yes, you've
said this several times. So, we keep forgetting that.
Yeah. Bellissimo. So, I think that if we just... hide behind that pillar. Oh, and there's
even a little... They put a little bench here for in case you're trying
to trap your friend who is coming from
southern Italy. He can't exit that way.
He has to go this way. We've posted up Adam here. I'll hide right behind there. I don't think he'll
have any way out. No. It's a perfect plan. That's his train. (whispers) Signal me.
What? Signal me when he walks out. That train was scenic. Hello. Gotcha! Buongiorno. Buongiorno. Okay, I need the cards. I do need the cards quickly. Okay.
I hate to be a rush, but... to quote the great
Sam Denby, please give me the cards. Now?
Yes, thank you. Okay, okay.
Good bye. Good bye. Here we go! Alright, well, he wanted
the cards very quickly, and I think I know why,
which is that— —there is a train to Verona leaving very soon. I looked... sneakily... while we were
waiting for Sam. And I saw that it was
on platform two. Okay, Verona. The good thing about
this train to Verona is... I don't think they can get
to Verona for quite a while. I'm going to do some
quick little research. Okay. This says... that they cannot get on
a train to Verona until 12:33. That gives me
several hours to work with, and I could really
make some bank. Oh boy, this... This might be
a really good start. Okay, I believe... This is my train— wait. Oh my god! It was delayed. Oh my god. Oh god, the train...
left without me. It said it was delayed
for five minutes, but then it left on time,
and I didn't even look. Okay. Okay. That's fine. We simply won't go
on that train. We'll go to a different place. (bleep) You got his location? Um... Sam, confusing news. Yes, so you were
explaining to me when he got caught that
the reason he was running is because there was about
to be a train to Verona. Yeah, so I
had checked on this. There was a train at... (phone drops)
Whoop! There was a train
at 9:37 to Verona. Really well timed. And we wouldn't have been
able to get to Verona until two hours later. So it seemed like a total,
obvious win for him. And I assumed that was why
he wanted the cards so much. But I think he is... still in the station. Which does— would
not make any sense. It was the perfect train. It was the perfect train. It was the perfect train. And I thought it was
delayed by five minutes, because it said
delayed by five minutes. And then it left. (tsk) (microphone grinding) (mouth peels open) (faint mouth pop) Ugh. So... I don't— I'm very confused. Did his tracker update? Oh, he's still here. It doesn't show him on— Okay, theoretically, this could be really,
really good for us. But last time we thought something really—
Ben was doing something that was really,
really good for us... I've learned now... that when Ben is doing
something really weird, it's usually not good for us. On the bright side... they are not
gonna know what... ...I was thinking. That might freak 'em out
a little bit. 'Cause it's like, oh my god,
what is Ben doing? Is this all part of Ben's... plan? Ben was really confident. He insisted. He had this very specific
strategy this season. He wrote down on
a piece of paper his strategy. I did not know this.
He wouldn't let me show it. I figured out a strategy... And what is that? ...that'll win me
the game guaranteed. You know what, in fact,
I'm gonna do something cool. I'm gonna write it down,
I'm gonna show it to the camera, and then you can play this clip
when I definitely win. You can't look at this. This is my strategy
to win the game that Sam can't see
because it's so powerful. And it's definitely
going to win me the game. He has some very specific ideas
about how to win this. And I feel like this could... ...play a part in... that? What is he doing? It's mind games. Why would he take— Why would he not take
the perfect train? It's because... Now I need to figure out
a new plan. Okay, we're not too long
to the end of our jail period. So how about let's go back to— Yeah, we should go back there. We need to figure out
what he's doing. Okay. I think my best bet now is... just hop on the train
to Bassano... ...at 10:05. (huffs) The tracker shows him
live in the station. Is that him? Okay. Good bye! (sighs) Oh, man. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus So, was... Yeah, so he's getting on
a much worse train. Ben, why are you getting
on a worse train? Why didn't you get
on the good train? Doesn't seem to make
much sense. I don't wanna do
this one. But we need an answer
for the show. I don't wanna talk
about it. But why did you take— I don't wanna talk
about it. How can the audience sort of learn more about
what's going to happen now? (sighs) Look..
If the audience wanted to watch the next episode
and see what happens, they could go do that right now if they signed up for Nebula. I guess that
would provide some... Yeah, that would help. But is there a different way that they could sort of
hear you talk more about (bleep)-ing this up
really bad and kind of we could
sort of make fun of you for it and stuff?
Yeah, there is, there is. There is, in fact. They could sign up for Nebula
and go listen to our exclusive aftershow podcast,
The Layover, where we get into
the behind the scenes and all the strategy of
the games and everything. Yeah, the strategy. It's the best way to get
the Jet Lag experience. That sounds good. Seems like a good idea. I'm sure he has a lot
of strategy to explain. Yeah, no, I'd love
to hear the strategy behind why you did that, Ben. Yeah.
Yeah. Nope. Oh, he seems... Yeah, okay. Well, let's... Yeah, so, you know, another thing you
could watch on Nebula is The Getaway. The Getaway is a whole
series that we made that is only on Nebula. We worked really hard on it, and basically the premise is that we made,
like, The Traitors, but we made
everybody the traitor, but they all think that
they're the only one. Yeah, it's pretty funny. It's sort of a
pretty fun thing to do. And you know,
we're really proud of it, and... It's actually shot on
real cameras, not iPhones. It looks good and stuff. Yeah, we had... We had a whole crew.
We had gaffers Yeah, we had—
and light people. You know what a gaffer does?
You know what a key grip does? We do now, because we
had those on the set. I totally knew ahead of time.
I knew everything. Yeah, I know. You totally knew
what a key grip did. No, yeah. Yeah, what about
a best boy grip? Oh yeah, I am an expert. Helps the key grip!
Anyway! The reason why
we have that on Nebula is because Nebula
makes this whole series and catalog of original content, exclusive things called
Nebula Originals. And it's done this with
all sorts of creators that you probably already
watch or have heard of. If you go to
nebula.tv/jetlag, you'll get 40% off an
annual subscription. That's a pretty good deal,
isn't it, Ben? Yeah. That's a great deal! What do you want me to say?! It's a great deal for
that amount of content? It's unprecedented! It's—It's unprecedented. Okay. Okay, what do
you want me to say? No, that's good. No, that's a
really good point. Yeah. Ben, would it
make you feel better if they signed up, do you think? Yeah, I don't know. It'd be pretty cool
if they signed up, I think. It'd be good.
Why would it— Because we get money, right?
From their subscriptions? Yeah, we would. If they used our code, then we would get
a cut of their money. Yeah. We could make the show
more and better. Yeah, use it to make
the show and stuff. Yeah we could give him
another shot at... Yeah, you know.
We can, yeah. We can make another season
where you can do a better job. No, he did great. Yeah. Yeah.
He did great. It might not have
been manifested in, yeah, but he did great. So yeah, go to
nebula.tv/jetlag to sign up. And thanks in advance. And thanks in advance
for your support. Yeah. Do you want to say
anything, Ben? No. Oh, okay.
I think we're done."

of tag across Europe. As a quick reminder,
in this game, each of us is trying to get to
a different location in Europe. Last episode,
Adam was the Runner and tried to get to
Bratislava, Slovakia. But we managed to catch him
just over the Slovenian border. That means now it's my turn
– I'm Sam, by the way – to try to get to my location
of Lyon, France. I've got a 45-minute start before Ben and Adam can
start chasing after me. So I need to figure out a plan. We are so frickin' back. This is not how I wanted to
necessarily start my run, but I think I might have
found a really good move. I'm just not sure. I'm really just not sure. The Italian train station
is that way. The Slovenian train station
is this way. And if I'm going to
the Italian one, I really need to rush, but I... think I have
a really good move by going out of
the Slovenian one. What is his plan,
do you reckon? I've got no idea.
You think he'll go north? He could.
Into Mo— I mean, if— He could go up into Austria. If I were him, I would... maybe go north up into...
further into Slovenia and then into Austria
and then west. All I know is that his best bet is to get on the other side
of the Alps. Yeah. I can get to Austria tonight. On a route that they cannot
even come close to taking. Before the freeze period is over, there's a train to... Jesenice, I guess, and... That train... (groans) That train... Okay, come on, come on. What the (bleep)? Oh my god, these train
schedules are so unreliable. It's having a lot of
trouble loading his location. He seems to be walking. But he's not going so fast. No, he's not in a hurry,
which is sort of surprising to me. You would think he
should be in a hurry. Is there a later train
to Jesenice, or is there not? Th— There are— Different places are telling
me different train schedules. (whimpers) Oh my god,
now this third place tells me something
completely different. What the (bleep)?
What the (bleep)? (sighs, sputters) Okay, that's too risky.
Okay, that's too risky. I need to get to
the Italian station. In terms of the
other train station... What it— Let's take a look
at its departure board. Well, I'm looking
at the train schedule. Yeah. What does it say? And, so, there's a train in a half an hour to Udine. I think that he's just
gonna kind of have to come back the way that we came. Well, that seems good. Yeah, and also it's like, he's not gonna
be able to do that... for a half an hour. Back to Italy. Back to Italy. Oh, I'm already in Italy. This is great. This is great. We're doing great.
I did just waste five minutes rollicking in the
opposite direction because I thought
I had a great plan. But, that's fine. That is fine. We're doing totally fine. Everything is awesome. This is great. Definitely not stressed. Definitely not feeling
the pressure of, you know, prior seasons of Tag
and (mutters) ...Okay! Doing great.
Doing great. Doing great. Doing great. Would we be able to
make it to the train station before that train to Venice left? Well, so what time
are we back in? 3:35. Yeah, I mean
the 3:43 to Venice. There's, it's at 3:43. 3:43, and we're—
So we're not gonna make that. So I think at that point,
we have to go down to Trieste. Whoa, no. Oh, that doesn't seem good. No, it doesn't
seem good for us. We're on the bus. The bus is on its break. This is the bus to
the train station. Research time. So he actually might not be
in that bad of a position. So that would get him
to Venice at 6. How fast could we get to Venice? We go down— We go down to Monfalcone.
Monfalcone. That's what I was saying.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Down to Monfalcone
and then back up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then we're only
an hour behind him. Could be better. It could be better. And the bus is late. And I think I'm going
to miss my train. (silly grumbles) Oh... this is awesome. The train was delayed
ten minutes. We're good. Okay, so here's the thing. My train, at least theoretically, will get in at 3:52 to Udine. And the first train
that they can take will not get in 'til 5:22. So, theoretically, I will have
turned my 45-minute gap into an hour-and-a-half gap, and then get a train out of there,
somewhere west. But at least I will have confident challenge time
on the ground there, which is really important
to generating budget. Ben, he's already on a train. Yep, Sam's off. We're about to be out of
our freeze period, but that— I think that means that
he's on the train to Udine. Udine.
Oo-dee-neh. Udine, yeah. But I think he gets stuck
in Udine for a little bit. This is not great though,
because our trains, it actually turned out that
his train was very well timed. Our trains are going to
be very poorly timed. We're going to have
to end up waiting 45 minutes for our train. You know the way? I do. Okay. Let's go this way.
Alright. Let's go this way. Freeze period over. Sam, we're coming for ya. We are in fact coming for you. Welcome to Udine. They might figure out
a good plan? So here's the deal. I think I found this route... that will get me to
this small town... that they cannot get to tonight with an hour and a half
to spare. And the thing
that I like about that is that it's at the confluence
of four different rail lines. So I think tomorrow morning, hopefully, I'll be able to
choose which direction I go. And juke them out. Hopefully. I don't know. I need to do more research, but I have to get on this train
towards Treviso now if I'm going to do this,
so I think I'm going to do that. And I can do
more research on there to make sure that
this is the right move. But for now, it's sounding good. We're back in Italy. Ben-via-nuta a Italia. Short little stint in Slovenia. But I had a great time there. I made friends. I have a feeling you won't
be seeing them again, Adam. No, probably not, but... they tried their best
to help me, I think. Welcome back to
Gorizia Stazione. Yep, where
we have to figure out what train we're getting on. Probably the safest thing
is to just follow him. Yeah. So, Ben... Where is he? We will know soon... if he gets on the train
towards Venice. So we could then make
our fastest way to Venice. Which doesn't go through Udine. Yeah... yeah. I mean, if we were confident— Wait a minute. It shows—
I don't have his location as of five minutes ago,
and that's when that train left. Oh.
Yep. Yeah, he left, okay. So that means that he is
going down towards Venice. He could stop before Venice. Particularly,
he could stop in Treviso. It seems to me that Venice... is not very risky
because it— we could get to anywhere he might be going. Including Venice, which is
probably where he's going. Right. So that means... we go down to Monfalcone. And then we transfer
to Vicenza. Beautifully pronounced. (Adam claps ""Let's Go"") Welcome back to Monfalcone. Welcome. I've never been
to Monfalcone. Well, welcome for
the very first time. Did you guys
go to Monfalcone? We did.
We went to Monfalcone, and I saw a lizard. Whoa! That's awesome.
Play that footage. Wow. That was great footage
of me seeing a lizard. Okay. Is it cool here? No.
Okay. Great. Also, I made Sam eat a leaf. Play that footage of me
making Sam eat a leaf. You made him eat a leaf? Ben, your shoe's un— Why did you kill that?
Sam... I'll give you 20 coins
out of my budget to eat this leaf. (crunch) So now we are off... straight to Venice on
the high-speed line. We just gotta transfer here, and then we're going
straight there. It seems like Sam's still
on his way that direction. He is truckin' along. Every minute that he stays on this train
that he's on is good. So, now,
Ben and Adam are getting on a high-speed train to Venice, seeing that I'm still
heading in that direction. But unfortunately for them, I'm not going
all the way to Venice. In fact, I just got off
my train here, in Treviso. That's because I'm getting
on a different train, the train to Vicenza, which I'm
going to get off early again to board a train north
towards my strategic hub of Bassano del Grappa. Hopefully, all these random
transfers will throw them off, and until they can figure out
where I'm actually going – not Venice, not Vicenza, but this small town
all the way up here – they're going to be
stuck on a train going in the wrong direction. (sighs) Okay. Several updates. So, it looks like Sam
transferred in... Treviso. Yes.
Onto a train to Vicenza. Which...
Which is... I would say on its face, seems like a smart move. Smart move. He figured maybe
we're going to Venice. He's dodging us in Venice. The unfortunate thing is that the high-speed train
that we're on to Venice... continues on
straight to Vicenza. Yep. So we are now
going to get to Vicenza at 7:30. He will get to Vincenza... I think it's 6:46, but... I think he's gonna have to do
some challenges in Vincenza, which means that
we're gonna get even. And I think he's gonna
have to get lucky with them too, in order to get
outta there on time. And if there's one thing that Sam often struggles
with, it is luck. No, God hates Sam. Alright, well... Sam, we will see you
in... Vicenza. (smooches) Unless he stops somewhere else. Alright, welcome to... Castelfranco something,
I don't really know. I'm just connecting here to my final destination
for today at least. So I do have about 20 minutes, which I think is just enough
to justify a card pull. So... Let us shuffle. First challenge of
the season, let's go. Puzzle box! Amy's Puzzle Box. Complete Amy's puzzle box. Do not destroy Amy's puzzle box. Finally. Oh my god. Now that... is a great one. Because I can start it here, and if I don't complete it,
that's fine. Here it is. The puzzle box. We've been carrying this around
for like multiple seasons. So here's the thing
about Amy's puzzle box. Historically, Amy's challenges
have never been the easiest. Okay, there's a bunch
of QR codes here. The first one I went to, went to a website
that has stuff on it. The other one seemed to
just go to Rick Astley's— Rick Astley's
Never Gonna Give You Up. So yeah, okay,
the other ones are Rickroll, so I actually nailed it
the first time. Okay, so this website,
there's three tweets. There's one from me... one from Adam, one from Ben. And we have a
three-digit code here. What am I supposed to
interpret from these tweets? Maybe the time? 9:07. 4:29. And then Adam's time
is 10:12, which we can't do because... this is only three digits. 708 is the number of
views on my tweet. I don't know! Ben, I have some news. Sam—
Is it good news or bad news? I would call it bad news. Sam has stopped in... Castello di Godego. What? Sam has stopped in
Castelfranco Veneto. Okay. My guess is, he probably
wants to go... up towards Trento. Yeah, well we looked at
this option a little bit, and... you would go up from there... to Bassano del Grappa, and then up
from there to Trento, and then up through
the Alps into Austria. So what's interesting is... from our perspective... the fastest way to Trento... is not that way. The fastest way to Trento... is through Verona...
and then up. Do we think
we could beat him there? Well, we actually
couldn't continue on to Verona, because it would get in
at 8 pm. It would get in at exactly 8,
which we're not allowed to do. We could get close to Verona. No, because the
stop before is Vicenza. Oh. Okay. So that's really frustrating. I'm gonna break open the emergency snack
that they gave us. There is a button for a hint,
but if I use the hint, I only get half the value
of this challenge, which would be... not cool. Okay, what the (bleep)
else could this mean? Okay. (sighs grittily) There's just so many
different numbers on here. I'm not good at puzzles,
to be honest. (sighs) I was trying to figure out if the number of days between
the different tweets is equal or something,
but it doesn't seem to be. I think I've decided
to be lame. I don't want to waste
too much time on this. There are a lot of challenges
that can be done quickly. I'm going to take the hint. Oh my god! That's so (bleep)-ing
obvious, oh! So the second one has... ""Who won"", so one. The third one has two. Four. 'Four' an iced latte. Oh, of course,
of course, of course. I really should have gotten that. Oh god damn it, there's more? Well, there's a quarter in it. Okay, I need to go to my train. Alright, let's go to wherever
the (bleep) we're going next. I don't remember. Alright, last train of the day,
I think, pretty sure? 'Cause basically
I'm trying to do it as I'm going further than as far as I can tell
they can get tonight. Part of why I like this town is
it feels like where I would go if I'm trying to take the line that goes north of it
into the Alps to start to cross the Alps. I'm not, because unfortunately,
the schedules don't work. There's not a train for a couple
hours into the day tomorrow. I would definitely
get caught by then. But it looks like it. Looks like he's on the move. I do know
he was talking big talk about getting through the Alps. And that is way worse for me. He's probably intimidated by me because he knows that
I'm gonna win. Yeah. So I think they'll, you know, assume that they can
catch me there. Assume that I'll, you know,
just get stuck there. I think they would essentially
follow me specifically and expect to catch me there. But by juking them out,
I can force them to go there... get stuck there a little bit,
and go somewhere else. Hopefully. We'll see. We could follow him... to Bassano del Grappa. Well, in many ways, it's one of the sort of
classic tag dilemmas, which is like,
do we take the risk of... going around and trying
to get in front of him? Yeah. Or do we just
chase right after him? I don't know. I really don't know. We need to decide in the next... 28 minutes. Because that's when
we have to decide whether we're getting
off this train in Venice. If he can get to
Bassano del Grappa by 6:44... Yeah, he'll be making
really good time. Welcome to
Bassano del Grappa. And mamma mia,
it is gorgeous. Look at this, Alps! There is a train that goes
through that valley... up north. I wish I could take it. Unfortunately... it leaves too late
tomorrow morning. They'll catch me at least
an hour and a half into the game day. He gets in at 6:44, right? How far up can he get? He could get on the 7:25. So the furthest he could get
would be Primolano, Ben? If you started at 6 am
in Primolano... can you make an early train? Mmm, you can. Unfortunately, Ben,
you can make an early train. To Trento. There's a train that just
happens to start in Primolano, that runs once a day that
goes straight to Trento, fast. Oh, they heard Sam was in town. That's insane,
that that exists. Okay, things are
getting a little twisty. So let's take a minute to
clarify what's going on. Right now, I'm in
Bassano del Grappa, where I plan to do challenges
until the game day ends at 8 pm. From there,
there's a train line north, into the Alps, but I
don't plan on taking it. Instead, my hope is
to bait Ben and Adam into coming after me, which, thanks to some weird
train schedules, would cause them to get stuck
in a nearby town overnight, allowing me to juke them and take a train
west in the morning, stranding them behind me. Meanwhile, Ben and Adam
are really worried I'm gonna head north,
and have just discovered an especially good route
I could take north. I don't even know that
this route exists, but now they're
so afraid of me taking it that instead of following me, they're considering
going around me on a faster route to Trento
to cut me off. So now, back to them,
as they decide what to do. We have to decide in the next three minutes
what we're doing. (sighs) I think we have to... I think we have to go around. I think we don't have a choice. Yeah, we're going around. And it means he's gonna
get up into the Alps. But I think we can catch
him there, at least. (sighs) I just think we
don't have a choice. We can't follow after him. I think we'll just
lose too much time, especially in the morning. We'll end up almost
two hours behind him if we try to follow him.
Yeah. For now, we gotta lock in ...and finish this challenge. Alright, this is the part
that I already completed back wherever the (bleep)
I was, I don't remember. Oh, that's looking good. Oh, that's looking good. Ooh. (gasps) Yes, yes, yes, yes. And then... And then... Oh my god, don't let this... Is this a red herring piece? I think it's a red herring. I know, Amy, she would. Let's flip that. Hmm. It's concerning that these
numbers are sideways. Upon further analysis,
the numbers are sideways because the puzzle is wrong. He is... playing pretty well. Given the hand he was dealt. This is our last chance.
This is Venice. I think we have to stay on. Yeah, we're going around, okay. It's not what I want. I just don't think we
have a choice, frankly. What the hell? Oh, great.
(chuckles) Okay. Okay, let's try these ones and
assume that's a red herring. No, that's not right. Okay, okay, okay. What else could be wrong? There's also this quarter. I have no idea why
there's a quarter. What if I take this number
and quarter it? No. Of course not. I'm an idiot. I don't know
why I'm an idiot yet. What does the quarter mean? It says bing-bong. Why does it say bing-bong? Bing-bong. Oh my god. (sighs heavily) It was bing-bong. You'll find your challenge
where you find... What? Okay, so this is basically
translating to ""pickled plum"". Which is a thing that
Scotty and I tried in Japan. But I don't know... how I'm supposed to
continue the puzzle box. Because... The website doesn't
have anything more. Ummm... What's the status, Adam? Well, Ben, he doesn't
seem to be getting on the train we thought
he would get on. No, it seems like he
might be ending the day... in Bassano del Grappa,
which is... not as far as we thought
he was gonna get. No, and if that is, in fact,
where he's ending the day... it means we have made
a mistake. Yeah, it means that we... we simply did not
have to go this hard. We may have gone
a little too hard. I mean, maybe
that train's delayed, but he's not even
at the station though. God damn it, Sam. This is really bad. This is really bad. I can't even figure out
how I could progress. Because I've solved this. There's nowhere to...
input information. Fundamentally, I just don't— I just don't know
how to continue. 'Cause I've scanned
all these QR codes. This string, I don't know
what the string is about. I've solved the puzzle. The number doesn't
seem to do anything. This doesn't do this.
This doesn't do that. I don't know where
to input anything. I kind of feel like
I might just have to veto. But then I barely have a
viable next option at that point. Unless they've really
catastrophically messed up. I want to decide now so that my veto period doesn't
last until the morning at 7:29. (sighs) And it's 30 minutes. I think I have been stumped. So, with
three seconds to spare... I'm gonna veto. I just... I just don't know
how to continue. It's probably gonna be
something stupid obvious. This is really bad. This is really bad. This is gonna dramatically
influence my ability to even come close
to winning this. (grumbles) Alright, well,
welcome to Vicenza. Yeah, what can I say, really? We got scared.
We got scared. Okay, one second.
I'm trying to see... if we can do
any backtracking tonight. We could get to here. But that doesn't really—
That's the wrong way. (video call dial) Oh, hey. Hello. Well, I was gonna
say I'm sorry, but I'm mostly not. I'm sorry that
bad luck has befallen you, but I'm very excited that
the puzzle box got used. Okay. Here's the solution. Did you put
the puzzle together? Yeah.
The jigsaw? Yeah. Okay, okay,
what did you... What did you get
from that experience? Numbers. Okay. Have you noticed
anything about... what you could do
with the numbers? Mmm. Let me see if
I flip them over. Well, no, clearly,
but, you know. (both laugh)
Well, sure. No. What would you usually do if confronted with
a set of three numbers, then three numbers,
then four numbers? Then four numbers? Yeah, there's
ten puzzle pieces. So it turned out
the 10th puzzle piece was... in my pocket. See, when I left
Castelfranco mid-solve, I stuffed everything
into my pocket, and when I took out
the puzzle pieces in Bassano, I accidentally left one
in my pocket. Whoops. Once I found
the 10th puzzle piece, Amy told me it was
a phone number, so I gave it a call, and it said: Welcome to the
Jet Lag: The Game Helpline. Proudly offering assistance
to weary travelers since 2023. Please listen to
our menu for options. To hear about my day,
press 1. To hear from a local,
press 2. To hear the puzzle box
challenge, press 3. I tried each of the options... I had a
pretty good day actually. Here's Evan
from Switzerland. I'm sorry, there are
no puzzle box challenges available at this time. And when that
got me nowhere, I called Real Amy again, and she told me that,
like the website said, the phone menu is seasonal. So I'd have to enter
the Jet Lag season where I ate those plum things,
which was season six. So I called Robot Amy again,
dialed six, and got this. Yeah, you got me. There's always a puzzle box
challenge available. And here it is: Blow on the coin and say, ""I wish, I wish,
with all my socks, to get coins from
the puzzle box."" Then throw it into water. Once the coin lands in water, your wish is granted and
the challenge is complete. But I'd already vetoed,
so I didn't do any of that. That really, really,
really, really sucks. Both for my prospects
of winning, but also just... I feel quite bad because
that was all in my control. You know, it feels— It doesn't feel as bad
when you fail because of a train delay
or a cancellation or just good strategy
by the other guys. That was just straight up
just me failing that. Ugh. Just tiny things like that, literally that one puzzle
piece in my pocket, might have cost me the game. (grumbles softly) At least Ben and Adam
haven't caught me yet. Got that going for me. Welcome... ...to Vicenza. Benvenuti a Vicenza! Yeah, a little bit of a curveball. Sam had basically... a god-tier route to Trento. Yeah. If he had just gone a little bit
into the Alps tonight, he would be able to get to Trento
an hour earlier tomorrow morning. More than an hour earlier.
An hour twenty earlier. We honestly don't know
why he didn't. Yeah, it's hard to say. In our opinion,
he played himself. But either way, it means that if we
continue on to Trento – which is our plan to cut him off – we'll now get there
before he gets there. For sure before he gets there,
which could be good. Alternative option,
we could backtrack and just go to where he is now,
Bassano del Grappa. Because the first train
to Trento from there is at 7:25, and we could get there at 7:20. And we would be able
to get him, assuming... Assuming no delays.
...no delays. Which does not seem like
a good thing to assume necessarily.
I was on a delayed train today! Yeah, we were on quite a few. I'm gonna sleep on it. Yeah, we'll sleep on it.
We'll sleep on it. And we'll see you
at 6 am tomorrow morning in this exact same spot. Good night! Alright. It's finally the rest period. I'm gonna lock in this
as my end location. And... See you tomorrow. Hopefully that goes
better than today. Now it's the end of day one, and time for the first
rest period. Every day at 8 pm, players stop wherever they are,
go to a hotel to sleep, and resume gameplay
from that exact location at 6 am the next morning. And now, day two. Good morning. Good morning. Welcome back to Vicenza. So... we've had
some time to ruminate. Here is my take. Give me your take, Adam. I have... I think that I... Alright, it's 6 am. Oh man, we're back. Alright, obviously,
last night didn't go amazing. But I'm back with a new strategy. Because here's the thing. All I need is to have
the spirit of a champion. That's right,
with a can-do attitude and a little bit of gumption,
I can... I can achieve any— Okay, we're gonna
gamble, basically. So far, it seems like
about one in three trains that we have experienced
in Italy gets delayed. Yes. Which means... if we were to go
to Bassano del Grappa... I would say there's about
a one in three chance that we are there... five minutes later than
it's scheduled to get in. And then we miss Sam. I think it's too risky. I think we gotta go to Trento and try and
cut him off in the Alps. Which also is a cool sentence. It's a fun sentence to say. I just think it's like, look... We could have a two-thirds
chance of catching him at 7:20, or we could have seemingly
about a 100% chance of catching him at 9:30
when he gets there. And I would rather
the 100% chance. Yeah. And when we say 100%
on Jet Lag, we mean 85.
Yeah. But that means we should go. Yeah. We increased the cost of the double-up
powerup this time, where, you know, you get twice
the value of the challenge. But this time, instead of
2x the veto penalty, we get 3x. And also just,
the challenges are harder, as you saw last night. You can reasonably fail some. But, the thing is, I think I'm gonna get caught
pretty soon, regardless, if I don't get more budget,
because I'm pretty low. So I feel like I might as well. Bit of a Hail Mary, but... Let's buy the
double-up powerup and pull another challenge. If this is good... ...we've got this. Okay, ready? (exhales stiffly) Is it good? (gasps) Chat... ...we are s-s-so back! Caption+ by JS*
Transcription: Jacob Star It's clear
that it's very good. Pretty good.
Do you want... Do you want to tell them
what the card was? No, they have to go
watch the next episode. Where?
Nebula. What? Every episode is available
one week early on Nebula. That's awesome news! So you can either celebrate whatever just happened with me or get really frustrated because you're rooting
for my downfall. I know I am. That is... right. So anyway, you should go
to Nebula and watch that. And, you know, once you're
done watching that... I think there's some other
stuff you could check out. That's so true. There is other stuff
that you could check out. You could, for example,
check out The Getaway, which is an entire series
that we made that is exclusive to Nebula. Mhm.
Which is basically... a version of The Mole,
but we made everybody the mole. I heard it's pretty good. And they all think that
they're the only one. And it sort of
takes place on a bus going through the American West,
and it's a lot of fun. And if you're done watching that... you could also
listen to The Layover, which is our
Nebula-exclusive podcast where we recap every
episode of Jet Lag, and we sort of give you some
extra behind-the-scenes, and we give you, you know, extra strategy details that
didn't make it into the cut. And we just sort of joke around and have an
all-around good time. But listen up, buckaroos.
That's not all. It's not just our stuff on Nebula. There is a massive catalog
of great content from other creators
that you know and love. We got RealLifeLore on there. We got Real Engineering
on there. We got Jessie Gender on there, [who] just put out an amazing
short film called Identiteaze. We've got Abigail Thorn,
the creator of Philosophy Tube, who just released a trailer
for an amazing new movie called Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend. And, you know, these are—
This is just another one of the many Nebula Originals
that we're able to make thanks to all the Nebula
subscribers' subscription fees. You know, we take these creators and help fund these
big dream projects, such as, you know, this really well-produced thing and three white boys running
around Italy with iPhones. That's my dream. Or our show
where we tricked people in the Midwe— in the West,
in the American West. That was my other dream.
That's true, that was, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, you should sign up. And I'll—I'll mention
a little secret. Whoa!
nebula.tv/jetlag. Whoa! It's this very, very secret link. Whoa.
We keep it very under wraps. And because on there... you can get 40% off an
annual subscription. Whoa.
Oh my gosh. We're going to lose
so much money on that. You better not type that
into your browser. That would be so bad. I would be so annoyed if you
put that in your browser. I would be so pissed if
you used our discount code. Man. Especially if
a ton of people did it. If so many people did it,
that would be so bad for us. That would be really bad.
We'd be screwed. We'd have to make
more shows. Yeah.
Yeah. Ugh, okay. Anyway, go to

(bell ringing) We're gonna play a 72-hour
game of tag across Europe. But that bell means it's 6 am, and Adam's the Runner. So he's gotta go, go, go! Bye, Adam! Bye, Adam!
Bye! See you in a few hours! See you guys in Slovakia! Slovakia.
Doubtful. Yeah, I don't think he's
gonna make it to Slovakia. Well, okay,
we have 45 minutes now. So maybe we should
go sit down and do some oppo research? Yeah, let's walk over that way and explain how this game works. Alright, so
here's what's going on. We're in the small town
of Ferrara, Italy, because it's the
approximate midpoint between these three locations. In this game, I'm trying to
get here, to Lyon, France, Ben's trying to get here,
to Capri, Italy, and Adam, who just took off, is trying to get here,
to Bratislava, Slovakia. Right now, Adam's the Runner. While you're the Runner, you can make progress
towards your end location, and if you make it
all the way there, you win the game immediately. But while you're the Runner, the other two players
will be the Chasers, who have a tracker
on you at all times and will work tirelessly to
hunt you down and tag you. Once they do, positions rotate. One of the Chasers
becomes the Runner, and you become the Chaser. If no player reaches
their end location in the next 72 hours, then the winner will be determined
by whoever's end location is closest to the current Runner
at the end of the game, which you can see in
these win areas here. Anyway, enough talk. As the first Runner, Adam's got a
45-minute head start, so now he's gotta figure out
how he's gonna make it to Bratislava without getting caught. Step one... gotta get on a train
out of Ferrara. There are really kinda
two main routes that I could take to Slovakia, because I have to go
through the Alps, so there's limited crossings. One is sort of directly north.
It goes through Innsbruck. And the other one is
more northeast. I like the northeast one because it moves me further away from both of their territories. To that end... I was looking at
the train schedules. And there's a train
to Venice at 6:15. Which is a little bit tight, but... I think that I can make that. Ben, what's that? Pigeons. No, the building. Oh. It's a castle. (sighs) Where do you think
he's gonna go, Sam? Let's take a look at what
trains there are this morning and figure out what
he might be doing. Yeah, let's see if he's
getting on that, you know, non-stop Ferrari Italy
Slovakia morning departure. Oh god, I really hope
that doesn't exist. There's a lot of options,
to be honest. And a bunch directly to Venice, which directly the
direction he wants to go. That's not good. There's a train at 6:43. That's a Venice one, yeah. I mean, there's also
a Venice one in eight minutes, and he's pretty close
to the station. He is quite quick. Look at that. Made it to the train
station at 6:09. Not even close! Not even a problem. Venezia, track four. Alright. A—Andio a Venice, maybe? We're going to Venice. Oh, he's moving. He's going on the line
to Venice. I mean, the good thing
about that, at least, Ben, is that the trains to Venice seem to be pretty high
frequency from here. Yeah, let's see when
we could take a train. Uh-huh. Alright, so right about now... they are probably realizing that the way the train
schedules work out, the fastest they could
possibly get to Venice is an hour after me, and probably is actually
an hour ten minutes after me, unless they make
this really tight train. Which means that magically,
my 45-minute lead has turned into an hour lead. And that's fun. It seems like
we might not be able to take a train until 7:43. Is that right? Oh, what? Hold on. Ah, yeah, that's not great. If that's really true,
that'll give him a big head start. (hums faux-Italian music) (beatboxes to rhythm) (continues humming) Okay, so we are almost
out of our freeze period. The next train towards Venice leaves in what, nine minutes? Yeah, and the station's
a 20-minute walk away. We'll see what we can do. Make sure your backpack's
in sport mode. I can tell.
I'm locked in. Three, two, one... Go, go.
Alright, let's go. Adam, we're coming for you. Watch out for the cobbles. The cobbles are
my greatest weakness. (sighs) Alright. It's 6:45, which means
they are off. So let's hope that
they are running slowly. I don't know if we're
going to make that train, Sam. Yeah. Alright, we've decided
with our good friends math and science
and extrapolation that we are not making that train. We tried. But there is another train at 7:43 which only gets in
ten minutes later because it goes much faster. But still, it's a win for Adam. But, here's the thing. You need to pay attention
to the coin balance. The coin balance,
especially this early, arguably matters more. Yeah. Alright, so, here is the thing
that makes this game tricky. It's not as simple as me just getting on a bunch
of trains to Bratislava. That would actually be
relatively easy. Because I'm the Runner, I have to pay for all of
my transit using coins. Okay, so,
here's how this works. While you're the Runner,
you have to pay for any form of transportation
you take, whether it's a train, a bus,
a bike, or a plane, with coins. One minute of
low-speed rail is 10 coins, one minute of high-speed rail
is 25 coins, and so on. Each player starts the game
with 2,000 coins, but that's not going
to get you very far. So, if you want to earn
more coins, you have to pull a challenge card
from the challenge deck. Complete it successfully,
and you'll get the reward. But if you fail or
choose to veto it, you'll be forced to go on foot
for the next 30 minutes. So this train is
actually pretty long. It's 114 minutes, which means
that it costs 1,140 coins. Which means when I get to Venice,
I'm only going to have 860, which is... not a ton. So when I get to Venice,
I'm gonna need to do a challenge. At that point, I should be at least an hour ahead of them. So hopefully I should
have enough time. Egghh. We're at the train station. I wanted a little iced coffee. But in this country,
that is illegal. If you put ice in coffee here,
they'll kill you. Will they let me put ice
in coffee in Austria? I guess I hope Adam doesn't
get all the way to Austria. That would be pretty bad. Our train to Venice leaves in,
what, about 20 minutes. (sighs) This train is carrying
a bunch of circles. Well, they need
circles all over Europe. Right. Alright, Adam. Time's up. We're on our way. Okay. Welcome to Venice Mestre, which does not have canals. That's that way. Sorry about that. So as far as I can tell,
the soonest they could get here is about an hour. It seems like the best move is to head towards Udine. There's a train there
in 17 minutes. But I need more coins, so... it's time to pull
the first challenge. Alright, well, Sam, it looks like he's
gotten off in Mestre. Which is very disappointing, because that means that Adam
is miles away from Venice. It'll look nothing like Venice. Yeah. He's got
a little over an hour. So at this point, he's probably
about to pull a challenge. And we just have to hope
that it's a bad one. Guesstimate a kilometer. Starting from the place
where you were when you pulled this card,
without measuring, get as close to one kilometer
away as you can, measured as the crow flies. You must be right within 30%. If you fail, you may not reattempt. Apart from a timer/watch, you may not consult your phone,
maps, or any other tools until completing or
vetoing this challenge. Okay. Okay. Okay. Metric system.
What is a kilometer? Theoretically, if I walk
at 15-minute mile pace... it should take me nine minutes
to walk a kilometer. It looks like we've got
a bit of a delay here. That seems to be
a particular feature of the Italian trains. Yeah. Look.
They said five minutes. Yeah, and they're
always 100% right when it comes to delays on
their first guess, right? Yeah. Okay, so Adam's
microphone got disconnected for a few minutes here,
but basically, after walking in
as straight of a line as he could for nine minutes, he stopped, declared his spot, went to measure
his distance, and, well... I'll let his reaction
speak for itself. Now with
1,000 shiny new coins, he headed back to the station, hoping to make the train to Udine
that was leaving in 8 minutes. Sam, it looks like
Adam is going back to the train station already. I mean, there is a train
to Udine in four minutes. Which is exactly the direction
he wants to go, so... And how would he have
gotten all those coins already? Yeah, especially
because that train to Udine is a super...
makes all the stops. It takes two hours to get there. Ah, he might have
gotten really lucky. That would be bad. Yeah. He's on the move. Towards where? Probably Udine, but we will see. Alright, Benjamin, we're
getting close to bad Venice. (sighs) Yeah. So, we were supposed
to be there now, but the train's delayed.
Yeah. But there is a train
that leaves for Udine very soon after
we're gonna get in. Yeah. I think we can make it? And I think we should. Because it's a bit of
a choke point. Yeah, I mean he's, unless
he goes all the way back, he's gonna have to go
through there to get into Austria. I think we're alright. I think we're doing
pretty good, Sam. Ben, we have a problem. Slight problem. Well, the train that
we want to take to Udine requires seat reservations,
and it's too close to departure to actually reserve
them online right now. We can try and book those
seat reservations in person. We can try.
We just won't have long. No. If we miss that one,
the next one's not until 10:08. That's not great. That is really not great. Literally the
last clip we filmed, I was like, ""I'm feeling good."" That's why we don't do that.
That's why we don't do that. We never do that.
We never say that on this show. Let's get by the door. Oh, god. And we have
no idea how to use these. No.
Let's hope. Trenitalia ticket
machine speedrun. Okay. Udine. Continue. A mobile phone?
Oh my god. Print, print, print,
print, print, print. Faster, print. Oh, please, god. We literally have 60 seconds.
Okay, go, go, go, go. Oh, my god! Six!
Sam! Was it six? No, I think it's twelve. Twelve. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Don't tell me. Oh no. Oh no, Ben. Oh no. (train accelerates)
(Ben and Sam pant exhaustedly) So, Ben and I missed
the train to Udine. And that's where things in
this game got a little messy. You see, on his way to Udine, Adam was getting so paranoid
that we had made that train and were gonna cut him off
down the line, that he decided
to get off his train in a small town in
the middle of nowhere called Susegana. I'm really hoping
that around now, Ben and Sam are sort of
squinting at the map, going, ""Where is he? Susegana?"" Suse... Susegana.
Susegana. So, Ben and I, seeing that
Adam had gotten off his train, looked at our options
to Susegana. As far as we could tell, our next train there
would actually get in before he could take a train out,
leading us to believe... Hooh. We might have him trapped. So, we booked
tickets to Susegana, knowing he couldn't
escape by train before we arrived. But Adam, it turned out, wasn't planning on taking
a train out of Susegana at all. He had cooked up a different idea. Hello, welcome to Susegana. You might be wondering, Adam, why are you
in Susegana? And let me tell you. So the train schedules
were terrible for me. If I had gone all the way to Udine, they would have just
caught up to me and tagged me before
I could do anything. So, the plan is to get on a bus... to a place called Conegliano... and hopefully fake them out. And then in Conegliano, I can get on a train
to Gorizia... which is on the border
with Slovenia. And if I walk across that border, I can get on the
Slovenian train network. And then I can start to
head up to Bratislava. I have some time here
until the bus I want to get on. The bus leaves at 10:07. So, I figure I should
do a challenge. Technically,
I have enough coins to get to Gorisia,
but just barely. And I really don't ever want to be
at a super low coin balance. So I think now is the time
to do a challenge. Alright. Play local spirit pong. Find any alcohol produced
in your current country. Throw any item from
a distance of at least six feet. You have ten attempts. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Oh man, I really hope
Susegana has stores! Okay. Okay, okay. Bar alla Stazione. Ciao. Do you speak English? It's okay. One second. (Adam and waitress laugh) Aperol, yes. That's it. Alright, well, this worked out well. I've got a cup of Aperol. Aperol is made in Italy. And let's throw
a little gummy into it. I feel like I can do this. Let's see how I do. Alright, ten attempts. Terrible. Okay. Nope, I'm overshooting it. (sighs heavily) Awful. Okay. We gotta reset. Gotta reset here. I mean, look, if he
racks up some coins, that's great for his next run. But at the very least,
we can stop him now. Yeah. And he probably knows that. Yeah, which I don't like. No, I don't like—
It feels devious. Do you want to
go look at bad Venice? Let's go look at bad Venice. I think there are
canals and stuff. Well, don't overpromise. I'm gonna be honest, Ben. The vibes here are...
not quite Venice level. We're trying to— I'm Googling cool things
that we could show you. Are you having any success? Well, no, Google's just like, ""Well, you could go to Venice."" Yeah. No. Let's get some food. Abort? Let's get some food. Let's try this. Terrible. This is not going well! Oh, that was close! Naaah! (grunts angrily) Okay, okay. That's not great. (sighs) Well, that's tough. Okay, I failed that challenge, which puts me in an
automatic veto period. Veto periods last 30 minutes. And during them, you can't take
any form of transit, and you also can't
do any challenges. Failed at 9:34. So that means my veto
will end at 10:04. (sighs)
That is just enough time for me to still make
my bus, but... (sighs) Not ideal. Not ideal! Okay, well,
I'm looking at the map. It looks like Adam is
still stuck in Susegana. But meanwhile, we're stuck in the Snack Zone. We got some Italian
exclusive McDonald's items. We're gonna be trying
the parmesan snack, which... They literally
just will sell you a tiny, tiny brick of parmesan. This is awesome. That's it. I love cheese. Alright, that
looks like my guy. If we get on the bus, then
that's step one of the plan. There are many other steps... But this is one of them. Grazie. Alright, look. Step one of the plan,
we're on the bus. Now all we have to do
is get to Conegliano, and then somehow
not get caught for another 30 minutes. And then... get on our train. And that should be easy, right? I'm gonna get off a stop early. Just so that I'm a sitting duck for as little time as possible. I would say we're... we're for sure entering
the danger zone. There can be no doubt
about this. I'm almost certain
that they're here. I have to imagine... that they are here. Okay, interesting update. It looks like Adam has
made it to Conegliano. Ungh, okay, wait. Bit of a headache, but I still think we
might have him trapped. But it might mean we
want to get a different... tr–aawwwh. (sputters) Let's see. We just missed
a faster train to ""Coneglione"". Well, let's see what
his routes out of there are. 'Cause they're still... quite bad. I mean... We can go to
Trieste pretty soon. Well, not that soon, but... Half an hour to go to Trieste. I mean, actually,
that's his only route. Yeah. Because everything else
is to Venice. Everything else
is just backwards. Okay, so... (laughs) We do have a faster route
to Trieste getting in... Ugh. I wish we didn't. Yeah, 'cause now
we have to decide. Ugh, I hate decisions.
Okay, so... Oh, and we only have
five minutes. Okay, okay.
Okay, okay. Paraphrasing,
paraphrasing, paraphrasing. If we left right now, we would
get to Trieste beforehand, even if he took that train. However... If we went to Conegliano now, and he went on that route,
anywhere on that route... as best I can tell... which is not great right now... our next version of
that same route... is not until two hours later. So we would not get
into Trieste until 3. That would be really bad. Yeah. If we went to Conegliano, and he did get on
that train to Trieste— He would be able
to get out of there. We'd give him
two hours in Trieste, which is a big station with
cross-border opportunities. And then he'd be
well into Austria. I think we need
to go to Trieste. Christ, okay. So, okay, we have
one minute to decide. Our train is about
to arrive right here. I'm not feeling it. No? I think... I just don't see why he
would've gone to Conegliano if he was just planning
on staying there. I have dark visions of us getting on this train
and getting stuck. Yes. Oh, man! This is the part of the game
where you start to get so paranoid. You hear any sound, anything. (sighs)
And it really seems like... ...it's them. And look, even if they
are at the station, maybe I can sneak past them. You never know. It's possible. I mean, it would— Ben's done crazier stuff than that. So we're just tracking
Adam's movements. He's not fully at
the station back. He seems to be heading back,
but he's cutting it awfully close. Real close. I mean, if he doesn't make
this train to Trieste, he's stuck there until 1 pm. I'm a little more
than a five-minute run from the train station. I'm gonna hang out here until about five minutes
before the train leaves, because maybe that'll bait them into coming up here
to come after me. And then... I'll just run to the train. And maybe
they'll have come up here. And I can outrun them and
get on the train, maybe. I believe he's gonna
make this train to Trieste. Yeah, I have to imagine. Because nothing else
makes sense for him. But he's only got
a couple of minutes, and he's not even
at the station yet. (clock bell ringing) (sighs)
I think we have to go for it. Alright, I'm gonna run. Just... 'cause maybe that'll make me... harder to catch. I don't see them. Now our biggest risk is
that they're on this train, which is extremely possible. I don't see them.
I don't see them. I don't see anybody. Okay. I'm buying the ticket. Oh my god. I think we might have done it! So he must be
taking that train. Well then, we are going to
be taking this train to Trieste, basically parallel with him. Yeah, but on a different line. On a different line.
But then— So we have to
get in front of him and then double back
and cut him off. Yeah. We might both
end up in Trieste, but if he ends up somewhere
before Trieste, then... Yeah, I think it
would be weird for him to go all the way to Trieste. Yeah. And I'd be surprised
if he had the budget. (in Italian) The regional train
coming from Bassano del Grappa Yeah. and headed to
Venezia Santa Lucia Il treno... is here. is arriving on platform 11
at 10:52. Let's go. Alright. We are finally on
a moving train again. Well, that feels good, I guess. We're on the train to Gorizia. I didn't totally expect to
get on the train to Gorizia. I kind of thought they
were gonna get me. So obviously
the biggest risk now is that they are waiting for me
later on this line. They certainly would've had time to get ahead of me at this point. But I mean, look. This is good. There can be no doubt
that this is good. There can be no doubt at all that what's happening now
is quite good. I'm just doing a little bit
of research about if there's any faster route to somewhere that
he stops on the way, like Gorizia. Yeah, the one interesting
thing about Gorizia is there's not
a train connection... across the border, but... You could walk that. Yeah. Into this Slovenian line. So, I do wonder
if he's going to Gorizia. I would prefer
he did not do that. Ugh. I don't like that. I feel like anytime
there's a move that I'm like, ""Oh man, I really hope
Adam doesn't do that""... Adam does that. Alright. I did not really expect that we would get
all the way here. So... We are in Gorizia. Which conveniently
is a two-mile walk from the border with Slovenia, where there is a town
called Nova Gorica. The plan is... we're gonna walk into Slovenia... where we can join the
Slovenian train network. Now... there isn't a train
for a while, so... we're just gonna
have to hope that... they don't show up
before it gets here. We also don't have
enough coins for that train. So we are gonna need
to do a challenge. And I figure,
might as well pull it now, while we're walking. Alright, here we go. Get lucky on coin flips. Get a coin to land heads up
seven times in a row. Get lucky on coin flips. Get a coin to land heads up
seven times in a row. Alright. Let's flip heads
seven times in a row. This side is heads. Heads, one. Two, alright. Three, whoa! Four, nope, okay. Alright, well— Welcome to Monfalcone. It looks a tiny bit
like he's gotten off. Okay. So he is— He's going for
the Slovenia border gambit. Or he's just
checking out Gorizia. Or he's just
checking out Gorizia. Either way, that means that
we're headed to Gorizia. Nope. Nope. Nope. This sucks. Nope. (coin drops)
(bleep) Yeah, this is gonna
take a while. So our train... ugh, still not for a little while. Still not for 38 minutes. We're gonna go
check out Monfalcone. Yeah, let's go see
the wonderful... town of Monfalcone. Okay. There's some good vibes so far. This looks like
an industrious town. Oh, wow. That's a lot of industry. Mhm. And right over that way
is Slovenia. Which I hope we don't
get to see up close. It's actually in almost exactly
the opposite direction, but... Oh. There's a lizard, though. Slovenia's that way. No. No. One. Two, alright. Three, okay! Four! Alright. Once again, we have
not yet gotten to five. This would be five. This could be
a good milestone. Five! Five, okay. We can do this. Alright, I'm gonna
stop walking so I can put
all my focus into this. Alright, this would be six. Whoa, oh my god,
that's six. Folks, we're at six. Alright. We got a 50-50 shot of
completing this right here. (exhales) Come on. Vending machine on two. Oh, there's a vending machine? Yeah.
Wait, I wanna make a meme. It's— You— The meme is: ""Me"", and then ""winning Jet Lag"". We're gonna label it. You mean getting
very, very close... but not quite there? No, no, you don't get it. Nope. Nope. Nope. No. This is just gonna be such an
unbelievable nightmare to edit. Just, just horrendous to edit. That's the other
terrible part of this, is that I'm doing this,
and it sucks, and I know that I'm gonna
have to edit this later. (softly) No. Oh my god. One. Two. Three. Four, alright. Five, okay. This is for six. We have six. That's six. Okay. Nobody panic. Nobody panic.
We're gonna set up a shot. Okay. Here we go. Come on. Okeh! It's better to give him hope and then crush it. Because truly, the name of
this game is not winning. It's just trying to... create emotional turmoil
for Adam Chase. Mhm, mhm. Yeah, I mean... Basically anything
we do does that. It's not that hard. One. Two. Nope! Alright, I'm really, really
starting to feel like I might need to give up. (sighs) Oh my god. Look, look around. Look around... at how pretty it is. And I'm... And I'm doing this. I've been looking
just at a coin. (sighs heavily) Alright. Back to it. Nope. How's it looking, Sam? Getting pretty close
to Slovenia, Ben. So, we did say that we really
can't let him leave Italy. But what we really meant by that was we really can't
let him leave more than a couple miles over
the border outside of Italy. He can have a little
bit of Slovenia as a treat. Just a treat, yeah. Have fun with that, Adam.
Let us know how Slovenia is. Or you'll be able to tell us soon,
because we'll be there. Yep. See you soon. Okay. No. No. No. No. One. One. One. Nope. One. No. No. No. No. No. No. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Come on. Six. Okay. I've decided that
this is make or break. We are at six. If this is heads, we win. If this is tails,
I am vetoing. This is the third time
we have gotten to six. Alright, yep. Veto. Veto it. You have got to be
kidding me. He's going towards a river. Maybe he's realized
that he's trapped, and he's just going to throw
himself into the river. To have fun? Well, I don't know
how we're gonna get him. Where the (bleep) is he going? Here's what I don't like. We've reached
the part in the game where we're far enough
from when I last saw them, that I just straight up
have no idea where they are. They could be
hours away from me, or they could be legit
around the corner. Okay, well, we've
made it to Gorizia, where Adam... currently is.
We're here, Adam. Now the question just is, how do we get to Adam all the way on the
other side of town and tag him without
him getting away? Bus. Do you have him
on the tracker? Yeah.
Okay. Nova Gorica is
the Slovenian town. Which means...
when we cross this sign... I will finally be able to say... Dobrodošli v Sloveniji. That took much longer
than I hoped. But in the good news bucket, our veto period is almost up. So I'm going to head
a little more into town, in case it is a timed challenge. Just so I'm near
more shops and stuff. I mean, it literally looks like he's just walking
as deep into Slovenia as he can now.
Yeah. Alright, veto period is up. Let's do a challenge. Build a spaghetti tower. Using only spaghetti
and one other food, construct a freestanding tower that reaches at least
two feet in height and stays at that height
for at least ten seconds. The majority of the tower's
height must be spaghetti. You must declare
an attempt at completion. If you fail three times, you automatically veto
the challenge. That seems doable. Just gotta find a grocery store. Google Maps
does not seem to have... amazing data about
what's in Slovenia. But... it says there's a
grocery store over here. I mean, this looks like
a grocery store to me. They're gonna have
spaghetti here. Let's get the thickest
spaghetti we can. Yeah, spaghetti no. 7. Now we have to decide
what other food we want to build our tower with. So I think the way to think
of this is like... K'nex. You ever play with K'nex? The spaghetti is gonna be
the long, skinny pieces. And then we just
kinda need something to attach all the joints. Like a cheese ball. Cheese ball would be good. It's very light. Do they have cheese balls? These are the types of questions
I never thought I would ask myself. Do they have cheese balls
in Slovenia? You know? Yeah. Okay, potato chips here. Oh, yeah, these'll work. These corn flips. (whispering)
Where are they? Seriously, where are they? Alright, Benjamin. We're on the hunt. So, he's still pretty far. So I don't think we need
to worry too much yet. Yeah, I think
we're good for now. But I think we want
to stay on this side, because he's on this side. So it'll restrict
our sightline more. Yeah, keep the tracker on him. And just, I mean, oh boy. It's really a straight shot down. (laughs nervously) Here, get on—
I don't think he could see us. I mean... ...now, but... He seems to be a little bit
dipped back from the road... but it is truly about
as straight as a— Are you showing that?
Yeah. It is about as straight
as a road can be. You should zoom in
if you're in line. Slightly problematic
that he could just... look down this way
and see us. Mi scusi. Do you need any company? Sure, you want to
help me build this tower? Here, you want to be on? Right here, right here? Anywhere, what's your name? My name is Teo. Teo, good to meet you. What's your name?
Do you want to be on the show? Yeah, okay. Great, here. I think I have to do it, but you can hang out
with me if you want. Alright. So I have to build two feet.
Two feet. Okay, I'll be right back. Great.
Just five minutes. You do whatever
you want to do. Yeah. Stay there for a minute. We do not want him to
spot us before we spot him. That could turn this into a
long and unpleasant afternoon. Just, just go stealthy mode. It's all a mindset, Sam. (twang) Okay. That was... not very stealthy.
That was a little... Oh no, my shirt. I like this shirt. It's devastating.
Wait, is that him? I just saw a figure up ahead. Okay, just keep an eye
on the tracker. I don't see him. No, what does it
look like on the tracker? He's right up there,
but I think he must be in... some sort of park or
front yard or something. I hope he's not in
someone's front yard. Let's go up there
behind that truck. I think we can cut
through here. Are you co-streamers
with the other guy? No. Yeah, yeah,
you have his logo, yeah. Oh yeah. I saw him, I saw him.
He's down there. Oh yeah, he's that way.
Yeah, I know, I know, I heard. I talked to him a little bit. Oh yeah?
He was in the store screaming... ""I'm searching for cheese balls."" Cheese balls, okay,
that's good to know. (laughs) He's searching
for cheese balls. Yes, we are streamers. Adam was looking
for cheese balls. Why would he be looking
for cheese balls? Cheese balls. What challenge is
that a part of? This is two feet. Hey, you gotta go! What?
I saw your friends. Really?
Yeah. Shoot.
I saw the two guys. Ooh, (bleep) me. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Okay, this is my attempt. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Okay. They were that way? Yeah, yeah. We can go
to the train station. Okay, okay. Need to find a trash can.
I got it. Trash can's... is that, yeah. Great. What time is it? Okay, he's moved. I think we can go— I think
we can go down that way. He's definitely down that way now. Yeah. I think he's
going for the station. Maybe, but... we'd be able to catch up to him
and get to the station. He's on this road, right? Look, they were
right over here, on this crosswalk.
They were there? Yeah.
Okay. I really, really, really hope that Slovenian guy doesn't... Doesn't tell him?
Yeah. We probably should've
told him not to tell him. Yeah. Yeah. Mmm. Because he was headed
that same way. Oh, he's for sure headed
to the train station. Let's speed up. He's out of our sight line now. We're getting very close.
We gotta be careful. And the train station's
right there, right? Yeah, mhm. 20 minutes. I have to hide somewhere. You can't really hide if they
have your location all the time. Well, yeah, but if I can
get up or down... (sighs) I think we have to keep moving. Keep moving, 'cause if
we stay here, they'll come. (chuckles) Ciao. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Good to meet you. Adam. (muttering in Slovenian) I don't know, do you
wanna go across here? Yeah, anywhere weird. They aren't here, huh?
You don't see them? No. If this guy's messing with me,
he's doing an amazing job. I mean, he really
might be (bleep)-ing with me. But I have no choice
but to trust him. For some weird reason,
he switched directions. I mean, the tracker's
not that up to date. I think we want to let him
get into the station. Yeah, 'cause he—
Then we have him trapped. Yeah. Yeah, like, if he
went on the platform, there's no chance. Because there's
one exit, presumably. I don't have any
cigarettes, no, sorry. Look, they're
crossing over there. We could go over by that side. Yeah, yeah. Let's do that. Do you see him? ...No. Where is he on the tracker? On the tracker,
he's opposite all of the... I think we gotta go through,
'cause we gotta get to the subway, which is past those people. I mean, the main thing now is just making sure
he doesn't get on that train. Right. Oh! There they are. I don't think they see me. Maybe they just won't notice me? He's there. You see him?
Yeah, I do. Here, let's move up. Okay, get to the crowd,
get to the crowd. Okay, I saw him just lie down. So I think he saw us. No, I think he went... No, he just laid down. He's lying down right now. But how did he
even get to that side? That I don't know. But I can see him right now
through the window. He's lying down. (whispering) Come on. Come on. Get on the train. You don't see me.
Where could I be? Oh, I must be getting
on the train. And then you get on the train. No, I think there's a subway. I literally see him. You do? Yeah, but he's below ground. No, I see him
with my eyes right now. I know, I know,
I know, but he's... He's not lying down. You see how there's that dip? Seems like the vibe is kinda,
you just walk over there. You think we
should give that a shot? Yeah, but he's
gonna start running as soon as we start
walking that way. Yeah, seemingly, seemingly... Let's give pressure.
This is the Slovenian way. Well, what do we do now? Not a lot of good options. Alright, they're heading
towards me. We've got one shot. End of the line, brother. Sounds like
the vibe is just like— Alright, go get him.
Go get him, Sam. Sam, I really don't like
the fact that we're running. That's a tag. I've been training, Adam. What do you think
of Nova Gorica, Ben? It's a good run!
Yeah! The Slovenian people
have been very nice to us. Well, the Slovenian people
were trying to trick you. Were they? Did the teen come up to you and point you the wrong way? No.
No. A teen didn't
point you the wrong way? Come up to us and say, ""Oh, I saw him in the store.
He was getting cheese balls."" Yeah, that might've
been my guy. But then my guy, he at least seemed like
he was trying to help me. Well, no. He walked me around
and tried to help. At least he said
he was trying to help. He offered to stash me
in his house. Which one?
Wow. (laughs) I don't know,
the Slovenian teen. His name was, I think, Teo. What'd he look like? He had dark, sort of
buzz-cutted hair. Oh, I think I saw that guy
following us around. The dude's playing all sides. It's hard to say
what he was doing. Alright.
Alright, Sam. It's 2:50. So we will start
chasing after you at 3:35. Alright. Good luck. Good bye. See you in Lyon! Wait, what was the way? This way. Okay. Well... Well, that's— I'm actually
thrilled by that. Yeah, you got pretty deep
into your territory. I mean, I made it
to Slovenia. And you got us to
a pretty sticky spot. I think that Sam is gonna
have some trouble getting far. Oh, I agree. I mean... What is his plan,
do you reckon? This is not how I wanted
to necessarily start my run, but I think I might have
found a really good move. I'm just not sure. I'm really just not sure. (sighs, grumbles) God dammit. Caption+ by JS*
Transcription: Roger Maiz, Marco Settembre Ben! Yeah? Did you know that the
next episode of Jet Lag is available right now on Nebula? Nebula? I don't have Nebula. Well, great news!
You can sign up for it at nebula.tv/jetlag. And you can also,
in addition to watching the next episode one week early,
which is right now – you can watch the
next episode right now – you can also watch an entirely Nebula-exclusive
show that we made called The Getaway. Wow! It's a great name, and it has
an even better premise. Because what we did is we took six creators,
we gave them $10,000, put them on an old VW bus, and had them transported
across the American West. But among them is a Snitch, a saboteur who's trying to
undermine the efforts of the group. Sounds a whole lot like
you've heard of The Traitors. Or The Mole.
Yeah, it's a lot like The Traitors. So we added a twist. What we did is
we told all six of them that they were the saboteur. What?
Yeah, it's true. That sounds really funny. We we tricked all of them
into thinking that they were each
the star of the show, when in fact it was all of them. Oh, I get it. It's like a commentary
on influencer culture. You know, it's a commentary
on influencer culture. Or capitalism.
And capitalism. And also just a dang fun show
that we worked really hard on, that we really think
that you'll enjoy. Yeah.  Yeah.
Yeah.  Yeah. But, I don't know. A whole streaming site just
for one week early stuff? Sam, no. Sam, don't worry.
And that, and no show. Sam, don't worry,
because... also, with your
Nebula subscription, you get access to our exclusive aftershow podcast,
The Layover. Where we get into
the behind-the-scenes of every single episode. Every single one?
We talk about all the strategy. So if you want to get the best possible Jet Lag
viewing experience, you gotta listen to
The Layover afterwards. And plus, with your
Nebula subscription, you also get access to
a giant catalog of content by other creators that
you know and love. Like RealLifeLore
has this great show I've heard of him.
called Modern Conflicts. There was another episode
that just came out. There's so much good stuff
to watch on Nebula. So why do you not have a Nebula
subscription, is my question. That's crazy. I mean... I think the real reason is I haven't been offered
a discount code. Oh my gosh,
well I can fix that. Really? nebula.tv/jetlag! Whoa! What does that
give me, 10%? 40% off, you guys! That's so many percents. And Sam, let me
tell you something else that's gonna blow your mind. If you sign up for Nebula
using our code, then you help
to support the show. Because we get a portion
of your subscription fee for as long as you
stay subscribed. That's a pretty good deal. It's not a bad deal, Sam. I should sign up. Yeah! At nebula.tv/jetlag,
I think is what you said, right? That is what I said.
I said nebula.tv/jetlag. Or at the button
that's maybe on the screen. Oh my god! Bye."

Carbon offset by the Gold Standard: https://registry.goldstandard.org/credit-blocks/details/432512","Lf62N-s42_o","Welcome to the final day and grand finale of
Jet Lag: Australia. Right now, both teams have
plausible paths to victory. Toby and I are starting
the day in South Australia with four regions under our control, enough to secure the win
at the end of the game. As long as we successfully
defend our territory, or make an equal number of trades, the win is ours. Ben and Adam,
on the other hand, are starting the day in
the Northern Territory with only three regions, but thanks to some
huge wins last night, they have more money than us and a flight already
booked to Brisbane. If they can use that money
to flip more of our regions than we can flip back,
we're toast. It's all going to
come down to strategy, anticipation, and clever timing. So, without further ado, day four. Good morning! Good morning and
welcome to the final day of season 10 of
Jet Lag: The Game. It is 6 am in the outback. And it is time, 7 o'clock. Let's go. Very confusingly
30 minutes off. Now you might be thinking, ""Oh, well doesn't
the game start at 7:30 am? That doesn't make any sense."" Yeah, because this is
a half-hour time zone. We're an hour and a half
behind Sydney. Makes no sense.
Makes no damn sense. But you know
what does make sense? The beautiful sunrise. That makes a lot of sense
to me. And also our plan. And also our plan,
which is a very good plan. Our plan is very good. I have been... crying, screaming,
and throwing up over the fact that they won
$3,000 late last night. Yeah, it looks like...
It's really, like... Looks like they had... ...concerning.
...a lot of cool adventures, yeah. That made me a little ill,
not gonna lie. Well, yes.
But keep in mind that no matter
how rich they are... they're only going to
have six hours after they get to Brisbane
to do whatever. And after I calmed down
from that shock, I realised we still have
a pretty good chance at victory. I don't want to give
too much away... but we're going to Brisbane,
as you know. And then we have a plan to flip
two more of their regions. Yes. Essentially, we think
that we can flip three regions that they
are currently holding. They are probably
going to try and steal two of our regions today: Brisbane and one other. And all we have to do is steal those two regions
back from them. And... if you're doing the math,
they're up by one region right now. Yep. So if they can flip
three regions... Then they win.
Then they'll win. But I don't know that
they can do that, Ben. If they earn more money today,
things get worse. But if they have the current
amount of money they have, they don't have enough
to get three of our regions. We have an endgame that
I'm pretty excited about. Yeah. And I don't know
if they've thought of it. But, this is all to say... I don't know what flights
they could take. I don't know what steals
they might get. A steal would really blow
this whole thing. A steal could set us back. Because a steal
could take, you know, upwards of $2,000 from us. And that would mean
that we would have to... Yeah, that could basically
blow this whole thing. So, that's something
that, you know... we're hoping doesn't happen.
(cracks up) Yeah, but I think
the first thing to do is... we can make our budget
a little more steal-proof... by taking a look at
today's Challenge Board. Should we check out
our challenges? Yep. First one, 1.5x multiplier: Identify chocolates at
Haigh's Chocolate Factory. Probably not gonna be open
for a while, unfortunately. Yeah. Number two... 30% steal. We gotta have them
pick up and take a wallet that has $50 in it
within 10 minutes. The third, complete 10 obstacles
on the MegaClimb. For 2.5x, that probably
doesn't make sense. And the last one,
1.5x multiplier: dump one ocean
into another ocean. Also probably too time consuming. I think, to me, the only thing
worth considering... is the steal. Let's take a look-see. Teach from afar at the
Alice Springs School of the Air. Okay, so the Alice Springs
School of the Air is this cool thing where
there's radio school because a lot of
this region is so sparse that they can't have regular school. ""Sail"" across the Todd River. So the Todd River is
famous in Alice Springs for not having any water.
Yes. So, ""sailing' across it
would mean we would have to build,
basically, a cart. Master the Dewey Decimal System. You have to go to a library, and you have three minutes
to find this certain novel. That's a 2.5x.
Okay. And then get upcharged. So, in this one,
you have to go buy an item, and then go to another store, and find the same item
for more money. And that's a 2x.
Mm-kay. Here's the thing, look. We have enough money
to do what we need to do. We should not risk any of it unless we are
very, very confident that we're not going to lose it. Now talk to me
about the steal. What do you think
about the wallet? How about let's go
under that cover there and get out of the rain
while we discuss? The steal is basically
the only thing we'd reasonably want
to consider right now. If we keep
the amount of money that we have right now,
I think, based on... you know,
yesterday's flight prices that we'd have about
900 spare dollars. And well, 30% of our money
is more than $900 right now. Yeah, so I don't... ...personally love the idea
of risking our buffer. But what do you think? I don't think we need it. There are certain situations where if we were... not in as strong of a position
right now as we were, where we would want
to take that risk. Yeah. But I think we're in a
decently strong position, so... I at least think it doesn't
make sense to do the steal now. No, I agree. I think we should do it
if they get any more money. But we have enough money.
We have enough money. We don't need to take any risks that we— that are unnecessary. (sighs) I mean, the truth is, I think we could do
the Todd River thing. I think we could. I think maybe we should go
check out the Todd River, get more of a vibe. Yeah, let's go examine it. And you know what? Then we can tell you
about the river, at least, because it's pretty interesting. Let's pretend... ...you're us,
I'm Ben and Adam, and let's wargame it. I think their winning move would be to put a decisive
claim on Queensland that we can't beat. We can't really afford to have
any of our cities stolen today that we don't get back. If they go to Brisbane
and match us... with their current budget,
they'd have $2,900 left over. You're saying what if they put
a bunch of that on Brisbane? If they, yeah,
so if they put an amount that we cannot match
on Queensland... Yeah. They can't do that unless... Unless they get a lot more.
Unless we can't get from here to Queensland for... $900. Because they— Okay, assuming they
don't earn more money, they'll have $2,900 in Brisbane. We have $3,800. So we can match this
in Brisbane as long as we can get a flight
to Brisbane or Gold Coast for $900. And assuming they
don't earn more money. Yeah. If they earn more money
this morning, a lot of these plans are
a lot more dubious. They're back at the river. What does that mean? I still kinda feel like
you could get stuck. Yeah, it's... I mean... It's... not very solid ground. And at least here... The river is pretty wide. Yeah. I personally don't feel
great about doing this in time to make our flight. I mean, I'm just saying,
if we don't earn more money, then a steal could ruin the plan. I mean, we need $4,027
to execute on the plan. I guess the point
I'm making is the amount of money
we would have to risk on a bet right now... in order to put us
out of the steal... scary zone... Mhm.
is more... If we then lost that money, we wouldn't have enough
to execute on our plan. Yeah. Okay, let's don't do it. I think we're fine. If they hit us with a steal, we could earn back
enough money later that we can still make
our plan work. It would be a little tricky,
but... doable. And good content. (sighs)
We love good content. So, Ben and Adam
headed off to McDonald's. But back in South Australia, Toby and I could not figure out
what they were possibly up to. And anticipating their next move
mattered to us a lot. We were pretty sure
that Ben and Adam only had the time and money
to make it to Queensland and one other region
we controlled. So our plan was to fly to
Melbourne, flip Victoria, and then fly to one
of those two regions to steal it back before
the end of the game. This plan, however,
had one big weakness. If Ben and Adam managed to
make even more money today, they might be able to put down
big enough deposits that we wouldn't be able
to steal that region back. That meant that we needed
a big cash infusion now, and there was only one way
we could guarantee it: put all of our money
– every single dollar – in the ocean challenge. This would involve taking
at least 6 ounces of water from one ocean
– the Pacific, Indian, or Southern – and dumping it in a different ocean
by the end of the day. Theoretically, we could scoop up
part of the Southern Ocean here, dump it in the Pacific Ocean
when we get to Melbourne, and secure enough cash to compete
at the very end of the game. We were confident we couldn't fail. But doing this meant
locking up all of our budget until we got to Melbourne. So if Ben and Adam did
something unexpected, or could somehow steal
more regions than we anticipated, we wouldn't have
the flexibility to change course for the next six hours. So, okay, so... I think it makes sense. Just the idea of... plotting out our
entire game day now... ...has me scared.
(titters) I'm shaking because
I can't even type... I can't even type
into Google Maps because I don't know
what to do. I'm very scared,
but I think we should go. (sighs) I agree... I agree. We're either gonna
win or lose on this. That's kind of how everything
goes today, but yes. Let's go to the beach. They're at McDonald's. McDonald's?
Yeah. What are they doing there? Probably getting a snack
on the way to the challenges, which is good. Oh, you think
they're in The Snack Zone. So, on the map it shows us,
you might say, ""Okay, oh, they're in
the Northern Territory."" But if you look at
this other map... it actually shows us
right in The Snack Zone. So welcome to
The Snack Zone. We're gonna be trying the... Hot Cross Bun
with Cadbury chips. Ow. That is bread
with chocolate in it. Yeah.
For sure. Or maybe
The Breakfast Zone, but... Do you see what
my earrings are today? Do they look good on me? That's the opposing side. You're supporting the enemy. Oh, no, no. Everyone loves
The Snack Zone. It's the premier snack show. What about Choo Choo Chew? Are you eating? What does that
have to do with it? I know that the map says
that we're behind, but I don't feel that way. No, the map... The map is misleading you. The map... The map doesn't really
understand our desert power. Yeah. The map doesn't sort of have
a metric for desert power. No.
We have a lot of desert power. Well, actually,
let's add that to the map. Graphics team,
add a desert power meter. A desert power— yeah, yeah.
And put ours pretty high. Theirs is—
Theirs is almost— It's in the— It's nothing. You'll see the graphic. We have a lot of desert power.
They don't have very much. Yeah.
If any. And actually,
could we keep that up for the rest of the episode, in the top— bottom right, the desert power meter? Yeah. For the rest
of the season, that's the metric you're
going to be wanting to watch. Yeah. Welcome to the beach. Smells like the ocean. Yeah. Which ocean in particular
is that, Sam? Can you smell it?
It's a distinct flavour. Yeah, it's giving... It's giving Southern Ocean. Oh yeah, I smell a hint
of Antarctic air in there. Let's place our bet. You know what I think
we want to bet, Toby? Every single dollar,
including that 50 cents. I think we want
to bet $3,274.50. How does that sound to you? I like it. Lock it in. Dump one ocean
in another ocean. Australia lies at the intersection
of three different oceans: the Pacific, the Indian,
and the Southern. Collect at least six ounces
of one of those three oceans and, before the day is over,
dump it into a different ocean. If the day ends, or you lose
the six ounces of ocean before you can accomplish this,
then this challenge is failed. That's breakfast
out of the way. That's breakfast sorted. We're really just— We're taking it easy
this morning, because that is actually,
right now, probably strategically
the best move for us. So, I mean... we've still got about an hour
until we need to go to the airport. We're gonna go check out
the Botanic Garden. Yeah. See if that's any... any... See if it's fun. Welcome to the
Alice Springs Botanical Garden. So far, I would say
there are minimal botanics. I'm seeing some
insanely large spider webs, which in the context of Australia... ...makes me scared. What are you doing?
I'm looking for a water bottle. Can't we just buy one
at the convenience store? Well, why waste
a new water bottle? Man. Okay, man,
they're very diligent about cleaning out their trash cans. That was your last bin. Now we need to go to the store.
Yeah, okay. Let's go to the store. I think we're here
during the wrong time of year for there to be flowers,
unfortunately. Yeah, well, it's evident that no one is in
Alice Springs right now. Ugh, oh, a bug went in my eye. I wonder why. Alright, I think
we can turn back and go to the airport. I think we've experienced
the Botanic Garden. Well, now, now we get to... see how exactly we're going
to make it to the airport. I believe in us. I believe in us too, but... There are no buses
to the airport, so... It's really just a question of... ...how do we find a taxi? We have had
quite a lot of trouble. Let's see if the
Botanic Garden Visitor Center can get us a taxi. Thank you. It was a $5 water bottle. See, that's why we
should have scavenged. Hmm... trying to think
about logistics here. I guess I probably need
to take my socks off. I don't... Oh, I'll try not to film them so that they don't
end up on weird sites. Alright. There it is, Toby. That's him.
Water... with the pulp. You gotta guard this
with your life. We gotta get that bus
to the airport. Yeah.
We got a flight to catch. Do you think
Adam might be confused about why we bet
all our money? What the hell? Thank you so much. It says that they just bet
all of their money. They just bet
all of their money? I wonder on what. You remembered
the water, right? I think it's in my bag. Do you wanna show
proof of life? He's here. Great stuff. Good stuff. Alright, let's go through security. (wheezes)
What could they be doing? Is it the... Is it the dump one ocean
in another? Maybe they're picking up water. Then they'll go to the airport,
fly to Melbourne, dump the water... And Bob's your uncle,
get a bunch more money. Yep. Doesn't matter. That's the only thing
I can possibly think of. But again, I don't think
their problem's money. I think their problem is
time, Ben. I think their problem is time. I agree. And they've already
wasted too much of it. Hey there,
headed to the airport? Alright, Toby, do not
let them take your water. Oh, you made it harder
with the seaweed. Well, honestly, I think
the explanation of... I collect the water
from all the oceans... and I'm about to travel
all the way back to... ...let's say Svalbard...
No, you're making it worse. No, that's
a reasonable explanation. People collect ocean water. But they would know
you are lying, 'cause you're not allowed
to take water overseas. Yeah, well you can say,
I'm checking my bag after this. Or it's on foot.
I don't know. Just defend it with your life. Hi, we're checking in
to Brisbane. Sam and Toby,
we're coming for your regions. Where are they right now? So it looks like
they have just left Adelaide. I don't know where they're going. My guess is Melbourne,
but I don't know for sure. They're gonna have to go to
a lot more than just Melbourne if they want to win this thing. We're going to Brisbane. We have a plan. All we can do is
execute on our plan. It is time to leave the desert and return to wreak vengeance. Sam and Toby, your regions... ...will soon be ours. Thank you. Welcome back to Melbourne. I think we are here
in Melbourne... with a bunch of money
ready to play defense. As long as we
can get to the ocean. Oh, should I check that
the water bottle is still there? You know,
there's always a chance the change in air pressure
could have split the plastic and it spilled all in my bag. Yeah...? Okay, good. I don't want to look
at it too much. I don't want it to get
scared or something. ...Oh. Okay. They could land and realize
they've won for good... if we don't successfully
complete anything. Yeah. Or have a feisty budget. So I imagine it's a little bit
of a stressful fight for them. Yeah, 'cause they don't know
what we're up to. So yeah. And I also feel like they probably woke up
this morning thinking they had it because they did have
more money than us. Or at least a really good chance. And they still have a chance. I think it's still anyone's game. Yeah. We've just gotta— This time now feels
a little bit like chess. Like we have to just
defend our positions. We are willing to lose some if we gain others
and make sacrifices. And we just have to move
our pieces behind their pieces. They absolutely have
paths to victory. Yeah. But I am convinced
that we probably have more. If we're smart about it. If we're smart about it.
Yeah. I think it's kinda gonna
somewhat come down to... ...who anticipates
the others' move... ...more successfully. Yeah. Have a
wonderful day, guys! Bye! Okay, so there's
been a huge problem. Hold on, hold on, hold on. First of all,
welcome to Queensland. We're going to go ahead
and put down our deposit. Cha-ching. Now... We're depositing $1,347, one dollar more than them,
and now we control it. Hooray for us. Okay, but minor crisis. Is it minor? Feels kinda major to me. Potentially major crisis.
Okay. No, those are arrivals. We need the departure board. It's a Virgin flight. Departure. Not that one. Where is it? These are all Qantas flights. Didn't say cancelled.
Let's go. We need to get to the area
where there are Virgin flights. Yes. Okay, so... Basically, we had a flight. Yes. Hi. Sorry.
What's up? We had a flight
that we needed to take, but now that flight
is not showing up. So we need to go
find someone who can maybe get us on it. This actually is sort of
the key to our whole plan. If we don't make this flight,
we are in big trouble. This is looking promising, Toby. Do you smell that, Sam? Sorta, yeah. You smell that?
What does it smell like? There's wafts of
Southern Ocean coming from over there. But... the overwhelming... Yeah, it just overwhelmingly
smells like Pacific. I hope there's
no deadly bacteria in that that you're helping spread. No, it actually all
blew away in the wind. Look at that, Toby,
over there. On the horizon. Do you see that?
What is it? What is it?
Do you see it? Oh... what is it? It's 4,911 dollars and 79 cents!
Woah! That is so much money, Toby! That's amazing. What do you reckon
we do with it now? Oh, Ben. This is so not what I hoped for. We need to find
a Virgin Australia gate agent. Hi, I was trying to book
two tickets on the 3:10, but I was having trouble. To purchase tickets, yeah. I just connected
from Alice Springs. Okay. Ben. Why does it always
have to be hard? Why can't it just be
easy sometimes? Two.
Just two. Yes.
Yes please. When would we arrive if
we went via Sydney or Melbourne? Nah, that wouldn't work. Unfortunately,
that won't work. That won't work. Sure... yeah. Thank you. And you're sure
there's no chance of standby or any way to get
on the 3:10? Okay. Okay, no chance.
Thank you. That flight is full. Oh, Ben. Oh, Ben. (whispering sigh)
Oh, Ben. ...one-one,
and we left $2,000 here... ...450 minus 750... That's if they do
Sydney–Canberra. If they do Melbourne–Canberra,
it's worse for us. ...minus $650, minus $650... minus $1150, minus... ...And if they do
the Sydney route... Oh wait, sorry.
...we have 2,502... So I think we're good. Okay, so should we do
the Avalon flight then? I guess let's make sure
we can get there. Our really, really,
really awesome plan that was definitely going to work has hit what I would call
a massive roadblock. Do you want to explain what our really, really,
really awesome plan was? Yeah. Now that we
seemingly can't do it? Here, I have to do this.
You explain it. Okay. What we were gonna do is we were going to fly
from Brisbane to Canberra, claim that, and then... hop on a bus
right over the border because the Canberra airport's
only two miles from the border of
New South Wales. We wouldn't have to get
all the way to Sydney. We would literally just
have to get over the border, and then there we could deposit in New South Wales
and claim that, and that would lead us to victory. Now, we cannot get
to Canberra on time. So... Seemingly our leading theory is that there is a flight
to Sydney... that gets in at 6:15,
and then... if... we beg... we might be able to book... a flight at 7:05 to Canberra. Because we can't book it
as a connection, because... We can't, no. Because then we wouldn't
be able to deposit. We wouldn't be able
to deposit in Sydney. I'm gonna go ask Virgin how... if we got in at 6:15... If they think we would be
able to book on a 7:05. Well, they're not gonna know. But, they— I mean, I— They might have the rule. They might know what the rule is.
You know what I mean? Clearly, they have a system that
shuts down at a certain point. Okay, I just— I think
if we want to get this flight, we need to book—
It might go away. Yeah, yeah, book that flight. I think that this is
our best option. I'm just gonna book this. We're just gonna have
to try going to Sydney and just pray that
we are able to get on this flight to Canberra. I can't believe that, Ben. Yeah. Okay, we booked
that flight to Sydney. Alright. Oh, let's... pray that this works. I think we found
our path to victory. It's a little bit different
from what we thought. We can explain in more detail
in a moment. We're in a bit of a rush. Alright, flight booked. Now we gotta get... ...not back to the airport. We gotta go to... somewhere
completely different. 2:45, that's us. Ben and Adam have deposited
$1,347 in Queensland. (chuckles deviously)
But counter-intuitively... I think this is great for us. This is great news
for us, actually. They're exactly where we want them. This is good. Especially because we did the thing
we haven't actually explained yet. (giggles)
A lot's happening. Here, wait, show your shirt. ""A lot is going on
at the moment."" Certainly. And they're
probably currently... hurriedly rushing
through Brisbane Airport... ...with some illusion of hope. I don't know
what they're doing, but we'll keep an eye on them. Keep an eye on their tracker.
Yeah. It's very possible
they have some genius plan. The one downside of
the plan of ours is... we're pretty much done for
in terms of flexibility. In terms of where we go. Yeah. So if they somehow have
some sort of cunning something... Plan up their sleeves? Yeah, we, we...
we could be screwed. Pivotal time. Pivotal time.
See you guys later. Heyyy! Oh my god. Wow.
This is huge. Thank you so much. Yeah.
Of course. (whispering) Alright, Ben. I think this is gonna work. Mhm. Well, we'll try to beg
our way onto the 5:55, but that seems like
a lost cause. But if we can make the 7:10, that should be enough. Yeah, that'll be enough. Oh my god.
Oh my gosh. Alright, well...
No. Fingers crossed. Thank you.
Thank you. Okay. (titters)
There's three seats on it? Of course there's
three seats. Alright, I don't
know how much of that was clear to the audience. So, we went back
to the service desk. They were able to change
our 3:35 to Sydney to the 3:05 to Sydney. That means we'll get
into Sydney at 5:35. That's gonna give us
a little extra margin to get on that 7:05
to Canberra. However... she just said that there are only
three seats left on that flight. And of course we can't
book it until we get there. So we just have to hope... that fewer than two people
book on that flight in the next several hours. Why can't it
ever be easy, Ben? Why couldn't we have
just gotten on the 3:10? We cultivated
all of our desert power, and then we were supposed to
get on the 3:10 to Canberra. That's how it was
supposed to work. It's 'cause we left the desert. You can watch our
desert power meter just draining by the minute.
Yeah, yeah. If you take a look at
the desert power meter that we've had up
this whole episode, it's a lot lower than it was. It's a lot lower. But you know what?
It still might be enough. We're gonna see when
we get to Sydney. Jesus.
(laughs) Oh no. Alright, I'm now 99% sure that they're on
this flight to Sydney. Well, that's what we thought. And I think we're feeling... Yeah. You've gotta learn
your geography. Why? What's going on? Just for Jet Lag: The Game. No, you don't. As in... You as in general. Yeah, you've gotta learn
your geography. They're on a bus towards... ...Werribee? Or Geelong, maybe? I don't think there are
any challenges down there. I don't even know why they
would be doing a challenge. 'Cause they don't need
any money. Maybe they're just like... They're just vibing out?
...vibing, hanging out? Seeing the sights? Or they're about to pull some... Or they're about to pull one of the most incredible
tricks we've ever seen. But I think it's unlikely. I don't know.
Look, at this point... ...nothing's out of the question. What are they doing? Who knows. Who knows. Yeah, we've been on the bus
for an hour and a half. It got rather delayed. We should be alright, but the flight does leave
in 45 minutes. Yeah, very small airport. So I think it'll be okay, but... ...yeah, a little tight. A little tight. Yeah. The bus was supposed to get
here 30 minutes ago, but... It should be okay. This airport is a bit out there. Certainly a little bit
more out there than Melbourne Airport. (scanner beeps) Thank you. Okay, here we go. Sydney. Let's hope this works. (exhales harshly) This was not
the plan I hoped for. But it's the plan
we've got now. (clapping) (groans lengthily) Hello. Thank you. (whispering) Okay.
Whew. Alright. Let's get outta here. Classic tight... Yeah, they only
just started boarding, and we're already at the airport,
so that's great. Yeah, this is when
I normally get to the airport. Oh, there we go. Alright, plane's there. (sighs) I think it's going to be
a stressful flight, Toby. Why? What if they've thought
of something we haven't? I feel not so stressed. Okay.
It's possible. They could be up to
anything, I guess. I mean, we've thought
of something they haven't. Therefore—
Okay, to be fair, we think we've thought of
something that they haven't, but they could be
one step ahead of us, and they know what
we think we've thought of, and they've thought of
one thing or more besides. Yes. We'll see. Got it. We definitely didn't
almost forget that, right? We were just doing that
for dramatic tension. Okay, more bad news. While we were in the air,
the price went up on that Canberra flight
out of here, and now it is...
$13 out of our budget? Uh-huh, it's... $13. So I don't want to
think about that too much. Okay, wait, this isn't
showing everything, because I'm missing stuff, so... Now there's a question of if we should try and go
to Melbourne and retake Victoria instead. Because here's the thing. They put down a deposit
of $1,501. But if they're still there and they see that we're
coming to Victoria, they could put down more, and that would put it
out of budget for us. And we would get there, and we wouldn't be able
to take it back. But if they have left,
having only put $1,501 down... then... They might be on— (gasps) I think they left. Do you think they're on that flight
I think they're going to Devonport?
to Devonport. I think they're on a flight
to Devonport, Ben. That means that we need
to go to Melbourne. That means we can go
to Melbourne. That means we can go
to Melbourne. If we can get a flight
to Melbourne. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. Oh. Ohhh (bleep)! Alright, there's
a lot happening. The first thing
we're going to do is go ahead and deposit $1,151...
Wham! into New South Wales. New South Wales is ours! Okay. (raspy) Sorry. Where's the help desk?
There, there, this way. Let's see if they can get us
to Melbourne. They're unavailable? Okay... it's fine. Just go to the gate. The flight to Melbourne.
There's a bunch of them. That's to Perth. We need a departure board. Okay. Departure to Melbourne. The 6:30. 45? Gate 45. 45. Hi there. I'm sorry, we're... Is it possible to get
two tickets onto this flight? Yeah, to Melbourne. Upstairs? Okay. No, we want to purchase one. Which— Where—
Okay, those stairs? Okay. Is it— No, this
doesn't look right. Well, I don't—
They said upstairs. Here? Okay, this seems like a... not an area where
we're allowed to be. I mean, he said upstairs. I know, but... This doesn't seem right.
This seems like an employee space. No, it's not that.
No, this is wrong. Here, let's go back down. Where's the service desk? The service desk? The upstairs service desk? The gate agent told us
to go upstairs. I think we clearly went
the wrong upstairs. I'm trying to book a ticket. Yeah. To Melbourne on the 6:30. It's too late to do it online. So we're going to try to
talk to... an agent. Over here. Okay, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. The guy told us to go
up to the service desk and we went upstairs and
we immediately realized we had very much gone
to the wrong place. I'm sure that
would be lovely too. That's fine.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can we— Can you look
at the departures from where they're going? Because I feel like they have
to be going somewhere else next. Devonport. Oh, great. Yes, that'd be fantastic. That would be perfect,
that'd be perfect. Fantastic.
Thank you so much. Thank you so, so much. Tickets on the flight. We are going to Melbourne. Not where we expected to go. Not where we intended
to go, but you know. I think it's
going to be enough. Unless they have some
way to turn around and get back to
Melbourne or Sydney. I think this might have
just secured us the victory. That might be it. No more surprises, please. Thank you, Ben Doyle. Thank you. I think that might be it. (whispering grittily)
Let's go! Let's go, baby. Adam, where is our
desert power meter at? I think the desert power meter is
extremely high at the moment. Through the roof. Oh my god, I think
she put us in economy plus. That's crazy. Whew. (wheezes) Mm-kah. Didn't even break a sweat. We're on the flight
to Melbourne, Ben. And they put us in
economy plus. And they're in
Devonport, Tasmania. And I think they're
staying there, buddy boy. Two whole days?
Wait, three days. Alright. Welcome to Gold Coast. Ben. Look at where they are. They're on the Gold Coast. They're on the border between Queensland and
New South Wales, Ben. They did not go to Tasmania. No, they did not. Uh-oh. We can reclaim this region by depositing two dollars. What do you reckon?
Should we do that, Toby? Two dollarydoos.
Send them right now. Is it worth it? I think it's worth it. Okay, I think it's worth it. We like this place.
It's nice and warm here. It is nice and warm here. I reckon that's worth it. Let's do that. Let's take Queensland. Alright. Two dollars deposited. We're gonna catch a bus. And then we have... (giggles in anticipation)
...I think one more step. And the airport
is on the border. That could have been
good to know. We did not know that. We're here. Toby? Do you know what this
represents, Toby? Oh yeah. (laughs) Do you know what
this line represents? Shall we? Shall we? Three, two, one. That's New South Wales. That's our fourth region. We haven't claimed it
yet, though. We haven't claimed it yet. I'm gonna ask Ben and Adam to give us a call
once they land, and we can each make
our last moves, let's say. How about that? Great news, Ben. We landed in time. At least we'll make
our deposit. Guess let's go ahead
and do that. Pshoo! Whee!
Yaaay. Sam and Toby said that... ...they want us to call them. Wonder what that could be about. I think they're gonna concede. Hello. Hi, Sam and Toby. Yeah, so we, you know,
we deposited $2 in Victoria, which puts us at 4
and you at 3. And I think that's
the end of the game, right? We wrap it up.
That seems like that. That would be it, right? Wait, I'm gonna... Did we just lose? Do we have anything left? I'm trying to think. I do actually have
something to show you. Yeah, I thought you might. We've got these—
Yeah. An interesting fact
that I'm just now learning. Yeah, we've got these
nice big triangles here. And you might wonder what
these triangles symbolize. I can see the letters.
I figured it out, yeah. Well, there's
this thing that says... That stands for Queensland.
Explains what they're symbolizing. And... this is confusing. You might, at first, think
it stands for ""Nice, Soby wins"". Right.
Well, that would make no sense. I understand why
you might think that. But we came to realize that it actually stands for
New South Wales. Oh. Uh-oh.
Uh-huh. Yeah. And... therefore... I think, Toby,
you're on the right— you're— I've gotta be over here. Yeah, you've gotta be over here.
We've gotta both be together. The two mates
can't be separated. You guys are
really drawing this out. Is there a deposit
you want to make? Or we want to make? I'd like to make two dollars. Two dollars.
On New South Wales. Yeah, I concur. Yeah. Yeah, I thought
you might do that. Yeah, that'll do it. That'll do it. Now, I think there's
actually a motion graphic for this exact moment. Ohh! It's a nice motion graphic. Wow! The motion graphic. Wow. It's got kangaroos jumping over these tall towers. No, no, no,
that's too complicated. That's too complicated. Snakes slithering
up the streets. No, that's too complicated.
And a spider too. That is way too complicated. Alright, well. Sam, Toby... We've said this once before, and it seems we'll say it again. Congratulations
on winning this season of Jet Lag: The Game. We have been trying
to pack light this season. So I don't have a full
metal trophy for you, but I do have this. Whoa! What's that?
It's a balloon. Yeah! But, and I'm gonna... Whoa!
It's getting so long. It's curling all around,
but now I'm gonna take it... (gestures vocally) Whoa! Look at that. It's the first ever inflatable... balloon animal
Jet Lag: The Game trophy. That's awesome! And now I'm gonna let it
fly up into the air. Whooaa!
There it goes. There it is. There it is. Oh my goodness. Wait, wait.
A giant balloon animal. Toby, catch it, catch it. It looks like a kangaroo.
Catch it, catch it. Catch it, catch it.
You got it? I've got it. I've got its feet.
Okay, don't let it go. It might blow away. I've got its feet. I just have one
final question for you. And it goes to Toby. You know, it's been
a long four days. And I guess
I just want to know... ...how are you feeling? Toby has been crossing
this line... constantly. Constantly.
Constantly. And, you know, over there... what time is it over there? 7:30? Yeah...? 8:30. Oh my god. 7:30 again. Your sleep schedule
must just be— Yeah, I feel like I
would take a toll on you. 8:30. Yeah, your sleep schedule
must be just so out of whack. And this is my
fourth state of the day. So, so how do you feel? Well... (yawns) Mate, I'm feeling... ...jet lagged! Wooaaah!
Yea-ha-ha-ha! (hoots)
She said the thing! She said the thing!
Oh my god! Woo-ho-hoo! Alright, that's it for season 10! We're gonna see you next time! See you next time in
season 11! Woo!
Woo! That's a lot of seasons! Whew! Woo! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Thank you so much for watching
this entire season of Jet Lag. We really appreciate you making it
all the way to the end. And believe it or not,
the next thing that we have to tease for you is...
not Jet Lag. It's called The Getaway,
and here it is. Welcome to The Getaway where these six creators
are taking a road trip to transport a $10,000 prize across the great American West. The problem... (on phone)
...there's a Snitch among them! Sabotaging the group
at every turn. The Gamer? Am I 1,000% sure
I am not the Snitch? Absolutely. The Zoologist? Is there nothing I can say
to change your mind? The Therapist? You guys trust-trust each other? Actually trust each other? The Card Counter? I'm not— I'm not
throwing shade at you. (giggles)
But the way that I think it would be smart to do it—
Steven! The Finance Guy? This Snitch thing is
very stressful. I go to bed at night,
and I worry. The Political Scientist? I have this suspicion
that... we did get the Snitch. You really never know. Sure.
Okay. This is a tense moment. Okay, here we go. What am I? Alright, nice. (scoffs) Ohh yeah. (giggles)
(chuckles) Snitch.
(chuckles) So here's
what's actually going on. We really like shows that have,
you know, a sabotage element. But there's already so many that have a saboteur. Okay.
Alright. I have this special role. I'm really carrying
this entire series. There's even the ones
that have a couple of saboteurs. Boston I don't believe in.
Jersey I don't bel.... (cracks up, growls)
(others clamor) It's Boston.
Boston was never the city. But as far as we know,
there's none that have... ...everyone as the saboteur. And we thought
that would be funny. In some way, I'm like,
are there two Snitches here? (overlapping shouting) We got— We gotta run! Oh my (bleep) god! (shrieks) There's no script for this.
So, you know... That's a great— Oh, that's gonna make
the trailer, dude. Yeah.
Yeah. You mother— That looks so good! It looks so good!
Oh my god! We made a really good show. We shouldn't actually
set expectations that high. No, but we worked
really hard on it. We really need you
to go watch it. Yeah, it's—it's—it's— It's one of the more interesting
things of all time, I think. That's a huge
statement to make. No, I think that's reasonable. I think that's reasonable.
Yeah, yeah. And to be clear,
the premise here, it's quite interesting. We basically wanted to make
kind of a saboteur show, the idea being it's like
one of these shows where you vote people off
because there's a saboteur. You have to find the saboteur. Except we've told every
single one of the contestants that they're the Snitch,
they're the saboteur. They're, you know, the traitor,
whatever you wanna call it. So they all are playing
as if they're the only one. They all think they're
individually the main character. Yeah, it was really stressful It was pretty funny.
to keep that secret. But where can they watch it? Uh, Nebula. Yeah, this,
we do wanna be clear. This will not go up on YouTube. This is a Nebula Original because they paid us a lot
of money to make a big thing. So if you wanna see what happens
when six people all think that they're the main character
in a show simultaneously.... This is the show for you. nebula.tv/jetlag is
where you could go sign up to watch the show. The premiere will be
happening on this date, which is not that long from now. And while it's true
this will stay only on Nebula, for those of you who want to

to episode five of Jet Lag: Australia, where two teams are
competing for control of Australia's eight regions. Right now, the board looks like this,
and the teams are here. My partner Toby and I are
on our way to the airport, on our way to Adelaide,
to steal it from Ben and Adam, who, you may notice, are in
a pretty unusual location. Because of a flight mix-up
last episode, they were left with no choice
but to retreat to Alice Springs in the middle of the outback
in order to claim the Northern Territory's
welcome bonus. Now, their plan is to
rack up a huge budget and return tomorrow, the final day, to steal my and Toby's regions. So let's see if it works. It's gonna be hot. Oh yeah, buddy. Oh baby. Welcome to the outback. Welcome, folks,
to the outback. Oh, we can feel it.
Where it's so hot that it's crazy. But I tell you what,
it's a dry heat. It is a dry heat.
It's a dry heat. It's a dry heat. Who coulda expected? Here's what I'll say,
once we put our money down here, that means that there are
seven regions in play. And so if you want to win,
you're gonna need four of them. That's true,
you need four to win. If they're going to Alice now, I think we're in a scenario where it's going to be
seven regions in play. Once we lock up Adelaide,
we can essentially just follow them. The bus is picking up in one minute,
so let's just get on the bus. Okay, so we were just realizing the best move for
Ben and Adam right now. They could leave a dollar. You know, all they'd have
to do is leave a dollar in Northern Territory to claim it, and there's no chance
we challenge that. That'd be a good strategy. They might secure
themselves Alice Springs. Do you wanna go ahead
and put down a dollar and be in control of four regions? Let's just do it. I'll feel good. Great. I mean, the truth is, I don't know that we... put more than a dollar
down here at all. No, no, I—
Because I think it's like, the real cost to them
is coming here. Basically, I don't think
that they could win the game by... No.
...coming here. I think that this is
kind of a lock for us. Back at the airport. What was your name? Andrew.
Do you want to say hi? Hello! Nice to meet you guys. Good luck on the challenges,
and I hope you beat Ben and Adam. I appreciate it. We will, in your honor. Real quick reminder. Toby and I are in the
middle of a challenge where we had to go to the
National Portrait Gallery and choose a famous person to draw. Our drawing must then
be correctly identified by our audience in an online survey. The Portrait Gallery did not have the recognizable people we expected,
like Queen Elizabeth. So we've been forced to go
with a less-known option. Alright, we've made it to the
designated airport drawing location. It's crazy that they have those. Yes, I'm gonna draw. It's not gonna be amazing,
but I think I can do okay. This is Kathy Freeman
winning the 2000 Olympics, I think the 400 metres. So I'm going to try and draw
this with the Olympic rings. And then I'm going to
kind of amalgamate it with this of her carrying
the flags. Like, yeah. So I think we—
I reckon we have 20-something minutes
probably to draw. Okay, I'll try to
do a good job of it, but really no guarantees.
Yep. (Adam and Ben sigh)
Ben, welcome to Anzac Hill. It's so hot. Let's take a look at the challenges. I mean, I'll go ahead
and say right now. We need to earn a lot of money. Yeah.
We need to earn big money. Ugh, oh, the bugs. (sighs) Collect 100 animal points
at Alice Springs Desert Park. This is a 2.5x. Basically it just involves
going to this park and finding a lot of animals. I think it's sort of risky. Send a telegraph at the
Northern Territory's oldest telegraph station. So we have to go to the
Alice Springs Telegraph Station, and we have to
actually build a device that can communicate
in Morse code. Score a bogey on any hole
at Alice Springs Golf Club. Now this is a 3.5x. A lot of points. And to sense
the passage of time. This is a 3x. We have to
– without looking at any clocks – wait around for
exactly a half-hour. Three minutes allowance
on either side. It's a tight allowance. Whoa!
(chuckles) I've drawn this. I mean, it looks great. It's actually better
than I thought, so... I was skeptical to be honest,
but that's pretty iconic. Alright, take a photo
of this and post it. Alright, the poll is posted. I can't wait to see
what they say. We're good. It's fine. (sighs) Here's what I'll say. I think the telegraph one,
with a lot of time investment, we could make almost a guarantee. Yeah. I will also say... I think I could get a bogey. You do?
I am very bad at golf... but if we have 18 holes
to get one bogey... I think the odds are very high
that I could do that. And it's a 3.5x. I played golf once. Yeah, were you good at it? I don't remember. Mm, okay. Check this out.
This is Qantas' brand new A220 that's painted in that
sort of indigenous design. There's only one of these,
and it's such a cool design. I love it. Interesting. We got it. I think, usually you can
pick it up on the next line. Do we want to deposit
any more here? Well, how do you feel? (sighs)The strategy would say, we don't need it, I think. Same feelings for me. I think I'm leaning towards
just leaving it alone. Alright. Okay, here's the thing. If we want to win... right now, I think
they are about to go... probably to South Australia
and take it. That's gonna put them with four
and us with three. Tomorrow, I think we, if we want a solid
chance of winning, I think we need to be able to
claim at least two of theirs. Two, ideally three of theirs. If we want to
take New South Wales, we need $1,200.
$1,100-something. Brisbane is $1,340-something. And it seems like
they are going to be leaving the Capital Territory
with not that much. It's going to cost $1,300
to get out of here. It's expensive. I think we need
roundabout $4,000 between now
and the end of the game. That doesn't mean
we have to make it all here or make it all today.
Mhm. But we need to get started. I'm sort of of a mind... that we bet a lot on
the telegraph. And we lock that in... nail it. That's our cash builder. And then with the cash
we earn from that, we bet big on golf. Yeah.
That's kinda where I'm at. The desert park, I just— I don't like when stuff's
out of our control. What are the only
challenges we've failed? The ones that were
out of our control. It's true.
It's 'cause we're so good. But I'm serious! Oh, a bug went in my nose. There's so many bugs. A bug went in my nose. I think $600. 600 bucks. Okay, let's do that. It is a way down. Okay, the bus can take us
straight to a Bunnings. Supposedly... the bus will come in eight minutes. Alright, great. Big win for
Alice Springs' transit network. (indistinct)
Oh, okay. Thank you.
Have a good day. Alright. Alright, Benjamin,
we're back at Bunnings. Back at Bunnings, look. Now, we were talking about how exactly we want to
build this telegraph. And we essentially think
that what we need to do is we need to make a device that's just like a tube
that can transport objects. Yep.
And then we have to have an object that represents
a dot, an object that represents
a dash, and an object that
represents a break. And if we are able to
do that, I don't see... there being any way to
misinterpret that signal. Nope. Famous last words, but... it should also be
pretty easy to build. Yes. We just need to
get a tube. This could be our... I do not trust that
even a little bit. Stuff's gonna get stuck in that. Not a chance. No, the hole's... Literally not a chance.
...a little small. Not a single chance
in the world. Alright, alright.
No. This is what I'm talking about. Yeah. This is what
I'm talking about. Oh, yeah. Do you think that's ten feet? It's nine feet and ten inches. It's kind of annoying. I guess we could put
little extensions on it. Yeah.
(tube bwomps) And now we just need to find what we're gonna send through. Look at these rainbow pebbles. Yeah. And then we determine,
you know, one to be a dot and
one to be a dash. Alright. The unfortunate truth is that we have to hike a mile
to get there. You know what? It's fine.
We've got our telegraph, and we are going to hike
it into the outback. And there, I think we've got
this challenge on lock. I think, frankly,
the biggest risk is that we die. Where are they, by the way? Last I checked,
they were at the airport, but it seems like they've
been there for a long time. If I were them, I would've taken
the 2 pm to Adelaide. Uh-huh.
Which we, frankly... don't have a very good
grip on right now. But who knows? Who knows
where they could be going. Out into the outback... mate! The bugs, they love my orifices. See, remember
before we were saying that we were doing Dune? Yeah.
Right? We were going into the desert after a bit of a defeat
to cultivate desert power and emerge, you know,
victorious. And this, Ben,
this is Shai-Hulud. This is the desert worm
that is going to lead us... into... into victory. (spits) Ugh. A bug went in my mouth. We're getting there. I think
it's only ten minutes left. Adam, do you feel like
you're accumulating desert power? I feel like
we are accumulating quite a lot of desert power
at the moment, Ben. That's good, because
I've eaten like five bugs. Yeah... Wait, have you really
eaten them? I mean, look,
they've gone in there. Who knows what happened.
Eugh! (spits) It just sort of doesn't end. Oh, is that it? Maybe. It's gotta be it.
Yep. Now, where is
the historic building? Oh, we could ask at the cafe. Yeah. Hello, okay, so... we've been informed that we can't actually film
the telegraph building, because it's a heritage site. So go ahead and
look up a picture of it. It's pretty cute. Anyway... We're just gonna go ahead
and do it right outside. Okay, now, Adam. Okay. Blue will be a dot,
and red will be a dash. And I'm gonna take
a nice big long pause between each of
these things. Yep, can't wait. Tell me when
you're ready. I am... ready. Here we go. (beads rattling) Dot, dot. Dash. Dot. Okay. You're taking a long pause. I'm going to assume that
that means that's a letter, and dot-dot-dash-dot
is F, okay. Dot-dot, I. Dash-dot, N. I don't know if
I'm allowed to talk, but the number of flies
on my head... There's so many flies,
it's insane. (bead rattling) (moans) It's because I'm not
moving that much. Dot. Oh, they're going
in my ears. Dash. Dot-dash is an A. Okay, dot, dash... (tube twanging) ...dot-dot. Dot-dash-dot-dot is L. Ben, is the word
'final'? Yes, sir, it is. (exhales sharply) Okay, minor crisis averted. Okay. Okay, the one thing that
we should say, for clarification... The reason why we're not
depositing anything here is because we're not allowed to when we're on a connection. It's treated as if we're
on one long flight. Very possible we come back here as the next thing to do.
Yeah. But, we're not
allowed to leave anything. Which is unfortunate,
but them's the rules. It'd seem that Ben and Adam have managed to get
themselves a few coins. Yeah, a few dollarydoos. I think the thing that we need
to focus on now is just... knowing that they're not
going to leave Alice Springs until, at best, tomorrow midday. What is our best strategy
to counteract that? Hi there. Yeah, that would be great. I'm just waiting for my friend. But this is hugely helpful. How long have you been
living in Alice Springs? (chuckles) Thank you very much! Thank you! Well... Well, you told me to stop! (laughs) The driver had a lot
to tell us about... how you can cure cancer
with vibrations. A lot of science going on. We're just gonna check out
the golf course here and see. Hi there. No. Oh, shoot. Okay. We can wait. We can wait, yeah. Okay, great. Can we get some balls
for the range? Yeah.
And then we'll rent clubs. Okay. Alright, let's
set it up in the shade. The question is,
how much do we bet? I mean, here's the thing. I think if we really want
to get back in the game... Yeah. We have got to put a
pretty sizable bet on this one. I agree, and this is 3.5,
so it could be huge money. I am bad at golf,
but I have played golf. I am as good at golf
as you would expect. I think we should do $900. $900? I mean, it's,
I don't know, Ben. I mean, it's a risk.
It's obviously a risk. I just, you know, there— We're gonna have to
take a risk now or we're gonna have
to take a risk later. I think we have
to take the risk now. We have time. We'll take our time. We're gonna go to the range. We're gonna practice our shots. We're gonna go
to the putting green. We're gonna get prepped. And then just one bogey. Alright. This is a new vehicle for Jet Lag. Oh, man. So, I can tell you the basics. Yeah.
Lined up with the ball. Both hands. Just make sure you don't... So that was not great. You need to control the club. You need to be in charge of it. Okay.
Does that make sense? I'm in charge of you. Keep down on it. Oh, lookit.
That went real far. Look, let's be honest. I'm not getting this for us. Yeah, that's true. Okay, I'm gonna go
practice some putting. 'Cause putting is my weak spot. Too little and then too much. That's pretty good. Alright. Adam's just doing some
last-minute practice before we go. I really cannot articulate the stakes of this
to him explicitly because he seems to be... frighteningly relaxed about this. Which is actually... Usually... he's freaked out. And so he's actually
so relaxed that I'm scared. But I don't want to
interrupt this zen state. You ready? I'm all set, I got it.
Alright. We got this. You want to commence? This is a huge gamble. But I think that I can do it. No problem. The spirit of my father,
Todd Chase, is going to flow through me. Yes. And I am going to get...
a bogey. It's kind of like Star Wars,
but a lot whiter. Here we go! Alright, Ben. This first hole is a par 4,
but it's a short par 4. It's a great opening opportunity. Par 4, so that means that
we need to get it in five. Yes. To get a bogey, because
I know what a bogey is. Where are we trying to hit it? See the flag up there? I'm just going to not overdo it. Not gonna overdo it. I'm lined up. It's like Wii Golf. (clean strike) That's okay. It's in the sand
over there. We're gonna hope that
we can find that. Okay, I think we can. That is not disastrous. It should be somewhere
around here, I think. You see anything? ...No. Could really be
kinda anywhere around here. It's right here. Okay, good job. It's kinda in this
tall grass a little bit, which might be
problematic. It's okay. I'm gonna hit...
a six iron. Six iron, that's exactly
what I would have recommended. I'm just gonna go for it. Stay down on it,
nice clean hit. (club strikes) We can work with that. It's not a super strong
hole so far, but we can work with this. If we could get this
on the green... we could have a shot. You got it. (club strikes) Oh, that's good. That's good.
Might be too far. No, that's quite good. I'm very pleased with that. Yeah, good job. We are on the green, Ben! Oh, we're on the green! We're on the green
in three. This is very good. It's a very good start. Now, if I can just
get this in, in two, we'll be all set. I think one thing
I really want to do is not overhit this. Okay... here we go. (club taps) That's okay.
That's not bad. So if we get it in
on this one. Get it in on this,
then this is it. I mean, it's so close. Just really take your
time with this one. There's wind. We might even want
to wait for the wind to— No, no, that's okay. Okay, okay. Yeah!
(both laugh triumphantly) Aaahh!
(cackles) (gritted giggle) Yes! (giggling) Let's go! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Oh... my god, Ben! First hole. First hole! Couldn't have done it better. (grunts)
Couldn't have done it better. (wheezes exhaustedly) Well done. Our first order of business
might be... booking a flight
the hell out of here. Yep. Okay, we want to take
the 10:20 to Brisbane? We're back in it now. Sam and Toby... Wow, you should
be really afraid, guys. We are coming for you. You should be really afraid. Alright. Sam?
Welcome— Oh, were you about to
welcome me? I was just gonna say, big news, big moves
are happening. Oh, but also,
welcome to Adelaide. Anyways, we're in Adelaide. Yeah, and I did notice
on the tracker, it seems like they've had a
fairly successful round of golf. Oh yeah, they got
really rich all of a sudden. I did a little bit of
op research. Both of their flights
out of Alice tomorrow... Have you seen
that they've booked one? No? They just spent some
of their newfound riches. Oh, I was researching
how expensive they were. (stammers) It said
they spent $700 a piece. So a combined $1,400. It's probably this one. They're probably going
to Brisbane then. Oh. We're going to Brisbane. Ben, this rocks so much,
it's hard to express. Okay, well, it looks like... Sam and Toby
just landed in Adelaide. Adelaide? Okay, so they did
connect in Melbourne. Can they get out of
Adelaide today? Maybe, probably, right? Because if I were him, I would
not leave the Adelaide airport. I'd put down $2. So, anyway,
let's get on the bus and see what the challenges are.
Alright. Should we... deposit $2? Just for the lulz? Should we do it now, or
should we do it in the morning? I think we should do it now
just for the lulz. Okay, we can put $2. Alright, I'll send $2 for the lulz.
Should we say hi? We now control... four regions. We're now fully in the lead. This is feeling good. Mhm.
I like this. J1. Alright, well... Adam, we're heading out. We are. We really don't have
anything left to do today, because there's only
two more challenges here. One of them terrifies us, and the other,
the park is going to close. It's also worth noting that... it looks like they've just stolen
South Australia from us. Which was kind of inevitable. We left it as vulnerable
as it could be, but... But again, the key is... we made them go there. So they had to deal with the
inconvenience of getting there. Now they have to deal with the
inconvenience of getting out. Because we learned... Maybe they found a
good flight, but... Adelaide is a
(bleep)-ing death trap. That was what we found. It's a nice-looking downtown. Wait, wait, wait. I've always wanted to do this. Ben and Adam have been here. It's a Jet Lag reference. I know, I got it. Anyway, challenges
are generated. Let's take a look. Alright, first one. It's a 2.5x multiplier. We gotta find 5 different fish
in 5 minutes at Port Noarlunga Reef. Good if it wasn't
so late in the day. Yeah, that could be tough. Second one, 2x multiplier: smuggle sugar in—
to the Sugarloaf. Similar deal. Third one, master the
Dewey Decimal System. 2.5x multiplier. We can do that. Maybe if the library
is still open. Last one we might
be able to do, it's a 2x multiplier: predict a point
of beach volleyball. Anyway, let's... How about let's sit down and... Closes at 7 pm,
the city library. It's— We could walk there. Wait, okay. The Adelaide City Library. 12 minute walk.
Let's start walking. Okay, we can start walking,
but do we even want to do that? I do. Yeah?
Yeah? I'm... I'm not convinced by the odds. Let's get to Anzac Hill. Oh. Oh, keep going.
I saw a cool lizard. ♪ Hello, lizard ♪ ♪ You're molting, good job ♪ Okay. Hey, Ben, maybe this is crazy. But I feel like
I might have an idea of how to do the
wait 30 minutes thing. Listen to me
walking right now. It's pretty consistent, right? Let me— Let me—
Let me cook on it. Let me cook here. This challenge
actually is easy, because you only have to go to
the alphabetical author's name. There's nothing more to it.
I guess, but couldn't it be in multiple different sections? It'll be in the
fiction section, I guess. But what if there's
specifically... an Australian fiction section? Considering it's a
famous Australian book. And we only have three minutes. Why is it three minutes?
That's r— Because that's the challenge. Master the Dewey Decimal System. Visit any local library. From the moment you
step foot inside, you have three minutes to find a
copy of the famous Australian novel, Picnic at Hanging Rock
by Joan Lindsay. You may do general research about the Dewey Decimal System
or the book, but not about the library itself. It sounds like
you want to attempt this. Yeah? So do you know
where we would go? No, I've never
been here before. But we just need to go to L. L for Lindsay. I mean, how much
would you want to put down? What are you comfortable with? I mean, up to you. I'd be comfortable
going up to $250. How are there
this many stairs? I thought we'd walk up
five stairs. Not ten flights of stairs. Okay. I just don't want
to get out of my rhythm. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, hello. So, on our way back
to Anzac Hill, we realized... Or Adam realized at least that he was walking in
a very rhythmic pattern. And we realized that... a really good way to do
the time travel challenge would be by timing steps. Sense the passage of time. Start a timer. Both teammates may not look
at any clocks or timers until you stop this timer. You may not consult any
regularly scheduled thing to use as a makeshift clock. You succeed if you stop this timer within 3 minutes of
the 30 minute mark. So I have a
very consistent gait. So I walked for a little bit,
counted my steps, timed it, did the math. I walk 1.84 steps a second. So, five minutes,
that would be 553 steps. I just walked 553 steps. I stopped the timer at
5 minutes and 1 second. So...
Pretty good. That was almost
no margin for error. We have a
10% margin for error. Yeah. We're pretty flush
right now with cash. We need more of it. How much do you want to
put down on it, yeah? It's time to put your money
where your mouth is. I mean, I want to
put down at least $1,000. At least $1,000? I'm gonna nail this. I'm going to crush this, Ben. (laughs) Okay. Okay. I, honestly— I would feel comfortable
betting $1,500 on it. Oh my god. Let's put $1,000 on it. $250. You're happy with $2.50? Yeah. Well, it starts
the second you walk in here. You have to help, okay? Yeah.
L-I-N-D, fiction. Okay, you ready?
Yeah. Okay, this is looking good. I see an L. Oh, this is looking good. Okay, this is easy. L-I, L-L. L-E. LIN, LIN. It's gonna be here,
it's gonna be here. It's gonna be here.
Can you see it? L-I-N. Can you see it?
It should be right here. We've got $1,000 on it? Yep.
Alright. Okay, whew. I'm admittedly a little
nervous about this. If we win this, I think
the game may be ours. Okay. Okay. When you're ready. Go! They might have
put it somewhere else. Go look for Australian fiction. Okay. There's The Secret
of Hanging Rock. I'm trying to see if
they have a large print. What's this category? This is large print. Maybe they have
a version that's famous. No, it's not.
It's not on this shelf. There's LIN there.
'Kay, found it. I don't know why it's not here. Oh, it could be in Young Adult. Go to Young Adult. Okay, we only have 30 seconds. Go, go to Young Adult. I don't know where it is. Teens. It would have been here. Sam, it would have been here. We got five seconds. L, L. Quick, quick, quick. Get L as soon as you can. We're done, we're done. Time's up. It's gotta be here. Well, time is up regardless. (sighs) Well, that's that.
I mean, onto the next thing. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that happened. No worries. (muttering count) ...48, 49, 50, 51, 52... ...four, five, six... ...95, 96, 97, 98... ...67, 68, 69, 70, 71... What now? So, my thinking about tomorrow... We're sort of in the same
budget realm as them. And therefore I think we
just need to be very smart about how we use our budget. It does look like,
for what it's worth, they're down to $1,264, but it looks like they're
in the midst of a challenge. That tells me, to be honest... I think they're
playing pretty riskily if they're staking
$1,000 on a challenge. 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen... I think the best strategy
is probably to be... responsive to what they do. Mhm. I mean, in my mind,
it's really just between... Well, it really is between
three things actually. Do we go to Brisbane, and there's
one clear flight at 10:30? Do we go to Victoria first thing? Or do we just give ourselves
maximum flexibility by staying downtown,
not booking anything... and just seeing
what happens in the morning? Because you know, if there's
a great challenge flop... then it is maybe quite nice
to do the challenges, boost our budget to
some crazy amount, and then just
dot-dot-dot around. Well, this is the only place where we'll ever be able to do
another challenge because... Yes, because we don't
want to spend time— Anywhere else we go,
we don't want to be going in and out. Yeah. How much budget
they have in in the morning, how much budget
they earn in the morning will tell us a lot
because that'll tell us what flights they can afford,
what deposits they can afford... and all sorts of
stuff like that, so... I lean towards
maximum optionality. I agree.
Stay in the city. Because— I agree
because I think... I think we have a lot of
good options tomorrow. But it's not like we have
a clear path to victory. There's so many uncertainties. So, it's a lot down to
how their challenges go. Let's keep our options open. Alright. There's a huge pool
of options. We don't know what we're doing. We don't know
where we're going. So... But I hope their challenge
is going poorly right now. I'm sorry. ...Yeah. 93, 94, 95, 96, 97... (muttering count) ...98, 99, 100... Get ready. ...15, 16, 17... Stop! Ben, Ben. Oh my god. Alright, I'm counting
in my head. (cackles) (laughs heartily) Get absolutely got! I was at—
I was at 27 minutes. You would have lost. Yeah, yeah, just barely. Oh my god! That's insane. That's insane. So Ben, what is that? $3,000? That's a cool $3K in the bank. And Ben, we now have
$4,264. With our flight already
booked to Brisbane. That is enough for us to do
the whole run tomorrow. And steal all three of
their territories, I believe. What'd I tell you? It's the desert power. We harnessed the desert power.
As in Dune. As written in Dune.
We have cultivated desert power. Ben, the amount of
desert power we've cultivated... Unbelievable. Dune. Dune. Dune! Dune! Dune!
Dune! Dune! Dune! Dune! Dune! Dune!

of Jet Lag: Australia, where it's the end of day two,
and things are heating up. As a reminder,
the team that controls more of Australia's eight region
at the end of four days wins. You control regions by
depositing money in them, and you can earn more money
by gambling on challenges. Right now, both teams are in the
middle of high-stakes gambles. Ben and Adam are in
Melbourne, Victoria, and placed $1,000 on a challenge that requires them to build a cart that will travel 30 feet
with a single push. And they only get one try
to get it right. Meanwhile, my partner Toby and I, who are in the
Australian Capital Territory, just bet all of our money, $1,243, on a challenge that requires us to correctly identify
ten flags of the world, and the random number generator
just picked a sequence in the section that Toby memorized. So now, our fate is in her hands. (sighs) It's you. Heck yeah. You feeling good? Yes. Alright, let's find the ninth flag. And then it's the ten after that. So, the starting flag... is this one. Are you ready?
Yep. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Botswana. Brazil. Open up in the wind. Alright, here we go. It's got to pass me,
the finish line. Ready? (wheels rattling) Oh, that's it, baby!
Yeah! Ohohoo! Oh, look at how far it goes! F1 champions! Look at how far it goes. We have the F1 champions! Oh, we just won
the big F1 race, Ben! Woo, okay! Okay, I think immediately, we deposit $1,000
in Victoria right now so that we're not
vulnerable to a steal. We're flush with cash,
which is dangerous. We don't want a repeat
of this morning. No.
We've learned. Okay, let's get the money down. Ohh, phew.
Thank god. Brunei. Bulgaria. After that we have Cambodia. Canada. Chile. China. Now that, my dear friends... is Colombia. Alright, let's check our work. This is all or nothing, Sam. This is for the game. Alright. First one. We're correct. Second one, correct. Third one, Brazil, correct. Correct. Correct. Correct. Correct. For the win... (laughs) Chile, correct. Yay! (giggles) Double check the final two. 
I'm really happy. I'm really happy I could do that. China, Colombia,
ten out of ten. Ten out of ten. Two hours ago, I didn't
know half of these at all. Yeah.
You know, not even a faint image. And they say Jet Lag
isn't educational! Pfft! You wanna know what
our earnings are, Toby? Oh, I'm excited. What do we got? (giggles) Yes.
That's a big number. Yes. Has anyone had a
higher balance than this? If it's not the max balance,
it's pretty close to it. Oh my god. Adam and Ben are not
gonna know what hit 'em. Wahaha! We did it, Ben! He's the best driver
in Formula One history. Nobody's ever seen
somebody drive this good. Red Bull, sign that man! Woooooo! Sam, the rats are gonna
hate this announcement. And the rats are Ben and Adam because they're from New York. But the rats don't run this city. We do!
We do! The last thing that
we should decide, I think... before we hit tomorrow morning... I think we should
toss some money down in case a steal comes up,
because our balance is high. But we can walk and talk. Let's walk back towards Parliament.
Let's walk back to the spot. This is not a region
we want to come back to, because it's hard to get to. Yeah. So we want our deposit to be... substantial. We have seen
just now the power possible from doing a challenge
you're confident on and putting a big bid on. We want to keep... a good amount of money
in our bank account for any other challenge
that we're confident on and we could really...
Yeah. But I'm happy with $750. Okay, so let's pop $750 down in the edge case that they
are about to do a steal. But I don't see why
they would do that. Yeah. Hello! We are back here at
Flinders Street station. We'll be ending our day here because we want to be
right here tomorrow morning to see what the challenges are. This is cool. We're ending the night
in Canberra. Yeah. Just walking back to the
Challenge Board location so we can start there tomorrow. We talked a lot about a lot of different
flight options tomorrow. I think the ultimate decision is... we just need to see what
the challenges are in Victoria before we really do anything. Yeah, we just, we need to be
as responsive as possible over these next two days because the fact of the matter
is just that... regions are going to be
going back and forth between the two teams,
and we just— we don't want to
take ourselves out of the game. We definitely played
today slower, but I think we ended up
playing it smarter. At least after the bottle thing. And it... seemed to work out pretty well. That was
dark night of the soul, doing the bottle. But now we've
moved on from that. I mean, we're finishing the day
with a hefty budget. And a nice deposit here. And a pretty good plan
of what to do tomorrow. Great.
I'm feeling pretty good. So, we're just gonna
wake up tomorrow morning. We're gonna see
what's on the Board. We're gonna see what they do. And we'll see you then. Good night.
Good night! (smooch) Alright, with day 2 over, marking the game's halfway point, it's time for another rest period. And now, welcome to day 3! Good morning from Victoria! Good morning! My light's not on. And we are so back, Toby. So back.
So back. It is day 3, we're in
the Capital Territory, and we've got some
fresh new challenges. You ready for them? Or wait, do we want to... Is there any possibility we're worried about them
getting a steal in a second? And Ben, here are
today's challenges. Let's hear 'em. (laughs) Okay. They're all really risky. Find a penguin at St. Kilda Pier. Find an indigenous plane. There's this plane with
indigenous paint on it. And... sometimes it's at the airport. Predict the train doors. This is a 30% steal
where you have to stand where you think a train's
going to arrive... and line up with the door. And then catch a fish. Which is a 50% steal.
Catch a fish. You have 45 minutes from
when you start fishing. Look, let me tell ya,
let me tell ya. Fishing in Australia again... scares me real bad. I did not know that fishing
could be this stressful. I will say we did succeed. We did succeed, technically. No, let's take a look
at the challenges first. Okay, okay. I think we— okay, let's
look at the challenges. Okay, first challenge. It's get a hole in one at this
mini golf course over there. Challenge 2, it's a 2x multiplier, we have to trap a bug
in Vegemite. Challenge number 3,
also a 2x multiplier, we have to do a portrait of
someone in the Portrait Gallery and have the general public
identify it successfully. Oh my god, there's a bee! Challenge 4,
1.5x multiplier, but it's: do a quiz based on what we learn
at Questacon, the museum. Oh, I love that! I know you're very good
at mini golf, but... Nope. (bleep) Oh my god. (bleep) (grunts) Oh (bleep) Personally, I don't think
that's the one for us. The other three, though,
sound very doable. I like that. Can we acknowledge
how lucky we are to be under a hot air
balloon show right now? This is very special.
Wait, I have to zoom in. Balloons! Balloons. Okay, but back to the game. The war is on. We're going to be going
for their territories. They're going to be going
for our territories. I think that's right. We think that they have
left themselves vulnerable. We think that the regions that
they have chosen were a mistake. Yes. Because we can go
pop, pop, pop and take their regions
so much faster than they can get to our three. I also just
want to point out... They, I don't think, have a flight
out of Canberra right now. And we could steal a lot of
their money if we wanted. What if we invested
some extra money... we bought a flight,
and then we did the steal? They have more money
than us at the moment. Only question is,
do we want to dump budget? Sorry, I can't hear you. The only question is, do we want to dump
budget on something? We don't want to... We don't want to deposit,
but that flight. I'll check if that flight
is still the same price. You don't think
we want to deposit in case they steal? I mean, our balance is not
that much higher than theirs, but I guess let's think about whether we want to book a flight.
Because here's what I feel. I'm quite confident on
the Questacon challenge. I think I can do that.
Yeah. And I want as much
as possible to... It is only a 1.5x multiplier, which is a little annoying. It's not too much, but
at least the more we bet, the more we can earn on that. Yeah. Questacon doesn't have until 9. Yeah.
Which is an hour and a half. We can maybe do
the Vegemite until then. Okay. And then
Portrait Gallery opens at 10 if we want to do that. That sounds like a plan. Alright, well, let's
go decide about a flight. Alright. So this morning,
we could fly to Perth. The problem is we
don't necessarily have a great flight back from Perth. We could fly to Alice Springs. There is a good flight
to Alice Springs. Alternatively, we could go
for one of their territories right off the bat. The flights to Brisbane,
I think, are $400. The Sydney ones are almost free. Yeah. Wanna do Sydney
and then Brisbane? Because we do Sydney,
then they'll take it back, and we take it back again. Could do that, yeah. Okay, so it seems like we could book
that 2:15 flight via Melbourne to Adelaide for $640 for the both of us. Lock it up?
Yeah, let's book that. Okay, let's book it. Awesome, and the
good thing about Canberra is that it's not too big. So to get to the location
of these challenges is not actually going
to be too hard for us. Not hours of trains.
Well... Well, the only thing is,
it's all on foot, and the walking distances
are not nothing. If we want to do
the Vegemite challenge, we have to get to a
grocery store or something. Yeah.
And the closest one seems to be about a
20 minute walk away. I think we just start walking. Yeah.
Yeah. Here's the move. The flights to Sydney
are dirt cheap. So, what we're gonna do... is we're gonna put down
some more money here, we're gonna book a flight
to Sydney, and then, with our
relatively low balance, we're gonna attempt the steal. Yeah. We've bought that. That was $202. Okay, we're putting down
another $500 in Victoria. And then we're gonna
attempt the steal. Now... the question is, when do
we want to start this steal? Well, yeah,
because they, I think, are in the middle of
a challenge right now. Right. It's not totally clear to me,
but I think they are. If that is the case, I want to see
if they win the challenge. Right. Because then there would
be more money for us to take. The unpredictable... nature of nature and the fact we only have
10 minutes to complete this does make it quite
a risky challenge. And we said yesterday,
you know, we're going to be aware
of these risky challenges and not go crazy on them. Yeah. So I'm leaning towards
a more conservative bet. Look at this. Look at how many ants
are right here. That's a great anthill. Oh my god, actually,
look at that. Sam, if you stand there
too long, they're gonna bite you. I am stronger than ants. Before we commit to the steal, we're gonna go down
to the platform and just see how possible
it seems to actually do this. Now here's
something interesting. The end of the train has
two doors right next to each other. Okay. So if you line up
with the end, you would optimize your chances. It seems like
this yellow line here... Is the end of the train.
Is the end of the train. I think let's just observe. This seems... fairly consistent. The train is almost always
stopping right at that yellow line. Yeah. Here comes another train. Let's see. Once again, pretty consistent. Pretty consistent. Yeah, that one stops
a little further back, but... Yeah, it's usually
a little more that way... But we still
would have gotten it. I think, yeah,
maybe we just go for it. I actually think
this is kind of hard. Yeah, but I mean,
bugs love some Vegemite. Why are you saying that? I've never seen a bug
eating Vegemite. Well, have you offered
them Vegemite much? So how much
should we put down? I feel good about $500. Okay. You should film yourself
saying that to the camera. They can hear me.
Just in case you're wrong. I feel good about $500. I'm willing to lose $500. Let's do really good.
Let's take our time then. So are we staking that?
Lock it in. Yep. Alright. There is a great irony with... the fact that... the better— the faster they
complete this challenge and the more successfully
they complete this challenge, the better for us. Yeah, it's like I want
them to win the challenge and I want them to do it fast. Truly, this time,
unironically, good luck. Could get this. I don't want to have to walk. You just stepped
over some ants. Oh. They're actually
all in a line. Actually, this is a long line.
See this track? I feel like on one end of this,
there must be an anthill. Yeah, this is a little... We're following the trail – oh, okay – to the anthill.
(laughs) I was right. This is a pretty good anthill here. This is a good anthill
if we want big ants. They're just by a... I think by a grocery store. I think it's gotta be a challenge
that they bought groceries for. I mean, but we need to do— I mean, we can't cut getting
to the airport all that close. No, we don't want
to miss this flight. If we're going to do this... Again, we need to be
heading to the airport by about 8:45,
which is in 20 minutes. Yeah, I agree. So I think we
have to give them... really, ten more minutes
to update. Hurry it up, guys! How about, okay... Let's give ourselves
15 minutes to find smaller ants. Yeah, I'm happy to search. How about let's drop
our packs down for a second and kinda search this area? And I'm gonna have my snack.
(bag rustling) What is taking them so long?! Stop dilly dallying! Let's just wait
until the last second. I think the next train
that comes through here, we attempt the steal,
and it's just a question of... If they complete it.
If they've done it or not. Okay. It's a decent little hole now.
That's decent. Don't scare them.
Ants get scared quite easily. If you move something
that was in their trail, they'll run back into the hole. Yeah. Alright.
You ready? (sighs) Yeah. Yep, activate it. Okay. Activate? Yep, activate it.
Here we go. God, I hope this isn't
a different kind of train. Alright. Oh, it feels like
we're playing roulette. But these are
smaller doors, Ben. I don't think that they are. These are smaller doors.
Oh no. What if the spacing is different? Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop. Keep going, keep going,
keep going! It was a completely
different train. Completely different
design of train. Okay, it's fine. Let's get the hell out of here. Sam... Good news. Sounds like there's
been a failed steal. Wait, really?
Yeah. Heh.
(giggles) It had to have been the
train door one, right? Must be. (chuckles) Sorry. So they lost... $431 on that. Okay, they're probably
a bit upset right now, so say one nice thing for them. I'm sure you tried really hard. And that's what matters. That was tough. That was tough how that went. That was tough,
but you know what? That was tough
how that went down. We didn't lose that much. And we're still gonna
go on the offensive. I think next step
is to make the slurry. Make a paste that
is sugar and Vegemite and a little bit of water. Okay. Alright, you wanna
give that a taste and see if it seems like
the right amount? A taste? Ugggh! Really need to make
some money in Sydney. (snaps fingers) Why won't it let us
check in, Ben? I don't know. Having trouble checking in. Hi, it seems that we booked
at the wrong airport. Well, I wonder when
we can go to Sydney now. ♪ Sugar, sugar ♪
(humming) Oh, we should have
gotten honey. So it'd be $360 per person? For the 11. Okay, thank you. That's not good, Ben. No. We need to figure
out a new plan here. We need money. Yeah. Now, maybe we should... Would we be able to
make the Alice flight? Yeah, maybe. If we go to Qantas right now. I kinda think that is
maybe the move. Yeah, I think we
might have to go to Alice. Okay, let's go to the Qantas desk
and see about that. I think it might be
too soon to book. That flight leaves really soon. Okay, where's Qantas? Qantas is in the
other terminal, Ben. (bleep) It leaves in 40 minutes. I don't even think
it'll let us book it. Okay, I think we need to run. Alright, I think we're
pretty much good to go. I think so. Should we give
a tour of our trap? Let's give them a tour. Alright, so we've got
two variant... We've really got three
different ways of attacking it. So these are our two core traps,
and slightly different approaches. So this one is just the
Vegemite sugar water slurry, with a little bit put on the lips
to hopefully attract them. This one is the same thing, but we've put soap on the lip to hopefully help them slide down. And then once we get there, we're going to dump
this mix into the base as kind of a core moat
that hopefully traps them. So for them to get into
the main things, we've got... these ramps up to the main traps. We've also got
a trap-to-trap ramp in case they want to
make a break for it. A trapeze, if you will. Yeah, mhm. And then once we get there, we'll probably put some
sticks in the outside. I've got some sticks here to...
To give them natural incentive. But I reckon we're good to go. Here goes nothing. Sorry, little guys. (breathlessly) Oh god... Who do we talk to
to try to book a flight? We went to the wrong airport. We were supposed to
go to Avalon. So now we're trying
to pivot and get on the flight to Alice Springs
that leaves in 40 minutes, so it won't let us book. But usually at the gate, you can maybe book us
on a later one and then standby us
back onto it. Ah.
We've done this before. Yep. Do you guys have bags
to take here? Just these. Just on our backs.
Just those. So your flight is 40 minutes. So you should make it
for your flight. No, but we
don't have a ticket. We need to buy a ticket.
Yeah, yeah. Oh, you don't have a ticket.
Don't have a ticket. Well, yeah,
you need to buy a ticket. We can't— We don't
do the tickets here. You can't buy
tickets here at all? No, you can't buy tickets. Oh my gosh,
it's crawling up there. He's leaving? He's telling his friends. Oh there, he's coming on.
Oh, someone's already in. It's trapped. It's trapped.
He's in. He's in. We got it.
He's in. We can confirm that
he doesn't leave, but I think— Woah, he's swimming. He's swimming. How is he... Sam, he's swimming. He's an aqua ant. He's out. He's coming out. He's out, he's out of the water.
Oh no. Oh no. He's out of the water. Oh no. Wait, is he though? No, he's... Is he?
I hate this. I hate what we've done. We can free him. He's had a nice little meal. I reckon he's trapped. Adam Chase. I'm on hold. He said he had five minutes
to get it done, so... (giggles despondently)
Oh god. If we don't get this flight,
we're in huge trouble. I think he's officially trapped. I think if we free him now,
he'll survive. Okay. Quickly, free him. Yes, okay. Here, can you take the camera?
Go, cut. I'm not sure what happened. The hold music stopped,
but he's not back. So I'm not sure. What is it? Well, there was hold music,
but then it stopped. But now he isn't there yet. Okay, alright, of course. Yes! Thank you so much.
Thank you. Sorted?
Yes, we did it. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Okay. Okay. That was nuts. Okay, Adam. Yes?
So... Having been kneecapped by fate,
and our own ignorance... We are no longer going
on the offensive. We are instead being forced
to retreat into the outback. It's true. Where we will grow
more powerful than ever before. It's sort of a Dune situation. It is sort of a Dune situation. We're going into the desert
to amass power after a setback. The desert power.
So then... Yeah, we're cultivating
desert power, Ben. And then tomorrow,
we will strike. And we will burn their whole
territory to the ground. You want the water? We could keep that.
Nothing bad happened. It's a little Vegemite-y. I changed my mind. Okay, let's go to Questacon. So, they currently hold
Victoria pretty thoroughly, Tasmania very thoroughly. They really weakly hold
South Australia. We'll go there, we'll claim that. Yeah. So, the question is,
what is their fourth region? Kind of, the question really is, where are they going now
and competing for? We are going to go
to the outback. We are going to amass our power, and tomorrow, we will strike. And because their territory... all of those regions are together...
Highly vulnerable, in my opinion. ...it will be super easy to steal
all of their stuff tomorrow. Yep, right at the end. That's the move, baby. This way. Alright, we're in Questacon. First of all, great name. I don't know what it means. Love the name. What do we want to stake? You're good at science, yeah? I don't know. My only worry with this is the slang quiz that
Amy did yesterday was a little bit on the harder end? Amy can be a little bit tricky. What's the most
you're willing to lose? $1,250, I think. Okay, let's do $1,250. Alright, I'm happy with that. Yep.
Okay. Lock it in.
Lock it in. Oh, there's a big moon. Wow. Alright, here's gallery one. Oh, yeah. You can see the electric flow. Yeah, yeah. Bigger ball, bigger boost, yeah. It's like Jupiter. (cyclical buzzing) It's good stuff. We're gonna make it. I actually think that
if we play this right, and we're able to
earn money in Alice... Yeah. We can win. Alright, I want to
test my reaction speed. Go! (clang) Where'd it go? (clanging) I don't know. Take your Instagram shots in here. This set of letters seems random, but it's actually important
in astronomy. But there's an acronym
that I learned at uni to remember them,
and that was: ""Oh be a fine girl, kiss me."" ♪ Hydrogen, helium,
lithium, beryllium ♪ ♪ Boron, carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen ♪ ♪ Fluorine, neon,
sodium, magnesium ♪ ♪ Alumin— ♪ That's not a liquid.
Remember that. This is the Nobel Prize. This is Brian Schmidt's prize
that he got in 2011. He was the vice-chancellor
of ANU when I was there. So he learned that the universe's expansion
is accelerating. Yes, by looking at supernovas. Get ready for our test. I think I'm ready. I think, as ready as we can be in the amount of time that
we want to spend here. Let's find a good spot
to go do the quiz. Alright. Amy, I hope
you've been nice to us. Hope you had fun
at Questacon. But more importantly, I hope
you were paying attention. I'm going to give you
five questions, all of which have answers
that were inside Questacon. You can pick three of
those questions to answer. You have to get all of the
three questions correct. Also, shout out to
Tom at Questacon for helping me write these.
Tom, you are amazing. Question one is: Whose Nobel Prize is
on display at Questacon and what is it for? Well, you know this. Brian Schmidt's prize
that he got in 2011. Question two: What is the minimum
number of moves required to complete the Tower of Brahma
with four discs? Is it A) 9 moves, B) 13 moves, C) 15 moves, or D) 17 moves? I have no idea what this is. That was in that
first room at the top. That was those puzzle games. I didn't really look at them. Oh, yeah. You can see the electric flow. Well, hopefully
we don't need this one. I don't even know
what the Tower of Brahma is. I have no idea. Question three: What is the current visitor record on the Speed Ball
exhibit in Excite@Q, and when was it set? I don't know. I know it was that— It was in the jump room,
you know? And there was a thing,
and I did look at it. But I didn't really memorise it. Okay, let's hope
for the last two. Question four— Why are there two airports
in Melbourne? That seems silly. Someone should've
told us about that. Yeah.
Or we probably should've— I should have remembered that. Probably should have, yeah. Nonetheless, this is
now an even better plan. This is— Because it's—
We're doing Dune. Uh-huh, we're doing Dune. We're Dune-ing it. And, I... We're gonna Dune it to them. I haven't finished
that trilogy of films, 'cause they haven't
made the last one. But as far as I know,
it only goes well... Right, everything goes good. For... all.
Everyone, yeah. Come forward.
Yes, thank you. Look. Here's the thing
about gate agents. And I'll go ahead and
tell you right now. The gate agents' first reaction
is always, ""I can't help you."" And then... if you just talk to them
for two minutes, then they always
figure out a way to do exactly what you were hoping. Because I think
the thing is that most people are
very, very mean to the agents. And so if you prove that
you're nice, then... You know, they let you through. Kind of like, you know,
like trolls under a bridge. I guess that's mean. Yeah, well...
But we're not mean to them. But also usually the troll
doesn't let you through if you're nice to them.
You have to answer their riddles. What is the name
of the machine you would use to generate static electricity? A) a Wimshurst machine, B) a Gravitram machine, C) a Harmonograph, or D) the Kraken? Do you know? No. (exhales loudly) The questions are not
the kind of questions I thought they would ask. No, they are the
weirdly specific ones. I thought they would
ask about science facts. The science, yeah. I didn't think they'd
ask about the exhibits. Ugh, okay,
let's see the last one. Oh my god. Question five, this one is
not multiple choice. You just gotta give me
the right answer. What are the
three types of bees in a European bee colony? Oh... queen... drone... and worker, I think? I studied that one a good bit. Mhm, yeah, I saw you
at the bee exhibit. So I think we're
feeling good about two, and we need a third one. Speed Ball, that— I mean, that's just gonna be
a pure guess, right? This one, that's— Is that just gonna be
a pure guess? Okay, I'm gonna check
the last one. Oh my god. Tower of Brahma
with four discs. I don't even remember this. What could that be? Four discs. If Tower of Brahma
means Tower of Hanoi, I actually know what
Tower of Hanoi is. It's that kid's toy with the discs. I think it is that. You could work it out. We could... We could try to work it out. I'm making four different
sized pieces of paper. That's the large one. That's the next size. The next one is half
the size of that. And then just a little... While Toby and I solve
our Tower of Hanoi, quick clarification time. The Tower of Hanoi, also
known as the Tower of Brahma, is a game with three rods
and some number of discs. The goal is to transport
a stack of discs from one rod to another,
going one move at a time and never stacking a larger disc
on a smaller disc. Amy wants to know what
the fewest number of steps to do this for four discs is. And after some trial and error, Toby and I managed
to do it in 17. 16.
16, 17. But I don't think that was
the most efficient. Four. And all we could do is
put this back where it came from, but that doesn't make sense. One. That's our fourth move. This isn't... No, I think I went in a circle. Do at least something
that feels wrong. 2⁴ is 16, which is
not really helpful either. 15, 16, 17, 18. So now we're at 18. That's not right. We're getting worse. We don't have an
enormous amount of time, so... Yeah. We managed
to do 17 and we're not even 100% sure
on the rules of the game. I agree that
it shouldn't be that easy. So it shouldn't be 17. So I think I would go 15
and hope for the best. And if it's actually 17,
I will die. Because that is so embarrassing. So we're saying, we know
the Nobel Prize one. Brian Schmidt, Physics, 2011. We're saying the bees are
queen, worker, drone. And this one,
we're gonna guess 15? Yeah. Should we lock that in? Yeah..? Here are your answers. The answer to the first question
about the Nobel Prize is A)
Brian P. Schmidt for physics. The answer to
the second question about the Tower of Brahma is C) 15 moves. (gasps) (shudders) (both sob) Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait. Check the bees, fam.
Check the bees. Yes, yes. Question five. The three types of bees in
a European bee colony are the queen bee,
worker bees, and drones. (sighs)
Yes! I cannot believe we made it
out of that unscathed. Wait, wait, wait. Not only do we not even
know what the game is, we don't even know
the word for the game. I can't believe
we only got 500 bucks for all that trouble. You want some interesting news? Oh yeah? I think they're
heading to Adelaide. They're heading to Adelaide? Kinda looks like it. Hello. Well, we're on our flight
to Alice Springs. But somewhat surprisingly,
we're also... in The Snack Zone, baby! I didn't realize it was
on the way to Alice Springs, but it turns out The Snack Zone's
right on the way. The Snack Zone
was right on the way. Today we'll be reviewing these
beef sausage rolls, which... in— on American
short domestic flights, you don't get hot food. Nothing close to real food. This is pretty crazy. That tastes like actual food. And actual food tastes so good. Right now, it really does. Are they at the airport? The tracker is somewhere in between
Melbourne and Adelaide. Okay, if we want to do
portrait gallery... Oh yeah, let's go in and out. We only need to quickly see it
and then draw a picture. Make a recognizable portrait
at the National Portrait Gallery. Create your own version of a portrait in the
National Portrait Gallery. The portrait may not
have words in it. Create a Google form with
the photo and the question ""Who is this a drawing of?"" The correct answer
must be in the top two. You may disregard
obvious joke answers. Let's just swoop in and then do
the challenge at the airport. We would need to
stake it ahead of time, but I just want to make sure
we don't miss our flight. So here's my question. Have you been to this
portrait gallery? Yeah. Okay, and you feel
really confident that there's someone
universally known? Well, to be honest, I'm shocked that you didn't
know who Ned Kelly was. Because I think he's
probably the number one easiest to draw and most iconic
if they have him there. But, keep in mind that
the respondents are just gonna be random Twitter people
not from Australia. The late Queen Elizabeth... is obviously quite easy. I think the Queen
would be easy if you're confident that
the Queen would be in there. Oh yeah, I'm 100% sure of it. Okay, if you're
confident about that. But I think Ned Kelly
would be better. I have no idea
who Ned Kelly is. He was the guy
who wears a tin bucket with a slit in it. Okay, I kinda get that,
but I'm sorry to break it to you, but I think this might just
be an Australian thing. So I'm not feeling tremendously
confident about this. I'd also worry about, you know, people who are
pro-Ben and Adam purposefully spiking it. I think Ned Kelly is
less likely to get sabotaged. I have no idea who that is! What about $750? $750? Stake it, $750?
$750? We'll lock it in.
Morning. Are you going
into the galleries? Yes.
Yes. Just the backpacks,
put them in a locker. Okay.
Oh, sure. Okay.
Alright. It says video recording
is not permitted. So, let's go through. We'll take a photo. And we'll report back
to the audience. This is absolutely
incredible, Ben. What's happening? Look, you gotta— The game keeps you on your toes. (laughs) That's for sure. Okay, we left
the portrait gallery. That didn't go amazing. And now we also have
another issue where there's no way
to buy bus tickets. And we need to get
to the airport. We don't have a bus card. We can't pay with
our credit cards. We're thinking of
walking 40 minutes, begging at the bus, or I just
thought of these scooters. Yeah, the problem is there's
nowhere within a 30 minute walk to even buy a bus card. While we do that,
I'll quickly summarize what happened at the
Portrait Gallery. All the portraits were
weirdly niche. There was no Queen.
There was... The most recognizable
person I saw was Russell Crowe,
but that's pretty hard to do through the photo—
the portrait. But for now, we're just
getting to the airport, and then we're gonna worry
about the rest of this challenge once we get there, right? Do you think
we can safely do this? Eh, okay.
I mean, there's helmets. Good bye. Oh, yours is slower? Alright, scooter mission complete. I'll go get tickets
while you lock those. That was, once again... a little tight for comfort. Okay, we have about
ten minutes until our bus. Alright, let's sit down over here. Yeah. Okay. A lot of things
happening at once. 'Cause the other thing
I was noticing is... Ben and Adam's pins... are updating. You notice where
that's a line between? That's Melbourne and... an undisclosed location
north of South Australia. And on the way to...? Alice Springs. I think they're
going to Alice Springs. They wouldn't. I... Welcome to the outback. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Timothy Chalamet, is that you? It's me, Timothy Chalamet! I'm the Lisan al-Ghaib! And you could be the
Lisan al-Ghaib if you got a subscription
to Nebula because you could
watch the next episode of Jet Lag: The Game where we go to Alice Springs,
and we do Dune right now on Nebula. That episode is up—
We're going to the outback. We're going to the outback, baby. (bleep) these Jet Lag hats, which you can buy for... an amount of money on Nebula. Do you think there
are any legal implications for saying that we're
""doing Dune""? Nope.
Probably. Let's hope not. Alright. Anyway. Well, if you want to
help support our legal fees... You can go ahead
and sign up... for Nebula. And why should they do that? Well, you can— Because they can watch Dune. No. Dune is really not on Nebula.
It's not available. You know what it is on Nebula? A bunch of video essays
about Dune! And also, the Layover podcast, which is our aftershow podcast where we break down
what went on, what went on behind the scenes, all the stupid mistakes we've made. We talk to Toby. It's the number one
Toby-talks-about-this-show podcast. So, it's on Nebula. And Nebula's got a bunch
of other great stuff too. Not only, of course, every episode of Jet Lag
one week early, the Layover podcast, our outtakes from each season that
we put at the end of the season, our pilot season of Jet Lag, but it's got actually other things
from other people that aren't us, such as Patrick Willems's
debut movie, and also an upcoming short film. Abigail Thorn's play, and
also a film that she's doing. Jesse Gender's film
Identiteaze. Also, Archeology Quest,
and also The Battle for Britain, and also Modern Conflicts, and also Broey Deschanel's
Taboo on Screen, and also other series. But I can't remember
all of them right now because there's so many of them! And maybe an upcoming Original where Nebula gave us
too much money to make a show where we kind of
manipulate our friends. If you want to sign up
for Nebula, we got a pretty good deal for you. Sort of, you're turning
into Larry David now. Yeah, not bad. A pretty, pretty good deal. If you go to nebula.tv/jetlag, because that's where
you can get 40% off. And 40% off,
that's $30 a year or so. That's not many dollars. $2.50 a month, $2.50 a month! $2.50 a month,
not bad, not bad. And that's to get
next episode of Jet Lag early, Layover podcasts, all that
other exclusive stuff. And help support, like,
you keep these lights on. These lights are expensive. These, specifically,
these lights are on because of your subscriptions,
that's true. It actually kind of
genuinely is, yeah. Oh yeah, that's a nice joke. This is the studio, yeah. It'd be— These ad reads would
be terrible without lights. That's true, you wouldn't
be able to see anything. Yeah, so anyways, go to
nebula.tv/jetlag to sign up and thanks in advance
for your support. (smooch) Well, that was really tender. Well, I'm tender
with our audience."

Carbon offset by the Gold Standard: https://registry.goldstandard.org/credit-blocks/details/432512","JPj_Kf5jC_0","Hello and welcome
to episode three of Jet Lag: Australia. Right now, the board
looks like this, and the teams are here. As a reminder,
the team that controls more of Australia's eight regions
at the end of four days will win. Teams control regions by
depositing money in them, but teams also have
to spend that money to travel between the regions. And they can earn more money
by gambling on challenges. Well, unless they lose
the challenge, in which case they lose money. Which brings us to this episode. Right now, both teams
have made big bets on high-risk challenges. After losing almost all of
their money last episode, Ben and Adam need to
win this challenge where they've predicted
how many people will visit a fruit stand in
Adelaide's Central Market. They need at least
twelve customers, and with only three minutes left,
they're only at nine. Toby and I, meanwhile, have to flip a bottle
and land on its lid. Which so far
we've struggled to do. We've got one last attempt before we fail
and lose our $500 bet. Well... Okay, there's
a new guy in here. Come on, we just need
three more. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You want to buy
those vegetables right now. Come on, go to
the cash register. Okay, he's ready to buy, right? No? No, he's going back. They're buying.
They're buying. Here we go. I'm in a complete panic. This is ten.
Oh, this is two! This is two. Okay. Ten and eleven.
Ten and eleven. We just need one more. Oh, this guy's in line now. Oh no, he left. I'm just gonna
do some observing. We only have
a minute and a half. (gargles mic) Oh, here he goes! Yes! Oh no, he's going back
to get more stuff. Oh, okay. No, no.
It's okay, it's okay. That's twelve.
That's twelve. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. That's thirteen. Challenge complete. Here's what I'll say, Toby. You remember how
we said yesterday, we need to double down
on confidence and not chase long shots? Yeah? I think we violated that
with this challenge. So far, we've done great
when we're confident. We've done terribly
when we're not and we do long shots. We need to stop it.
We need to calm down. And we need to recalibrate
our confidence. Only doing things we're
sure on from here on out. Yes. Alright, let's go to Sydney. I kinda feel like that was the first moment that
we just properly misplayed. I'm pretty upset
at the moment. Ugh! Look, we did it.
We did it. We did it. Thank god. We got it.
Thank god. Now we've got a little
bit of capital to work with. Okay, let's leave this place. Let's decide what to do next. Okay, here we go.
(whines) We need to
burn into our brains: Just because we can
do a challenge, doesn't mean that we should.
Doesn't mean we should. Yeah. We've learned our lesson
on day two. Yes. It's less than
two hours into day two. And here's the thing,
we've learned lessons. I don't know if
Ben and Adam have. Hopefully they start
learning lessons now. Maybe they haven't learned
any lessons yet. Yeah. Look what we found. I think we're— I think
we have to celebrate by buying these hats. Yeah, celebrate from
clawing our way back from the depths of hell. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Now, I feel like
we've transcended to our... We're in a lot
better place now. Mentally, spiritually. As far as accessories go. Hello. Hello, okay. So, here is my assessment of the situation we're in. I don't think that it's
going to be possible to make enough money
in Adelaide to put down an amount that is really going to
deter them from coming here. No, I think that dream
is pretty much dead. We would have to stay here
until tomorrow. Yeah. And I don't think
we want to do that. Here, I think,
are really our options. I think we should go
to Melbourne. I agree, and we
should go to Melbourne before they go to Melbourne. I think that they're
on a flight right now, and I think that flight's to Sydney. I'm not positive,
but I think that that's right. As Toby and I flew to Sydney, where, as a reminder, our plan is to knock out
some challenges before taking a bus to the
Australian Capital Territory, Ben and Adam made a plan to
fly to Melbourne at 1:50 pm. With the time before the flight, they wanted to do the
Wine Centre steal, but their bus to the
Wine Centre never came, making their only option
to earn more money the Face Tim Tam,
on which they wagered $300. Alright, where do you want
to attempt the Face Tim Tam? I think you're gonna do it, because you have a
larger and flatter face. We have assessed the
geometry of each of our faces, and I think I will
have an advantage. There's flat steps here. I mean, would it be helpful for me to show you
an image of yourself? That could be helpful. It's already kind of
melty on my fingies. Good. I actually think that's the key.
Alright, so I think— Just be nice and
careful and deliberate. Oh, your forehead is
fully covered in chocolate. This is my intention. I actually think this is
the riskiest part, and I'm gonna let it
melt down my nose. Oh, this is
really precarious now. Seems really dangerous
at the moment. It seems like it could
flip over the other way. You need to get it all the way
on that side of your face. Yeah, yeah, I see it. Once I get the tongue in play. Yeah. I think this is the
most dangerous part. I think you're doing
really good. You did it, you did it. Wow! Wow, that was incredible. (full mouth)
Victory! Let's go to the airport. I am ready to get
the hell out of here. It's so hot. Hey Ben,
here's a question for you. (rapping)
♪ How low can you go? ♪ ♪ Can you go down low? ♪ I can't really go down
♪ All the way to the flo'? ♪ ...that much lower. ♪ How low can you go? ♪ This low.
Ben! Have they landed somewhere yet? For god's sake? Welcome back. Oh wow, the camera
really does not like the refresh rate of these lights. Well anyway,
let's get to the train, get to Circular Quay,
check out the challenges. Looks like they
lost one challenge, won two. They're up to about $2,000.
That's still a lucky thing on this. And it looked like
they were heading to the airport, which means... they could be trying to
go to that Perth flight. It'd be a little bit tight,
but if they... They could be, but we'll learn soon. If they are going to Perth,
that's our chance to swoop in. I think so. Not mess things up if
we have that opportunity. Yeah. It opens up a
strategic lane, basically. Let's go. Back at the airport. We we're having trouble
booking our flight. So once again, we're gonna
go talk to a gate agent. Here's the only other thing
I would mention... is that we're paying
a really stupid amount to go to Melbourne,
which should be cheap to get to. Yeah. You could argue that
we should go to Perth. This is true. Those flights to Perth are,
what, two grand? Yeah. We would have to see
how much money we have. I think we might
actually have enough. We can look. We have $1,964. I actually think
there is a Perth flight that we could take
for that much. $1,906 to Perth. It's not the craziest idea, Ben. And it would be in an hour. We could get on it right away. I kinda think
we should do that. It's not bad. I think we
should do that, Ben. Because that way
we're actually— That makes sense! Go to Perth now, knock it out. This is an amount that makes
sense to pay to go to Perth. We shouldn't spend $1,300
to go to Melbourne. No, that's true. We can definitely get to
Melbourne for cheaper later. Let's do this! We have to hurry if we're
going to book this flight. Well, let's go. I really hope Ben and Adam... get on that flight to Perth today. They will certainly
get on that flight. I think it's very likely,
knowing them. And I think that is
one of our best opportunities. Let's book it. Let's book it. Okay, here we go. 'Cause booking's gonna
close in a few minutes. Oh my god.
What if it times out? You got it, you got it. Come on, baby. (bleep) There's an error. Okay, we need to try to
talk to a gate agent. Hi, we were trying
to book last minute on the 1:20 to Perth,
but then it wouldn't work. Trying to—
We're trying to buy a ticket. Yes ma'am. I don't think we can—
We can't do that. Yeah, unfortunately not. Thank you though. Oh, that sucks. We couldn't get
on the Perth flight. It's too soon, too expensive. Just gotta figure out a
way to get to Melbourne. There's a Qantas flight
to Melbourne at 1:50. It seems to say that
it's sold out, but they might still have tickets. Let's go try. (groans) Let's go to the Qantas desk. Oh, that's a big boy. This is our stop. It's a big boy. Big boy indeed. So... It seems like Ben and Adam are
at the airport in Adelaide, but they haven't...
booked a flight. We absolutely cannot
make sense of this. I kinda wonder if
they're just having trouble getting out of there,
and I don't know why. Yeah, I wonder
if it's a budget issue. Some other kind of issue. Their behaviour is definitely
throwing us for a bit of a spin. Yes.
Yeah, it's concerning when you can't understand
what your opponent is doing. Yeah, I mean
that usually means either something quite
good for you is happening, or something quite bad
for you is happening. Or we're
missing something big. Things are all falling apart. We should have just
booked earlier! We were just trying to book
on the 1:50 pm to Melbourne. It seemed to be sold out
right at the last minute. We were just seeing if
there happened to still be any seats available on that? It's too late to book that? Okay.
Okay. Great, thank you.
Thank you very much. Okay, now everything's
(bleep)-ed up again. The other one's gone. The cheaper, later one
is gone now. The 5:40's gone?
Yeah. Oy vey. I don't understand
what the hell is happening. Yeah, these flights are
just dropping like flies. Hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold on, I think
I've got the 1:50. I have five minutes to book it,
or it's gonna close out. Alright, good luck. (rustling) Got it. You got it?
Yeah. Today, Adelaide
to Melbourne, $1,300. That's real? Seems to be real. How'd you get it?
I don't know. I just went to the Qantas website. Seems to want us to
check in at the airport, so let's do that. Anyway, let's get to the steps and generate new challenges. We have about
two and a half hours until the last train—
or the last bus we could take out of here. Oh yeah, so we should
move pretty fast. Yeah.
Let's get those challenges up. The cruise ship has
a carnival ride on that thing. What's that little thing
at the very top? The cruise ship
sees something he likes. Maybe there's
a sister ship off the— Oh wait, no, not sister.
Maybe there's a... ...a cousin?
No, it's not allowed. Alright, welcome back. Should we take a look
at the challenges? Yes, what do we got? Number one, ooh.
30% steal. Throw a democracy
sausage into a bun. We get five attempts. Interesting. Number two, also a steal. 50% steal. Successfully throw
and catch a boomerang. We don't love our hand-eye
coordination challenges so far, so I don't feel like
those are great. Number three, though,
is a 2x multiplier, and it's an Australian slang quiz. Okay. You probably have the
best knowledge of anyone about Australian slang. Oh, surely, surely
I must be able to. So we probably—
And you've lived here. That means you have the
bare minimum slang knowledge. Hopefully, but
we definitely have an advantage over them on that. And then the last one,
3.5x multiplier, but it's surfing at
Manly or Bondi Beach. Dead. We're both dead. We don't have time
for that anyway, so... Well, we definitely want
to do the slang quiz. Slang quiz sounds good, and... But the question is,
would we want to attempt any of the steals? Or would we just want to
get to Canberra sooner? I think I would rather
get to Canberra earlier and generate challenges there. What did we just learn
about challenges like this? Yeah, long shot challenges. Technically we can do
the quiz wherever. Most of the bus to Canberra is in New South Wales,
if you wanted. Yeah, so we could
literally do it on the bus. Okay.
So let's figure out what the fastest way
to Canberra is, and then get to that. Well that was
a giant rigmarole to do what we were planning
on doing the whole time. We're back. I think we managed to
book the original flight. We just need to check in. Oh, it cost so much. It was $1,300 total.
(giggles) Unbelievable. Yeah.
One way. I know, but we
have to get there fast. Unfortunately,
we don't have time. Thank you so much. Gate 22 after security. Thank you. Well, we've successfully paid an outrageous amount of money (giggles)
...to go to Melbourne. I wouldn't call it a win,
but at this point... I'll take anything.
At this point, I'll take it. Okay, there's only
one Greyhound left, and it's too late. So... Murray's, I think,
is probably more frequent. Mhm. So we could make
the 2... the 2 pm. Does that make sense?
Okay. I think that makes sense.
Yeah. Well, let me do that. Oh, wait. They're sold out. Oh my god. How many of them
are sold out? It's booked until 4 pm. That's not great. (murmurs) Hmm. Let's get in the shade
and decide what to do. Can we call Murray's
and just check— double check? 'Cause if there's any way
they can squeeze us on, that would be amazing. I mean, we could just
head to Central Station now and see if we can—
They have an office there, Murray's office in Central.
Yeah. I'm not seeing
any on Murray's. Were you seeing some at all? Yeah, the short 4 pm
was showing available for me. Mine is not showing any. Maybe it just got bought. Requested seats are
no longer available. This is not great. Well, we might have to rethink
the plan for the rest of the day. Okay...? We should've booked it earlier. Yep. We're headed to Melbourne. We're gonna get the
Melbourne bonus. Unless something insane happens. Now we have to decide
how much money to put in Adelaide, and I frankly think it's one dollar. Yeah, I just don't think
that we can put down an amount of money that's
gonna deter them anyway. So we might as well
keep it and use it for now. Even with the welcome bonus... if we were to start off
in Melbourne with under $1,000, I would find that very precarious. We found today that... that was a very bad spot
to be in. Yeah, I think that we're... We kind of need every dollar
in our wallet right now. Well, except for the one dollar
that we're gonna put down here. We don't need that dollar.
Yep, alright. Let's put one dollar
in South Australia. Okay, they deposited
a dollar in Adelaide. Okay, one dollar
in South Australia. I guess they think
we're not going there. That means that
we are currently in control of South Australia. They do—
They could come here and put down two dollars
and claim it, but they gotta make their way
all the way over here. They have to get here,
and that's annoying. I think there's a good chance
that they're gonna steal it from us. Our grip on it is
quite literally as weak as it possibly could be,
but who knows? Maybe they'll just ignore it
for the rest of the game. Well, here's a thing. What do you got? We can get to Adelaide
for $249. Oh! (chortles)
We know... that they only left a dollar. And they've just left. Sam, we have to go
to Adelaide. I think that might be it.
Oh my god. I love that. 'Cause they're
probably thinking that we wouldn't go there
'cause it's too out of our way. Yes. But... The best thing in this game
is to be travelling behind someone. It wastes the maximum
amount of their time. If they want it, they're
gonna have to come here, and that'll be a
whole hassle for them. I think that's the key. And hopefully we can... we can do a little better
in Victoria and... secure that nice and good. So... what do you think? Should we plan on kinda
finishing the day in Adelaide and doing that quiz? Yeah. I don't see a better— Let's sit down. We have time. Let's sit down and be sure. Okay. So, we need to pick
four regions at this point. You know, we've already
picked Queensland. We've already picked
New South Wales. And I think
it makes sense to do Capital Territory
and/or South Australia because we think that they're
going to Melbourne now. Yeah. The one dollar on Adelaide
means one of two things. Either they know
they're going back, and they didn't want
to waste money now, or they think
we're never going there. It's hard to know
what they're thinking. While we're on
our way over here, a baby pointed at me
and said, ""Kookaburra"". Which, I don't see it. Put up a picture of
a kookaburra. I don't see it. That's not accurate. Right? So, let me summarize
the options. So, basically we've decided
we either want to go to Canberra next or Adelaide next, followed by the opposite. The only question is,
which order do we do? Yeah. I'm starting to think that even though the flight
to Adelaide is cheaper, it makes more sense to
go to Canberra first so that we can get
the welcome bonus. Because we know they
will not beat us there. Considering that... we can effectively
pay for our flight, minus a little bit,
with the welcome bonus, get there, and then as of now, there's a really cheap option with
a quick connection in Melbourne to get to Adelaide tomorrow. We can go there and potentially
lock it up with just $2. If we're going the opposite way, I worry they get to the
Capital Territory first and claim the welcome bonus. Which not only is
$750 less for us, it's $750 more for them. I think I lean towards Canberra first. Yeah, it's tough because
we were so excited on the train to find that Adelaide option. And I hate to give
you all watching whiplash. Let's go to Canberra,
then go to Adelaide. And hopefully, from Adelaide, there'll be cheap flights
back to Melbourne or Sydney. Let's look into booking
that Canberra flight. Well, the 3:35 is a
little cheaper than the 4, but that would be a little tight. There's no reason
we can't go right now. Okay, well let's—
We'd have to go right now. So this is
an interesting thing in Australia
I've never seen before, is you board from
two different sides of the plane. It's actually kinda smart. Yeah. They seem to board
their planes and... 'Cause they— we also got
let off in two different places. Yeah. It seems to be just much faster.
Seems to work well though. I don't know. Learn. Learn from Australia,
the rest of the world. Alright. Back again. What was that, 90 minutes
in the airplane? Okay. Made it through security. We got about... 20 minutes till boarding. Let's do the quiz. How much do we
want to stake? Okay, we're feeling
fairly confident. And is this
a broken confidence like the other
confidence we had? Or is this a true,
genuine confidence? I mean... At the very least,
we know that we can do this better than Ben and Adam.
Yeah. Because you're from here.
I've lived here. We do know we're gonna
get $750 when we land there. $500.
I'm fine with $500. I could do $600.
I could be $600. You wanna do $600?
Could do $600. Let's do $600, okay. Oh my god. Do we do crowd think?
I think we do crowd think. I think we avoid pushing each other
I think we do. to make potentially bad decisions.
Okay, lock it in, $600? Should we do it?
Yeah. Oh hi, Amy. G'day mates,
how are we going? I'm not sticking with my
terrible Australian accent, but welcome to your
Australian slang quiz. I've got four multiple choice
questions for you, and one matching question. You can get one
multiple choice wrong, or miss one of the matching terms
before I void your contract. Question one,
what is a 'bloody ripper'? Is it A)
a car that's speeding, B) something that's really great, C) a hot dog with ketchup, or D) a wave that's
really hard to surf? Oh, it's B. Yeah, it's gonna be B. Let me just rule everything out. Speeding car, no. Hot dog and ketchup, no. You should— I'm sure it's B. I'm quite sure it's B.
Go with B. A bloody ripper is... B) something that's really great.
Yes. On to question two. What is a 'budgie smuggler'? Is it A) a small Australian rodent,
Oh, I know that.
We know this. B) a fanny pack, C) a speedo, Or D) a government official
who handles taxes? We're doing speedo? Yeah, let me just read them. Do-do-do-do-do-doot. I know it's a speedo.
Yeah, it's a speedo. A budgie smuggler is a speedo. Alright, question three. What does it mean
to 'shout' something? Is it A) to clean it, B) to throw it, C) to recommend it, or D)
to buy it for someone? It's to buy it for someone. It's like, you shout someone a beer. I'm sure of that. Okay, I wasn't as sure.
So I'm glad you know that. No, I'm 100% sure
that it's like, if I shout you a beer,
it's like I buy it. If you're sure of it,
great, let's do it. D?
D. To shout something is... to buy it for someone else. There we go.
Need one more. For question four,
I'm gonna say something to you, and you need to pick the option that would be an appropriate
response to what I've said. So here we go.
Oh, so advanced. So, I'm an ambo,
and a bit of a battler, and I almost chucked
a sickie last night, but I didn't, and it
was completely chockers. What would be an appropriate
response to that statement? A) ""You absolute servo"", B) ""Tockies!"", C) ""Hard yakka, mate"", or D)
""Sounds like a crazy arvo!""? ""So I'm an ambo"",
so an ambulance worker. ""And a bit of a battler, and
I almost chucked a sickie."" So, called in sick
when you're not really sick. ""But I didn't, and then it
was completely chockers."" So she went to work, and it was really full
of people at work. Yep.
So, they're set. It could be
C) ""Hard yakka, mate."" As in, you did hard work. It could also be
""Sounds like a crazy arvo"", because it was
a crazy arvo at work. Doesn't that mean afternoon? Yeah.
But... Last night.
So I don't think it's that. That's a good way
to rule that out. What is ""tockies""? I don't know ""tockies"". And ""absolute servo"" could
also work because it's like... No, because servo
means service station, like where you get gas.
Oh, yeah. It must be C. Should we lock in C?
C. The correct answer is C) Hard yakka, mate. We got it. Alright, your
last question is matching. I'm going to put
five slang terms and seven definitions
on the screen. You have to match
the correct term to the correct definition. If you got all the
multiple choice right, you can get one of these wrong
before I void your contract. Wait.
Oh, so we still have to get all of them right
except one on this. Oh boy, okay. Okay.
Porky. A lie. Ken oath. I don't know
what 'ken oath' means, but 'oath' on its own
would mean like, ""yeah"", like ""so true"". Shonky means poorly made. Galah... might be an idiot. And 'hooroo'
I've never heard before. Oh boy. I'm pretty sure with
the other four though, so... It's just hooroo.
'Ho-roo'? 'Hoo roo'. I feel like it could be
'good bye'. But honestly I don't think
I've ever heard that, have you? No. Hooroo? Have you ruled out 'snobby'? Oh, you know what? Like, ""he's a bit hooroo,""
you know? Oh.
That kind of sounds right. Hooroo. Hooroo. I feel pretty good
about that, between those three. If you have no idea. Should we lock it in? Here are the answers
for the matching. A porky is a lie. Got that. Saying ""ken oath""
is like saying ""that's so true"". Shonky is an adjective
describing something poorly made.
Okay. Galah is an idiot. And hooroo is goodbye. Oh, but we got it.
So hopefully you did well. We still got it.
Hop you guys are having fun. Hooroo. We got it, Sam. (sighs) That's a little
close for comfort. (softly)
Take a breath. We made it. Okay. Hooroo. Oh no, you know what,
now that she says that. I mean, in that intonation. Yeah, in that intonation. That's great.
That's great news for us. That was harder
than I was expecting. Look at that budget. That's a nice little budget. Alright, let's go on the flight. Here's what I
have to say to you. Let's boogie. Let's boogie. Welcome to Victoria. Alright, so,
we need to go board, but based on that,
we have $1,243. Do we want to pop
some money down here? I lean towards yes. Let me check out
the current standings. We've put already some on here. Yeah, we have $400,
so we could, you know... I could put personally
like $750 or so. And I think that
would be a big thing to dissuade them from coming. Could you truly dissuade
someone from coming to Sydney, a pinnacle point in
this game we are playing? I feel good about $750. I think that gives
a hefty amount that they have to beat. Yeah, let's do $750. Okay, lock it in? Yep.
Great. Alright, let's get on our flight. Welcome to the
city of Melbourne in the state of Victoria. So it looks like they're
at the airport in Sydney. They put down some
more money in Sydney, but not a crazy amount. Now, I—
I think that that was... kind of dumb to go
all the way back to Sydney just to put down, what, an additional like
700-something dollars? I saw that on the plane,
and I was just like... I thought they were going
to put down like $3,000. I think potentially
tomorrow morning, we head to Sydney. Yeah, it's, I mean...
Grab it from under them. all of their regions
are vulnerable right now. I mean, we're one to talk.
We just put down a dollar. Well, I think
Tasmania's not vulnerable. Well, no, Tasmania's
not vulnerable, but... Alright, we gotta boogie. Alright. Alright, alright,
we gotta boogie. I think we— I mean,
I shouldn't say anything. Yeah, I wouldn't say anything. (chuckles)
I'm not gonna say anything. I wouldn't. We're just gonna see
what happens this time. See what happens, certainly. What's fun is that we really,
with our hats now, we really blend in with the locals. Yes, well, everyone
who lives in Australia is issued one of these. Right, that's true.
I imagine. And we definitely haven't
been getting a lot of looks. Yeah. Alright.
Off to the city then. Thank you.
Thank you. There, I can frame it up. We've made it to
Flinders Street station. Which means we have made
it to the Challenge Board. It's the Challenge Board. Everyone say... yay, it's the Challenge Board. There's some fun ones, Ben. Number one: Race a car
at Albert Park Circuit. Okay. Basically, we have
to make a little car, and we have to push it
35 feet. We get one try.
Okay. Roll a ball down the
100 Steps of Federation. Okay.
That is a steal. It's a steal.
A 50% steal. Okay. I don't know that we
wanna do that right now. I don't know that we
wanna do it, but it's there. Good to know that it's there. Predict a popular
Brighton Beach Box. So there are these
famous 93 bathing boxes Yeah.
...on Brighton Beach. And you have to guess
between two of them which one someone will
take a photo of first. Okay, that seems doable. And finally, be familiar
with your teammates' game. So that's one of us has
to run like 300 feet, and the other one has to guess how fast they'll do it
within 15%. Okay.
That's a 2x. I think we should do the car. I just feel confident
that we can achieve this. If we are careful, and we do
a good job building the car, I am confident
we can achieve this. It's a long distance
to send the car, but... I mean, 30 feet? That's how far the Barbie was. Yeah, I think it's doable. I think it's doable, but we're
gonna have to really be careful. Okay.
I think let's just go for it. How much do you
want to put on it? Well, that's the thing. I think if we're
gonna invest the time, we should really... Make it worth our while.
Make it worth our while. I think we should
put down $1,000. How much do we have?
$1,389. But tomorrow,
we'll get another $250. Wouldn't kill us. I think we can do this
if we invest the time. But I think if we're
going to invest the time, we need to make it worth it. (huffs)
It's a bit of a risk, but I think let's just
put in $1,000. I think let's do $1,000.
Let's just do it and then go. Okay, let's go.
Alright. (imitates slot machine lever) So we've made it to Canberra. We got the $750 welcome bonus. We're doing good,
and we're going— We're just waiting for
the bus into the city. I think the bus is
about to pull up. Alright. Alright, Benjamin. Let's go buy some
incredible materials. Look, we are no strangers to building a little cart
on this show. It's true.
And we've only ever done an awesome job of that. We call it the Mamma Mia. There's an Italian man
right there, Adam. Don't be insensitive. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
They've got wheels. Now here's the thing. Last time, we made
a huge mistake, and we bought wheels...
...that swiveled. And this time we will not
make that same mistake. Cut to the swiveling wheels. Oh god. We will be buying big,
non-swiveling wheels. Are we able to find
an axle of some kind? You know? Well, no, no, no.
You don't need an axle, because these are
on their own thing. No, no, well... I worry that those are
going to be too small. What if our car had this? Ah... Just, you keep—
you look at these wheels. Let me cook with this
for a second. Let me cook. Okay, you cook. You cook. Alright. Okay, this isn't
gonna work at all. I think this would be perfect. You know what I mean? You get four of these. I think we are... I think there's
almost no way to fail. Okay, let's get those. Let's go with this. And let's go. Okay.
Okay. Shall we set ourselves up... somewhere, or...? Alright. Time for a little bit of a walk. Yeah.
To the Challenge Board. One thing that's rather fitting
about the Parliament of Australia is that the transit to it... is not very good.
(both chuckle) Much like the transit
in much of this country. Yeah, I'm not
really sure that they want hordes of tourists coming here. Don't you want
your parliamentarians taking the bus to work? They have an
underground car park. Now that's fitting. Alright, Toby. Welcome to the
Parliament of Australia. Welcome to you as well. So, I've heard
you've been inside here. I have.
I've met the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese. I don't mean to boast. That's kind of cool. But, you know, what's also cool
is we have our challenges. Hopefully these
are also cool, yeah. Become a socceroo. We have to kick a ball from
20 feet away into a sock. We have 10 attempts. I am banning physical challenges. Not our style. Challenge 2. We have to identify 10 flags at the International Flag Display. Love it.
That's right down there. Mental task.
We've been studying. That is our style. Challenge 3:
Royal Australian Mint. We have to correctly guess which way a coin
is going to flip eight times in a row. We have half an hour.
That seems tough. Mathematically improbable. Challenge 4, 40% steal: Acquire and complete
a jigsaw puzzle of at least 250 pieces
in 60 minutes. That seems not terrible. I like that one. If they had more money, and I felt like it would
make more of an impact... Yeah, their balance
is quite low right now. So, I don't think that makes sense. I think what makes sense is to go do the Flag Display. We have,
by the time we get there, we'll still have two hours
in the game day. Yep.
We could study a lot. We love challenges
where we can optimise, increase our odds to
as close as 100% as possible. Doing one of those is
better than a day of kicking a ball into a sock. (metal clattering) Alright Ben, I think we got
45 minutes max to do this. Time to construct our cart. Imagine that we're like
an F1 pit crew, right? Maybe we could put— We could have a little
outfit drawn on us. Or some— don't do that. That's probably going
to cost too much money. There can be
no doubt that this was the cheapest saw. This is great. The windy day is actually
helping us see the flags. Yeah, and they have
names to help us out. Oh, names? Oh, great. Don't look at them for now,
so we can practice. This is the start,
because that's Afghanistan at the start, which is A. Oh wait,
they're alphabetical too? They are alphabetical.
Oh, this is clutch. This is so clutch.
This is clutch. This is what I was hoping for,
an alphabetical list, starting with Afghanistan up there.
This is so good. So let's make a game plan. So, the fact that
they're alphabetical is a tremendous, mega,
unbelievable shortcut. I wanna wager
a lot on this. So how about I go
study that side, you study this side,
and then we come together? Don't expect to
hear from me anytime soon. Fair enough. Yep, same. Alright, see you in a bit.
Alright, see ya. Okay, why— It's just
stopped cutting now. Well, it's 'cause
you're hitting the... Oh, I see. We'll cut from
the other side first. Well, it's not
gonna get through. This is unfortunate. Do we think... that we could... Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I got it. Good enough. So, take a wheel. There you go. I think we got it. Okay, let's get to
the F1 track and... and put our car to the test. Oh, now I'm nervous! Don't be nervous. I think we put
enough sauce on it. That's what F1's all about. It's about a little bit of sauce. It's about how much
sauce they put on it. And the car itself really
has nothing to do with it. It's really mostly about the sauce. Yeah, into the city. So I've done
a couple of practices with no mistakes now. Yeah, that's what I just did. So what I've been doing is... putting an entry for every flag into my mind palace. So I've been associating
each country's name with some kind of
memorable thing. Like a, you know,
a common object or something
that sounds the same, something very memorable
and unique. For example, the first one,
Afghanistan. The flag looks like
kind of like a stamp. So I've been memorising
it as 'Afghani-stamp'. Bangladesh looks like
a dinner plate, so I memorise it as
'Bangla-dish'. Albania... bird mania. I've got one for everything. And they're in the
mind palace and they're ready. Personally,
I just memorize them. Isn't it so sad that we're the ones here,
and not Sam? Sam would be so excited
to see all this happen. He was so excited
when we put this on. And you know what? You know what I say
to this, Sam? It's stupid. This is the circuit. I don't think that
we can be here. Are the F1 fans satisfied? Let's just... Okay, you see, it's right here. And here we go.
This is the real F1 track. I think this way,
so they can kind of see the spans and such. Yeah, let me get
a good shot for you freakin' people. If we get the track,
it's gonna be beautiful. Myanmar, Morocco, Mongolia, Mexico, Mauritius, Malta, Malaysia, Lithuania,
Libya, Lebanon. I reckon we got this. I reckon we've got this. Let's put it all on. Okay. You wanna put it all on? If we're gonna put it all on, then we'll both do
one more pass. 'Cause I wanna do
one more pass. Alright, so let's do
another quick pass at yours and then do it, but...
Yeah. I wanna go all in. Okay. I'd like... we got this. All in as in
every single dollar? Why not? One. Push. I'm going to push
forward and down. Forward and down.
And two, I'm gonna not chicken out on how far I— on how hard I go.
(distant car speeding) Yeah, hold on.
Something epic is happening. (car speeding past) Very cool. Let's set the stakes. If this does not work
on the first try... we lose how much money? A thousand dollars. And we have $300 left.
One thousand Australian dollars. And... then we're (bleep)-ed. I would say
we'd be pretty (bleep)-ed. If we lose this, we are
on the brink of debt. Yes, but... we should not be doing this
unless we have 100% confidence. Yeah. There's always
a chance I forget one. Yeah. Or mix up one. Yeah. But, with the context
of order and alphabetization, I think statistical odds are 99.9%. Alright, my biggest worry is that it's going
to veer really far one way or the other. Yes. We gotta make sure
that it's straight, and you got enough, so— Again, it's about the sauce. The sauce is critical. Okay.
Alright, here we go. It's gotta pass me,
the finish line. Ready? (wheels scraping) It's getting dark,
and we're losing wind, so we actually have to do it now, because they're
getting harder to see. Okay, are you ready? Yes
Are we going all in? For the lols. YOLO. YOLO.
This couldn't go wrong, right? This couldn't go wrong. (rasps) Is this the riskiest thing
we've ever done on Jet Lag: The Game? That is $1,243 in. Oh my god. You ready for this? Should I press it? It's you. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Wait, it's you? No, it's Toby.
No, it's Toby. Oh, okay. And it's you
who could find out not only if Toby
gets the flags right, but if we manage to do
the Formula One car right. You can find that out right now by watching the
next episode on Nebula. And one of the things
that we do on Nebula is we, every single week,
we sit down and do our sort of BTS podcast. It's called The Layover. Basically if you want
more Jet Lag stuff but without all this
crazy video stuff... (shudders) you know, go to listen
to the Layover podcast and hear about
all of our excuses for why various things
that went wrong are not really our fault. That's true.
It's almost never our fault. No, no.
No. If you love our voices,
but hate our ugly mugs, that's the best way to consume
Jet Lag content, but— You could watch the show
with your eyes closed. You, well, yeah,
it would be kind of confusing. But you can also go ahead and watch a whole bunch
of other great stuff that is exclusive only to Nebula by your other favorite creators. I mean, we've got
documentaries on there. We've got a sort of
prototype version of Jet Lag that was really chaotic. But there's also, there's
so much stuff on Nebula. You've got Originals
from great channels like RealLifeLore,
Real Engineering, Lindsay Ellis, neo, Mustard. There's simply
endless, boundless content for you to enjoy on Nebula. Yes, and if you
would like to sign up, we can give you
a little special deal if we keep it among ourselves. Because if you go
to nebula.tv/jetlag, you can get... let's call it 40%,
does that sound good? I think, I would go to 40. Yeah, 40. 40% off the
annual subscription, which brings it down to,
I want to say... Math, math, math, math, math. That would be $30.
Ooh, that's pretty good math. That'd be $30 a year.
$30 a year. Not a month.
$30 a year. How many is that a month, Ben? Don't ask me. I didn't go to school for that. You did a Math Minute drunk. That's true. Well, I guess that
didn't have 30 divided by 12, which equals 2.5. 2.5, that's $2.50. Yeah. And that's not that many dollars. No, it's only two dollars and then another half of a dollar. Yeah, and with that, again, you can get the next episode
of Jet Lag early. You can get the
Layover podcast exclusively. You can get all sorts of
other exclusive content. And you can even help
support us make this show. Because these are the dollars
that we use to, you know, pay for very important
things like... like wheels. Yeah, we spent
a lot on wheels. I actually don't know if you know how much
we spent on wheels. How many Nebula subscriptions
did we spend on wheels? We... I feel, I would
feel bad if I said it. We spent about 3.5 annual
subscriptions on wheels. If you want more wheels, we're gonna need more
Nebula subscriptions. So go to nebula.tv/jetlag
to sign up. And thank you, because... I don't know how we're gonna
afford all these wheels. Yeah, our biggest cost
this season was wheels. Yeah, okay, bye. Bye!"

Carbon offset by the Gold Standard: https://registry.goldstandard.org/credit-blocks/details/432512","abwiCon6IjU","Hello, and
welcome to episode two of Jet Lag: Australia. The goal of this game is to control more of Australia's eight regions
than your opponents by the end of four days. Winning is all about money. You take control of regions
by depositing money in them, you have to spend money
to travel between regions, and you earn more money
by gambling on challenges. All of which is why
me and my partner Toby are pretty concerned right now. Last episode,
our opponents Ben and Adam went to the difficult-to-reach
region of Tasmania, where they earned over $2,000 by winning big bets
on two challenges, including landing a
shrimp on a Barbie. Meanwhile, Toby and I
lost our bet on winning a carnival game
in Sydney. Now we've flown to a
new region: Queensland. Specifically, we've flown
to Gold Coast, Australia's amusement park capital, because several of the most
valuable Queensland challenges involve going to theme parks. If any of them pop up, we'll be in prime position
to take advantage and get back in the game. Alright Toby,
challenges are generated. What are they? First one, calculate boba. We've gotta guess within 10% how many boba are in the thing. Two, get goosebumps
near a goose. 3x multiplier, but I don't know where we're going to
get a goose around here. Match your teammate. That's where we have
to buy the same item without coordinating at a store. Challenge four: Movie World. We have to find a
Looney Tunes character in the wild within an hour. When does Movie World shut? But it's a 3.5x multiplier. I don't think for a while.
Let's check. There's a rainbow. Sam, there's a rainbow. Sam, get the rainbow. Make a wish,
and you better wish— I wish Ben and Adam's
plane derails. No! Okay, Movie World
closes at... five? (grimaces)
Let's calm down. Let's calm down.
Oh, that's bad. Oh my god. That sucks. That would have been
really good for us. That sucks! No! That would have been
really good for us. Because we're here
at the Gold Coast. So, we're in a good spot. We've got our flight. I don't think there's any chance
we're gonna miss it. I shouldn't say that,
but I think we're... yeah, not under a crazy
amount of time pressure. No.
Got a lot of money. Yeah, so... I think first thing is, we should just invest
some of our money in Tasmania now. Because anytime you have
money in your wallet, it is vulnerable to a steal. Yes. I don't know if we've
explained this yet. If we haven't, here's a little
explanation of what that is. While most challenges involve
gambling some of your money to win a multiple of your money, steal challenges involve
gambling some of your money to win a portion of
your opponent's money. Each steal is set at a
percentage of a team's budget. A 40% steal, for example,
would risk 40% of your money. If you won, you would
get your money back, and you would take 40%
of your opponent's money. You might notice that this means that if one team's budget
is very low, and one team's budget
is very high, a steal would be highly advantageous to the team that's behind. And yep, that's the point. The risk of steal means
teams should be very careful about carrying a high balance. I think we want to put in
at least $1,000 up to $1,500. But we can start with $1,000 just to get it out of our wallet. Boom, graphic. Okay, now,
it's really a question of, do we want to do the
Tim Tam cutting challenge? I feel okay
taking a risk right now. So maybe we just put $1,000 into the Tim Tam thing
and try it. And if it— if we're really careful
and we make it work, then there's another
$1,000 in the bank. Alright, I'm willing
to put in $1,000. It's scary.
Scares me. But I think we should do it. Okay, so now we have
to go get Tim Tams. And we have to figure out
what we want to cut them with. So, let's go do that. Oh, that's really unfortunate. What sort of theme park
closes at 5 pm? Disney World's open
until like midnight. We're not in America anymore. As Ben and Adam went
to buy their Tim Tams, Toby and I decided to
cut our losses and head up to nearby Brisbane,
where we could do some of the day's
lower value challenges. Brisbane, conveniently,
also has an access point for Queensland's Challenge Board. So we'd be in a good position
to check it tomorrow. Meanwhile, Adam and Ben
grabbed their Tim Tams and were ready to
do their challenge. Okay. So I think the question is,
what do we cut it with? I think the first place
your head goes is a credit card. We could always
sharpen a credit card. I have my Lego VIP card. We could sacrifice that. Why don't we get a knife... and sharpen the card... and then cut the Tim Tam? While they sharpened
Ben's Lego Rewards card, on the way to Brisbane, we tried to salvage
our bad challenge pool. And I came up with
what I believed was a surefire way
to nail one of them. The challenge requires one person
to buy something at a store, which your teammates may
inspect with their eyes closed. They must then go to the store
and buy the exact same item. Other than revealing I wanted
to go to the Apple Store, I couldn't tell Toby my plan, but I managed to
convince her to trust me that we should bet big. I feel good. As long as—
You seem very— You seem more confident
than I've seen you in a long time. I'm confident,
and I think if you... you think it through,
you evaluate as much as you can. I'm confident. I don't love the phrase
""think it through"", but... I think we want to do $900. Lock it in?
I'm happy with it, yeah. I'll be right back.
See ya. This should do it. So, we've got our cookie here. And we're just going to leave
a little bit of it exposed. So, just, you know... We're just getting acquainted
with the cookie here. Wow, this is actually
incredibly nerve wracking to watch happen now. Yeah. It's okay. Actually, I'm
feeling worse now... that I'm sort of seeing
it happen. Alright. You ready? You got this, I'm sure. Alright, while Toby
examines the item, let me explain my strat. I bought an
Apple MagSafe charger. It's got a big round end to it, it's the only thing like it
that Apple sells, and it only comes in
one cord length with one type of port. This should be foolproof. I think... Yeah, no, come on. I probably looked
insane doing that. You ready? As ready as I guess I'll be. Excuse me. Oh, you're really going now. As you can see, the cookies
are starting to pry apart. But I actually think that's... Dangerous. That's where we
start to get dangerous, 'cause if there's
too much leverage... Yeah.
applied... This, I think, is sort
of a danger zone situation. Yeah. Hello, Sam. Hello. How are you feeling? Let's see what you got. Got something
in my pocket here. That sure looks right, Toby. (laughs) Nice job.
Amazing! Nice job. That's great. Great, amazing.
That just gets us 900 extra... dollarydoos. That's what they
call 'em here, right? I think we're close. I see the cookies separating. Yeah, but we
just don't wanna... make it— My biggest worry is stickage. Oh. Just move the one, I think. We've done it.
(sighs heavily) We have two intact sides. That actually, I think,
was a lot riskier than we thought it was. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay.
Uh-huh. Okay. Let's go to the airport... and go to Adelaide. Yeah. Hi. Just going to the airport. So... I reckon we want to
go get some boba. Uh-oh. Calculate boba. Bubble tea is a popular
snack all across Oceania. Order one bubble tea at
any bubble tea vendor. From the second
you pick up your drink, you have one minute
to examine it and determine the
number of boba inside. Drink the tea and
empty out the boba to check your answer. If you were more than 10% off, this challenge is failed. Let me just tell you, or let's just think
about what we think a boba-sized cup is. You could calculate the
volume of a cylinder, which is, you have a radius
and the height of the pearls that you think it goes up to. Then you take that volume,
you times it by 0.74, which is if you have
tightly-packed spheres, how much space
they can possibly take up from the cylinder. Then you divide that number
by the volume of the bobas. Well, if you can try
that while I'm doing it, and then I'll just do
kind of the gut check. My confidence level
is not great. Neither is mine. I think it's a real crapshoot. My confidence—
Should we put... $206? Just to get rid of that
and have nice easy numbers? Yeah.
I'm happy with $206. Yep, let's do it.
Okay, let's go to boba. Okay. Alright, here's the thing, Ben. I kind of think we should
put down another $1,000. Yeah, I mean, we just got
another $1,000 pretty quick. I think, just saying. You know what,
throw that down. There's $2,000 on Tasmania. I don't think they'll touch it. I think that sends
a clear signal. Because my strategy is, I don't want to have
to come back places. Yeah, I agree. I don't think we want to
go halfway on a region, leave, and then come back later. I've enjoyed
our time in Tasmania. I do not want to have
to come back here. No. I want Tasmania
to be locked up, and I want it to
have a number on it, where it's like... ""Oh man, it would really not
be worth it to go there."" Right. We've got the money
to put down another $1,000. I think we should just do it. Yep. Let's do it. Alright. Cue the graphic. Graphic, graphic, graphic, graphic. Good job, graphic. Alright. I think we did an
incredible job in Tasmania. I agree.
I think we cleaned up. And I think that we can
do the same thing in South Australia. Yep, yep. Hi, could I please have a regular green tea
with the tapioca pearls? Thank you. Number 8. Alright, Toby, come on. Alright, Toby, Toby.
Our time starts. It's cloudier than I hoped. I feel like in one layer,
I counted about 22, 24, and it looks like there's
about four layers tall. So I'd be comfortable
going 80, maybe 82. 85. Okay, we got five seconds. 85, you wanna say 85? Lock it in? Lock it in, okay, 85. You wanna get sippin'?
(snickers) Doubts loading. Doubts loading. Whew.
Alright. Adam, you're about
to enter the hug zone. Whoa. Just make note of that. What do you reckon?
Is this the kind of park where they let you
count your pearls? (shudders)
Everybody out. Alright, make groups of ten. Eight, nine. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Nine, no! No... no...
No. Naur. No.
Naur. We need to be better. Well, we're here
at the Hobart Airport. You know, we're just,
we're about to board. But we've still got
all of those Tim Tams. Yeah, the problem is that
I left the Tim Tams somewhere. Oh, (bleep), really? Yeah. They're in the
Snack Zone, baby! We're going to
predict some Snack Zones. If they've already eaten
a Tim Tam, do Adam's reaction
to the Tim Tam. Well, I think everyone's
reaction to the Tim Tam, including Adam's,
would be like... ""Oh, this is... fine."" This is... one of the most medium
tasting things I've ever had. Alright, I'm going
to stay on the ground because I feel like
this is where I belong. But what should we do now? We have a bit more
than an hour left. And the only challenge we could
reasonably do is the swan. I just don't know how we
would possibly get goosebumps. The internet said that you can rub the hairs on
your arms very lightly. Well, we can try. We should—
We can try here to see if we can make it. The internet also said
you can just manifest them in your head,
at the back of your head. Can you? Here, let me try. We're (bleep)-ed. Alright, here we go. Wheee!
Goodbye, Tazzy. Let's walk to the river and see if there's any geese there. Because we're obviously not
going to make it to a lake. Yeah, no, and we want to be at the Brisbane sign
tomorrow morning. Let's start walking. I don't see any geese. So... Should we go to the sign? So that's what we need to
do to generate challenges in the morning anyway. Yes, oh, let's go to the sign. It is a good sign. It's nice, yeah. It's got good colors. I think this is the end
of our day one, right? I think so. We're not massively behind. We are certainly not ahead. I mean, I think
we're doing okay. Let's just do better tomorrow. Well, hopefully, you know, luck swings more onto
our side tomorrow, because it seemed like it was pretty firmly on their side today. Alright, good night, everyone. Good night. Okay, welcome to
Adelaide, South Australia. Thank you. I think it's time for bed. Alright, see you tomorrow. Mwah. Alright, now it's
the end of day one, and time for the first rest period. From 8:30 pm to 7:30 am
Sydney time, both teams must stop
what they're doing and go to a hotel for
some much needed rest before restarting the game at the exact same spot
the next morning. And just like that,
through the magic of editing, it's time to start day two. Alright, good morning, Toby. Hi, good morning.
It's 6:30, and day two is now on. Good morning.
Good morning. From South Australia. We need to get
to the Challenge Board, which is where, in the park? We're going to Victoria Square. Yeah.
But we— I think we gotta get on a bus. 'Cause the trains are not
connected to the airport. Which, I think, is a bad idea. But also that's how it
is in New York, so... Can't judge.
Can't judge. Our challenges are generated. Should we take a look? Yeah, what are they? First one: Brisbane sign. That's a 40% steal.
Oh, would you look at that? Okay, cool. We might want to
act on that quickly. In case they try to put
away some of their budget. Yeah. Second one:
land a bottle right side up. Third one: Dreamworld.
That's interesting. Fourth one: Wheel of Brisbane.
That's right there. Okay, but let's think
about the steal. We have about the same
amount of money right now. We both have like 22,
20-ish, hundred-ish. We could invest a bunch
into Queensland right now so that our 40% is
a lot less than their 40%... and then go for the steal. Yes. I think we need to
decide pretty quickly so that they hopefully don't also
drop money onto their region. Just to clarify, because steals risk a set
percentage of your budget to win a set percentage
of your opponent's budget, you want to do steals
when your budget is low and your opponent's budget is high. So before starting it, Toby and I deposited
$750 into Queensland, lowering our budget and our risk. Then, before Ben and Adam could dump any of their
money into South Australia, we informed them that
the steal was initiated, locking up 40% of their budget
until it was complete. This steal challenge,
to be clear, is as follows: Mind meld at the Brisbane sign. One team member must, without giving any prior
hints or information, select one letter in
the Brisbane sign. The other team member
then gets three attempts to guess which letter
their partner selected. They just
invested in Queensland. How much? I'm trying to figure that out. Uh-oh, Ben. What? They have activated a steal. They've activated
a steal, okay. (sighs) Yeah, I feel stupid. I feel like we
should've invested money the second we got to Adelaide. I just didn't wanna... lock up too much of our money before we knew
what was gonna happen. I just didn't realize the
timing would be that sensitive. But, okay, okay, look. Here's the thing about steals. Whatever it is that
they're doing, it's risky. Do you want to guess... or do you want to pick a letter? Do you have a preference? I don't have a preference. I'd like to pick the letter. Okay, well then we'll do that. You better get on
my brain wave, Sam. I'll let you
know when I'm done. Okay, I think there
is only one letter that makes more sense
than the other ones... and that's the first one. Why would you pick
anything but the first one, is my thinking, if we're
trying to pick the same one. So I'm just gonna
take a photo of the first B. (camera click)
B. Toby! Okay, we wanna take the... yeah, the J2. Thank you. Thank you. I hope this bus is
going the right way. Okay. Look, it's not great. No. I think in the future,
when we get somewhere, we should deposit
immediately. It's true. I mean, look.
That's the thing with the steals. They just are really risky. Yeah, I mean, we just have to hope
that they fail. I can't tell you anything. I can't. Okay, well, I'm just gonna
psychically get on your brain wave. If I was the person taking
the photo of the letter... I would think, which letter has something
distinctive about it? So finding something that I guess both team members
would in their mind think is special about one letter. And so for that reason,
I'm going to pick the first letter,
which is the first B. Because that's special. You're not reacting. Am I right or wrong? Yes! That was the perfect logic. No other letter makes sense. Adam says,
""Good luck with the steal, hope you fail, kiss emoji."" You can send him ""40% of your money, please,
kiss emoji, kiss emoji."" Ben, I have bad news. They succeeded at the steal. I also have further bad news, which is that we got on
a bus going the wrong way, and now we have to get off
and get on a different bus. So it's not a very
good start to the day. No, we are 11 minutes in, and thus far... this has been atrocious for us. Well... I went in today
feeling so good. I started the day
with a lot of confidence. And then we got
on the wrong bus, and then they took
half our money. Nice, alright,
we're doing well. Woo! Okay, so, let's find a
good place to sit and chat. This is a nice little
pocket for strategy talk. Okay, so... So, Toby and I
weren't too compelled by the rest of today's
Queensland challenges. So we decided to look for
a flight to a new region. Ideally, we wanted
to go to Canberra, in the Australian Capital Territory. It's a territory that's actually completely surrounded
by New South Wales, but it counts just as much
as any other region. The trouble was,
all the direct flights there were too expensive
or poorly timed. But there was a cheap flight
to Sydney in a few hours, and Sydney actually
has cheap and quick flights, trains, and even buses
to the Capital Territory. So we decided we'd fly to Sydney,
shore up New South Wales, and then head to Canberra
in the afternoon. So we booked that flight, and with the time before
we needed to go to the airport, we figured we might as well
complete this challenge, which requires you to flip a bottle
and land on its lid. It didn't seem too tough,
so we wagered $500 on it and got the bottle with the
biggest lid we could find. Finally, we also deposited an
additional $596 in Queensland in order to further
reduce our budget in case Ben and Adam, who had finally gotten on
a bus going the right way, got access to a steal. Alright, Ben. Let's go to
the Challenge Board. You know, it took us a little
longer than anticipated, but we're gonna make it there. (groans angrily) Things were going so good
an hour ago. The ducks here are very polite. That's not a duck, though. What is that one? What are you? Okay, they don't like me. Let's see what the challenges
in South Australia are today. Adam? Predict market flow
at Adelaide's Central Market. You have to pick a
stall at the market and guess how many people
are going to go to it. 40% margin of error. Toss a tempting meal. We have to throw food
on the ground, and within 10 seconds,
an animal has to eat it. I think we could do that here. I think we could do it here. Face Tim Tam. That's where you gotta do a
face cookie with a Tim Tam. And there's a steal. There's a steal, okay. You have to go to
the National Wine Centre and, blindfolded, distinguish
between a white, a red, and a rosé. Which would be easy
for a normal person, but we don't know
anything about wine. No, we don't drink wine at all. Okay. Definitely gets you going. I'm gonna take this off.
More friction. Is this attempt one?
I don't know. Well, let me give it a first go. Give it an attempt. See how it goes,
and let's adjust from there. No.
Okay. I think we need
to try to earn... $2,000 here. You also have to keep in mind, we need to have enough
money to get out of here. What we've been seeing is that the flights out of here
are pretty expensive. The safest one is the meal. Yeah. But it has a low return. It has a low return. But maybe we just put
a ton of money into it. I think we can do the birds. Okay, how much money
are we putting down on it? A decent amount
for it to be worth it. Yeah, it's only 1.5. What do you think?
I think half, $850. Okay, $850. Toss a tempting meal. Throw a single piece of food. Within 10 seconds of it
touching the ground or water, something besides you must eat it. If the food is not eaten
after 10 seconds, this challenge is failed. Alright.
Let's go find a bird food. They're still just
in downtown Brisbane. I have no idea what challenge
they're possibly doing right now, but, I don't know. I hope they fail it, I guess. (grimaces) (grunts) Okay. I'm getting a little stressed. Just calm down, actually. Take a five minute breather. What is ducks' favorite food? Ducks enjoy berries,
melonseed, and pitfruits. What about a blueberry? I like blueberry best, because I think a
blueberry is like a treat. Yeah, it's more tempting. Okay, let's get some blueberries. Oh, now I'm scared. Thank you. I think... this ground is pretty slippery. Yeah, I think let's find
some more coarse ground. Maybe over there. (rapid scraping) Oh, you're roughening it up? Yeah. (giggles) I don't know what this is. (grumbles) I want to watch a video. We're going to
take our time with this. I'm so scared now. Okay, don't be scared. Alright.
Ducks? Okay. I think I'm more
approachable to ducks. Yep. Ducks, how about a
little blueberry treat? Is this interesting to them? We're going to
get on their level. (duck quacks) Okay. He's yelling about it. (duck quacks) What are you saying? What about, there's
several ducks over here. Why don't you let me try
with the ducks this time? See, they're walking away. You're going too fast. They really don't trust us. No, they don't like us at all. The ducks don't
care about this at all. Okay. Ready? Yep. What happened there? It just... it landed like this... and then kinda
careened that way. Is that, yeah, look at that. That bottle's always
going to fall over. We're not using that bottle anymore. I think we need a new bottle. Okay, let me just, I'll quickly
go run and come back. I mean, we could
try a different food. Well, I just think we need
to get closer to the ducks. Wait, look at this. There's a girl feeding the ducks. Oh, this is huge news. Oh, they love being fed. Okay, this might be our chance. They're all around
looking for food. They're in the mood. Do you want to go for it? I think this is our chance. Okay. Go for it. There it is. There it is. One. Two. Three. Four. Find it.
Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. No. Ugh. Ugh. That's so stupid. Oh my gosh, I can't
believe we blew that. That is terrible, Ben. Okay. This is not good news! I think we want
to go to Melbourne. Well, we need $1,300 for that. Right, we don't have enough money
to go to Melbourne. So we gotta do Face Tim Tam, Adelaide's Central Market, or... But the thing is, if we try
another challenge and fail, I struggle to see how
we'll ever get enough money to leave Adelaide today. Yeah, I agree. But we've gotta do something. I know. I mean, the truth is, we're just in a
very bad position now. Yeah, no, we are. It's just, the question is, how do we get in a
less bad position? Flip it one and a half times. Or even— (grunts) This isn't going to work. We need to solve it somehow. I just don't know how, and I know that if we
want to make our flight, we don't have infinite time. But this is really
important to get right. I know, but to be honest, I just kind of regret
staking this much. It's a lot harder
than I thought it was. Can I run and
get another bottle? I mean, sure, yeah. I'm going to leave you here
unattended for a minute. Okay. Yeah, I mean, we can
definitely get one, but I'm not sure it
makes sense to flip. Hello, we've been really
just going back and forth trying to figure out what is
the best thing to do here, because the fact of the matter is, we just, we don't
have great options. The flights out of here
are all really expensive. I don't know why,
and it's just today. I think we want to
predict market flow. How much should we bet? We have $1,064
at the moment, Ben. If we bet $600... then we would have $464 left. If we failed.
Yeah. That's probably
our safest option. Okay, $600. It's big, big epic win time. Here we go. Okay, $600.
We're going in. Predict market flow at
Adelaide's Central Market. Adelaide's Central Market is
one of the largest produce markets in the southern hemisphere. Select any market stall
and make a prediction about how many customers
it will get in the next 10 minutes. A customer is defined as any person
who spends money at the stall. If your prediction
is more than 40% off, this challenge is failed. If no one visits the stall
in the 10 minutes, you lose automatically. I think that... the key to this is simple. High volume... reduces variability. So we just need to find
the busiest stand we can. Observe it for like a half hour, put in our guess, and then as long as
nothing drastically changes, we'll be fine. I think that that first place
when we walked in, that's our best option. Let's observe. I'm gonna go
get a custard tart. Do you want one? Uh, no. Iced latte? Yeah. Okay, I might have
gone a little bit crazy, but I think this is the best shot, because I think it's
better than that one. Mm-kay.
And then I got this one in case we can find a video
of Logan Paul flipping it, because I feel like that's possible. Okay, we have about 10 minutes
to be able to comfortably That's okay.
...make it to the airport. Yeah, this one doesn't
seem a whole lot better. Okay, if it's not going
to work, just discard it. Hello. Okay, so... We've been watching
this market stall for what, 30 minutes? Yeah, super normal behavior. At this food market, we recorded three different
periods of 10 minutes. The number of customers
were 10, then 20, then 14. Which is a wider range
than I would like. I think that the 10
is the biggest outlier in that we were
doing that earlier. So if we guess 20, our range of 40% on both ends would be 12 to 28. And I think the real concern
would just be getting over 12. I think we'll hit 12. Okay, do we want to
guess 20? Do we want to lock
that in right now? Okay, the market looks busy. I think we're going to start now. Are you ready, Adam?
Yep, yep. Ten minute timer starts... now. You count people
when they pay. If it's a group of two,
they only count as one. Yep. So that's one person's paid. That's two people have paid. Great. Okay, new woman. That's three. Three. That's four. Four. Okay, we're at four. Okay. Is this
another customer? This looks like a duo. Oh my god. I am... I'm freaking out.
(laughs) I'm gonna die. Alright, we have
three attempts left. You've got this. I'm gonna give it my all.
I believe in you. I don't think
the odds are good. Doesn't matter.
You can do it. Oh god, Ben. No one's coming.
It's emptying out. More than I'd like.
Why did it empty out? Why did it empty out? We guessed too high, Ben.
It's okay. These people are
another customer. We've got a woman buying
grapes in front of us. Okay, so they'll get us to six. I'm freaking out. So this lady will be five, right? Yep. Oh no, the people who were
looking over there have gone. They've left, Ben. Wait.
Oh no, they're back. There's more, there's more.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, that's a duo.
So that's five. These people will be six. Once they've paid, they'll be six. (shudders) Alright, two more. This is it. Okay, you've
got the feel for it. You've got the feel for it. That was all practice.
I mean, I'm confident that I'm giving it my best shot. Yeah, you got
heaps of practice. Okay, they've paid. That's six. That woman is seven. We're at four minutes,
and we're at seven. I think that's pretty good. This guy's eight. Okay, and we've got
this woman with a watermelon. Yeah, she's at nine. Look, we have four minutes
and fifteen seconds to get three more purchases. Uh-oh, now there's no one
manning the cash register. No, go back to
the cash register. We have four minutes.
We need three more purchases, Ben. Three more purchases.
A lot of people, I feel like, abandoned the stand. Alright, this is it. You've got the feel for it. That was all practice. This is it. This is it.
You've got this. Caption+ by JS*

the next episode right now on— You're getting worse at this.
Oh god dammit. Stop pressuring me! Watch the next episode
now on Nebula. It's available right now on Nebula,
like all of our episodes. Here, can you do the rest?
I need to do this. You can find out if Sam
manages to flip the bottle. You can see if Ben and I
managed to hit our minimum at the Adelaide Central Market. You can also listen to
the Layover podcast. The Layover podcast is an
exclusive aftershow podcast (bottle lands)
– that one was close – that we do after every episode where we recap the episode,
we give you the behind the scenes, we talk about things we had to cut. And Toby's there! And Toby does
the podcast with us for this season. So that's fun,
and you can listen to it. But only on Nebula.
Oh my god. And on Nebula,
you also get access to a lot of other really great
original content from other creators that you love. We've got Modern Conflicts from
RealLifeLore, a great series. We've got some original series from Real Engineering. We've got a whole bunch of
Originals from Lindsay Ellis. We've— There's no
end to the con— I mean technically there
is an end to the content. But I should say that there is just a lot of great original
content on there. And a lot of other stuff
from us as well. Sam, wrap it up. Uh, um, it's cheap. It's not very expensive. It's what, like 30 bucks a year? Only if they go to our link,
nebula.tv/jetlag, where they get 40% off. But $30 for a year,
how many months are there? There's 12. And what is 30 divided by 12? It's like 4. It's two and a half. Yeah, okay, yeah. It's $2.50 a month, which... that's not many dollars. That's not that many dollars.
That's not that many dollars. It's not none,
but it's not that many. Well, it's enough dollars
to fund this entire show. That's true.
'Cause like... We make this
whole show for $2.50. Yeah, well, mm, yeah. It genuinely does support the show. It genuinely— Every single
dollar to produce this show comes thanks to our
Nebula subscribers. That's why we release every
single episode one week early. That's why we do
the Layover podcast. So we really appreciate
when you do sign up at nebula.tv/jetlag. Flip the bottle,
end the ad reading. And we're gonna get it right.
We're gonna get it right. Here we go.
It's gonna be so good. Not even close.
Not even a little bit. No, we're gonna VFX that. You know, VFX team is gonna do it.
I said I can do it. No, you're not gonna do it. That was close though.
No it wasn't. Okay, bye."

Carbon offset by the Gold Standard: https://registry.goldstandard.org/credit-blocks/details/432512","rNxi1-UgV2I","Welcome to Australia. The world's 6th largest country
and the 3 million square mile board for our game about
travel, money, and risk. We're here in Sydney, Australia,
and we've got $1,000 each. Over the next four days, we're gonna be spending it,
gambling it, and stealing it as we race across the country
trying to claim the most regions. But right now, it's 7:30 am. So we gotta go, go, go! Alright, let's go!
Alright, Ben. Let's check the
New South Wales challenges. Let's go, Toby! Eeee!
We're back! Alright, so this is a game
all about travel and money. The overall goal is simple:
at the end of four days, the team that controls more of
Australia's eight regions wins. Those regions are
the country's six states: Queensland,
New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia,
and Western Australia; and its two internal territories: the Northern Territory and the
Australian Capital Territory. In order to take control
of a region, a team must be
physically in the region, and then must deposit money into
the region from their budget. As little as one dollar can
give them control of the region, but there's a good reason
to deposit much more. If their opponents show up
later in the game and put down a higher deposit,
they'll steal control. There's no limit on
how often teams can deposit, so regions can change hands a number of times
throughout the game. But teams will need to be
smart with their money, because that same money
will be used to pay for their travel between regions. The more teams spend
on flights, the less they'll have to deposit. The good news is, teams can
make money by doing challenges. That's why both teams are
running to the Opera House. That's where New South Wales's
Challenge Board is. Alright, so the first thing
we have to decide... Do we want to try to
do some challenges and make some money,
or do we want to— —use our money
and kind of like— I think, let's go check out
what the challenges are for today. Yeah, we at least
want to know what it is. So we got to go to the—
—top of the Opera House and see what we can do. Yeah, the Challenge Board
is at the top of the Opera House. Isn't it gawrgeous here? Alright, let's get to the steps. Where are they? Oh, there they are. Alright, the
Challenge Board is here. Adam, what's on there? (Ben and Adam breathe heavily) Look at those slowpokes. Alright, here we go,
today's challenges. Okay, wait a minute. Before we show
the day's challenges, let's talk about how
these challenges work. You see, it's not as simple as
""do a challenge, win a prize."" Each challenge is a gamble...
literally. Before starting a challenge, teams will choose
how much of their budget to wager on the challenge. If they successfully complete it,
the money they wagered will be compounded by
that challenge's multiplier: 2x, 3x, even 4x. That means that with a big wager, teams could exponentially
increase their budget. But if they fail the challenge, all the money they wagered
will be gone. Alright, now let's
check out what challenges are available today
in New South Wales. Alright. Make a rock carving
at the indigenous rock engravings. Score an Australian football
goal in Redfern. Win a carnival game
at Luna Park. And taste test Australian foods, which is this challenge
where you have to eat a bunch of Australian snacks
at the same time and figure out
which ones they are. Trying to see if I can
get us any useful intel. There's some
good ones on there. Here comes the reaction.
Okay, yeah, so... I guess maybe we should
do the multipliers. They're just watching us. (Sam and Toby laugh)
They didn't even notice us! Hello! Hey guys, nice to see you. Come over here. I don't want them listening
to what we're gonna do. What? Did you see that? So we've got
a 2.5, a 2, a 3, and a 1.5. We could do one of these. Or we could just straight up leave.
Or we could leave. Let's look at the flights first. Alright, last rules thing. You might be wondering, why would a team want
to leave so soon? Well, the first team
to get to a new region receives a $750 welcome bonus. That's valuable, guaranteed money. So, at this early stage of the game,
the real question is: should teams stick around
and do challenges, or leave to claim a welcome bonus? Here's the thing to keep in mind. We only get the welcome bonuses
if we're first to another region. And they usually are more than
the cost to get to a region. And not only do
we want welcome bonuses, we want them to
not get welcome bonuses. That is true.
I'm happy to do, either fly to Melbourne now,
or do an easy challenge. Both of which I think are... both good options for us. Question is if there's
a good cheap flight. Yeah. There's a really cheap
one to Brisbane though. Ooh, there's a really
cheap one to Brisbane. Here's the thing,
I don't like being in the same region as them
trying to do challenges, because there's only
four challenges for today. And if they were to do one,
then there'd be even fewer options. It's true, and we don't know
what they might be doing. And so if they scoop it
while we're trying it, that's just wasted time. This game is really hard,
by the way. This is something
you're gonna see over the next few days. This game is very hard. It's incredibly hard. So there's a
pretty cheap flight to Melbourne at 9:25 am. So we might have the time to
do a challenge before then. Okay, here's what
I think we should do. I think we... Let's head to the airport,
but let's don't book the flight yet, in case they head to the airport. So that we can
switch gears if we need to. I agree. Okay. Let's go. Should we see
where they're going? I think, well, we want to
go that way regardless. We want to take a flight—
To be honest, I think actually we
should do the challenges. Because this game is a bit
like investing in returns, in the sense that we need
more money up front to get more money as we go. Okay, so if we were
to do a challenge now, we would do the food one? Yeah, I think that's probably
the easiest to do right here. Okay. Pretty high chance that
that's what they're doing too. As we're heading
towards the train, we also found another really good flight
to Hobart, Tasmania. Flights to Hobart
are not super common, so that could be a good get for us. (sighs) Yeah.
Is it cheap? It's super cheap. It's $258. That could be
pretty big for us. But my worry is that
they're gonna figure that out. I think we should
go to the airport and try to see if they're doing it. Yeah, let's just
get to the airport. So, we're trying to
go to a convenience store? I think so.
Before we go in, we have to decide
how much we want to stake. Oh, oh, yeah. The multiplier is 1.5. Okay, let me do
a little calculation. Before Toby and I
make our wager, let's quickly explain
this challenge. We have to buy five
iconic Australian foods and then feed them in one bite to your blindfolded partner, who must then identify
which three foods they ate. What probability of success
do you think we have? I feel relatively
optimistic about success. Are you confident? I think I could do it. How— How could you
mess this up? Although it's all in one bite. I don't know.
Yeah, all in one bite. But you can't say ""how could
we mess this up"", Toby. 'Cause then we always cut
to directly us messing it up. How could we
possibly mess this up? It's recommending we bet
25% of our wealth, $250. Really? That does
seem low to me. How about
meet in the middle, $300? Okay.
$300, lock it in. Oh, there. Sirena tuna. Tim Tams. Vegemite. (indistinct) I was about to leave. Goodness me, we've made it. I don't know what
Ben and Adam are doing. We gotta go quick
in case they're trying this too. Okay. Intercity and regional
New South Wales services and live rail services. You ever watch that video of the kangaroo putting
the dog in a chokehold? No.
And you can see its big bi— It's crazy. This is a thing that
kangaroos just do. Why would a kangaroo do that? They— I don't— 'Cause they've got
those big biceps. No, I know that
they can do it, but why? They hate dogs. I have to feed you
all three in one bite after you're blindfolded. I'm generating
the numbers, Toby. The first one is... The second one is... Third one is... Working on it, Toby. Uughh! Mmmhmh. Okay, Toby, eyes closed. You just have to eat that, and you're not— eyes closed! My eyes are closed! I mean, look, the best case
scenario for us here is that they attempt a challenge, they take a long time
setting it up, and then they fail it. Yeah. 'Cause here's the thing
about challenges. And this is really
important to emphasize. It's not always good
to do a challenge. No. Because you might lose money.
Yeah. One bite, everyone
knows the rules. (shudders) It's an interesting flavor,
isn't it? (wheezes) You look concerned. (full mouth)
I don't know. I don't— I don't know. Mmh. (mouth clearing)
Mh, okay. Caramello Koala. That's one. Tuna. That's two. Vegemite. Yes, Toby, let's go! There we go. The Vegemite was the one
that got overpowered by tuna. Yeah, that makes sense. Because it just all tasted
like tuna on chocolate. Right. Oh, that's such
a good start. Okay. Okay, well, so
they did the taste test. Okay, looks like they bet $300,
and they succeeded. They made $150.
They made $150. $150 profit. I mean, that's not—
I'm gonna be honest. That's not moving
the needle very much. No, that doesn't do a lot. If I were them,
I would've bet more. That doesn't worry me. It's hardly worth your time. As Shania Twain once said,
that don't impress me much. No, that don't
impress me much. That don't impress me much. That... don't impress me much. Time to transfer. I've never seen
a flight this cheap to Tasmania from Sydney
in any of the... game simulations
we did before this. It must just be so last minute
and basically empty. Yeah. Let's just take advantage. Pricing error? There's been a pricing error. You click on it. Pricing error. Let's just ask. Let's ask at the airport. (sighs) Okay. It's not good. No, it's not great. Okay, let's look
at the challenges. The challenges left are
the AFL goal in Redfern. I don't think we want to do that.
No. Luna Park isn't open until 10.
Okay. So that only leaves
the rock carvings. Let's do the rock carving. This spot, where this is,
is so scenic. Should we head to Bondi Junction
Alright, let's go. And then we'll
have to get on a bus. Trains! This is so exciting. Okay. Are we on the right train? Probably. Alright, okay. Welcome to the airport. Seemingly, there are some
discrepancies with flight prices. So we're gonna go— Okay, wait, but now it's back. Now it says it should be $319. Look, we're just—
Let's go in person and see what the
cheapest, earliest flight we can get to
somewhere else is. Things always go better
when you ask in person. Sometimes. Can I help you? Yes, hi. We were trying to book
on the 10 am to Hobart. And on Google, it said that
it had some really cheap fares. But then when we tried to
book it, it wasn't working. I know sometimes it shows 'booking through a
third party', but it doesn't. It shows on there,
'booking through Virgin'. Which is strange. Yeah, it's weird, isn't it? Wow, thank you so much.
Thank you so much. Oh, that could be big for us. Yeah, of course. Let's see, where are they? They're going to the rocks. Alright, so I think
we need to look for a grocery store or something where we could get
scissors or a knife. Make a rock engraving at the
indigenous rock engravings. Visit the indigenous rock
engravings by North Bondi. Generate a random animal
from the list provided and carve it into a rock
that no one cares about. The other team member must guess the animal
correctly on their first try. Before we buy anything, we need to decide
how much we're staking. How are you feeling
on your riskiness scaled? I think it's not too bad
to be risky now. I guess that's true,
because now is the time we have to come back
from failure. Yeah, but how are you
feeling about your carving ability? If you're feeling good,
I'll go $500. I'm not good about
my arts and crafts. If you're feeling very unsure,
I'd go $400. I'd— I'm comfortable
with $400. Mitre 10's got our back. Oh yeah, they'll have some. Let's go get the bus. Love a good articulated bus. There you go.
All done, guys. Thank you so much. Wow.
Bless your heart. Thank you, Marissa. Thank you.
That's alright. Enjoy. Hehehe-eee!
(paper flapping) Alright, let's get
on our flight. Wheee! (blubbers) And while
you're on your phone, give us an update on
Ben and Adam. So they spent... $288. So it sounds like
they got $144 each? Where could they be
going for that cheap? Hello, how's it going?
Hello. Ben, we've done it. We've done it. Welcome to Bondi. Welcome to Bondi Beach. I feel like this is one of
the most quintessentially— Where are you going?
You're walking in the middle of the road. Okay. So we are looking for the
indigenous rock carvings, which should be
right on the coast here. This is... the Atlantic Ocean. Oh... The things. It is— Those are— From the oldest
culture in the world. They are properly carved.
That's what I'll say. Definitely. I'm surprised how deep it is. But now we need
to do our own. Can we clarify
we ain't carving this? No, we are not carving
into the ancient rock carvings. We are finding a loose rock. And then we are carving. Make sure you get
the best rock. This one's decent. This is a brick. Ooh. It's a pretty—
Yeah, no, I like that. That's a canvas. Alright. Toby?
Yes? I think it's time. I'll go for a walk. See ya. Alright, what animal
we get is crucial to whether or not
this is gonna be easy. 13. Okay, let's see. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Yes, okay. That's gotta be easy. Let's see how this works. (metal-on-rock scraping) Alright, Ben, it looks like
they are at the rock carvings. Yeah, I mean,
we just have to hope that they're not
very good at drawing. I think there's a good chance
they could fail that one. That would rock if they did. That would—
Hey, that would rock. Heyyy! (scraping continues) (blows hard) I don't know
what more I can do. I'm trying not to
overthink this, but... I think this is it. Okay. Hopefully you can see that. That's pretty clear. I think we're ready. Toby?
Yeah? I know that might
seem quick, but I'm ready. Oh dear. (mutters hesitantly) Something comes to mind. Something definitely
comes to mind. No, we've got to go for... giraffe. Lock it in. Congratulations, Toby. You're now the proud
owner of 600 new dollars. Success. I like it.
You did really well. Thank you.
And that took no time at all. Then let's go.
We're cruising. We'll leave this here
for the next person. Let's return it
to our natural habitat. And then let's figure out
our next move. We could actually go
to Luna Park, by the way. Yeah, no,
it's worth considering. It's in the city center,
so once we're there... it's not much of
a waste of time to go ahead and do it.
Mhm. Let's walk and talk. Let's make moves
towards Luna Park. Yeah, let's go back
towards the city. Yeah. Hi, to Bondi Junction? Bye, Bondi. Interesting. Interesting, interesting. It kind of looks like they
might be on a flight... to Hobart. Sydney to Hobart? Well, to be honest, if there was a crazy
good deal to Hobart... Mhm. It would make sense.
Yeah. Hobart would be
a big play. It's a surprising opening move. How do you feel
about carnival games? I don't have
a good track record of hand-eye coordination
challenges. In fact, what Ben and Adam
could put right here is a supercut of me trying to
knock an apple off of Ben's head. Oh no! Oh, that— Noooo— Oh, it— (grimaces) Auunngh! Luna Park. We actually go—
We go down here. We don't go
through the massive sign that says 'Luna Park'? Do you know about the
horrors of Sydn— Luna Park? I feel like the
horrors of Luna Park is about— is what's
about to happen. Man, that's quite an
iconic view. Wait! Alright, Toby, do you have
the challenge list? I was just gonna pull it up. Win a carnival game
at Luna Park. You have $20 worth of
attempts to win a prize at any of the carnival games
that only have one prize tier: buckets, backboard,
basketball, or cans. There's buckets.
What was— Buckets, backboard,
basketball, cans. I'm pretty sure
this is buckets. Okay, okay, okay. (sighs) Alright, well we
bought the in-flight Wi-Fi, so we know that they
are at Luna Park. Those games are—
They're hard. They're designed
for you to lose. They're hard. I think the carnies are gonna
take their money and run. Should I ask him what the
chances are of winning buckets? (indistinct) No, we were wondering
how likely it is to win a prize. On a scale of
one to ten, it's a six. A six out of ten?
I don't lie. Are you easier than backboard? If you can win this,
you can win this. Basketball? There is basketball,
but you cannot win it. It's the hardest game.
It's the hardest game? Okay. I'd say we give this a shot. We should give this a shot. Yeah.
Yeah. We get $20 worth. Yeah, which is five.
Which is five games, yeah. Okay—
Seven games. (indistinct) Oh, thank you. Yes, thank you.
Okay. We have to put— We had to lock in our wage. Oh, yeah, yeah.
What do you want to wager? $1,000? $750? Do you want to go that much? Let's say, okay, $500. $500.
$500. I wanna do more. $500. Okay, $500?
Okay. (sighs) They've put down
$500 on that contract. This I think is a
pretty important moment. If they blow it... Then they'll have lost
a lot of their progress. They'll be almost
back to where they started. But if they hit... They'll have a lot of cash. We'll see. We'll see.
We'll see. And then put
the balls in the basket. Okay. Just make sure you
don't cross the line, okay? Try not to hit the back, okay? Because if you hit the back... Yeah.
It will come out. I feel like I— Yeah,
I have to be gentle, right? Yes.
Okay. And the thing is,
if you want to win... try hitting the rims of the basket. The rims, okay. This is the spot. Ahp— I wanted to be—
It's okay, practice shot. I was trying to be too gentle. (silly grumbles) Sam?
Do you wanna give it a shot? Okay, okay,
I'll give it a shot. (grunts) Mmh.
You have to— You want me to try again? Go insanely gentle
and then make it gentler. That's number one down.
Only one more. Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes. Even gentler.
(giggles nervously) (both grunt)
Okay, that was close. I feel good about
the technique though. What was that?
That was four? Yes. So three more. You've done it once, right? Reproduce that. Oh man. So wait, two more times? Yes. Wait, I can give you
a better one. Better basket? That's number one.
Yes! Okay, one more, yeah. Do the same thing again. Ohh! Alright, last one. (grumbles) Oh, man. Okay. He was so friendly! I got my hopes up.
He was. I think he felt bad.
He gave us extras. Yikes! It's fine. It's fine. That's— That's— It's fine. Ben, they've left Luna Park ...and they're still $-500. I think that they—
I think that they blew it. Look, they flew a
little too close to the sun. And by the sun, I mean the... The carny games at Luna Park.
Carny games at Luna Park. They flew too close
to those and they lost. I wonder which one they did. I bet they did the thing where
you throw the thing in the bucket. It looks really easy. It looks easy. That's how they
make all their money. That's true. That's gotta hoit.
That's gotta hoit! Sorry. Ooh. (grimaces) No, okay, okay. Moving on.
We're moving on. We don't want to do AFL. So the only question now is... where do we go? So there's not really a
great Melbourne option. Yeah, honestly,
Melbourne flights are expensive. Adelaide, kinda similar deal. We could go to Gold Coast
for really cheap. There's cheap flights to Gold Coast at pretty much any time.
Okay. I'd like to do that
if they haven't gone there. I think Gold Coast is
a good place to be. Alright, we have
10 minutes until the next ferry. So we got a quick snack. I wanted to talk to you
about an edge case. We're going to Gold Coast.
Yeah, this is interesting. The Gold Coast Airport appears to be pretty much
on the border between Queensland
and New South Wales. Are you aware of this? I am now. And you can claim
regions in this game by being anywhere,
I believe, in the state, yes? Yeah. Would it be good to
keep that in our pocket as an idea, if at
the end of the game, we wanted to end at, say,
the Gold Coast Airport and quickly toggle between
New South Wales and Queensland? Yeah. Go have a look on the map. Oh yeah, the border goes It's literally on the border.
through the runway. Yeah, it's a good thought. I don't know if they know that. It never came up in game design. Mhm. So that could be
an interesting strat. That could be an exploit.
Yeah. This park may have
stolen $500 from me. Well, not stolen, but... took away $500 from me. This pretzel. This pretzel is pretty... you know,
as the kids say, Toby, GOATed with the sauce. What? This is transport mode
number four of the day. It's pretty good. You count feet, and we're
about to hit number five. Three minutes, we're fine. Let's see if they've... gotten back down to land yet. Ohh— Look at that.
One minute. Oh my god! Hobart International Airport. Oh my god. Why are they doing that? Welcome to Hobart. Welcome to Hobart. Welcome to Hobart.
We've made it. We've made it to... Tassie. That's what we learned... We learned it's called Tassie.
is what we can call it. Let's update our budget
with the welcome bonus. Is that the SkyBus?
It could be. Where do we think
the SkyBus goes? Where does the bus go?
Where does it end? End of the city.
Where are you going to? We're going to the Cenotaph. Cenotaph?
Yeah. Stop one, and there's just
a short walk up to the Cenotaph. Fantastic.
Perfect. Perfect. We're saving money
and we're saving the planet. This is great news. Look, you know,
as far as I'm concerned, 10 out of 10
public transit in Hobart. So far,
everything's gone great. Have fun at Hobart, guys. Melbourne is wide open. Yep. I like Melbourne,
but you know, Gold Coast, also wide open. Very cheap flight.
Happy to go for either. Let's go with the soonest flight. Which is Gold Coast. Okay.
Okay. Okay, based on how
expensive their flight was, they're on the 1:20
to the Gold Coast. That's good news for us. Yeah, because it means that whether we go to Melbourne
or Adelaide after this, they probably won't
be there either way. Yeah. I mean, that means that
we can kind of like... hopefully dominate
the south of Australia and really lock those regions in. That would be really good for us. Certainly would be good. Look at this! I mean, I'm charmed
by this whole place, even though the couple of facts that the guy gave us
on the bus were that the bridge
collapsed and killed everyone, and that a woman is
in charge, and... He seemed to be
dissatisfied with that. It's true. Yeah, they were not
good fun facts, but this is a fun town. There's the Cenotaph. What is a cenotaph? I have no idea
what a cenotaph is. I love cenotaphs. I hope it's not
a (bleep)-ed up thing. Yeah, that'd be bad. Welcome to the Cenotaph. Now we can check
the Challenge Board. Adam, I am in the
right emotional headspace to receive this information. Alright, challenge one. Read signal flags at
Mount Nelson Signal Station. Okay.
So we'd have to go there, make signal flags, and signal
a word to the other one. Okay, okay. That's a 2x. Create a traditional
Tasmanian kelp basket. That's a 2x.
Okay. (snickers)
Throw shrimp on the Barbie. We have 100 tries to
throw shrimp onto a Barbie doll from
a distance of 30 feet. (chuckles) It's risky. And ""That's not a knife"". You have to cut a
Tim Tam in half longways with something
that is not a knife. A great reference to... Crocodile Dundee.
Crocodile Dundee. That's a 2x, okay. So we've got
three 2x's and one 3x. Well, here's
what I'll say, in general. Here's the thing about Tassie. The great state of Tassie. I – and this is not a
slight to this place – but I do not wanna
have to come back here. No, and I don't want
them to come here at all. So, I think
that before we leave, we want to put down
an amount of money that is gonna deter them
from ever coming here. So we can just lock it up. Because it's not easy
to get here, and it would be hard
if we had to come back. Yes. I think the only
question left is... how much do we want to
leave in New South Wales? I think we think that
if we ever want to win this, we're probably going
to have to be back. I don't think
we can lock it up. I would only do $250. Mmh... I feel more like $500 or so. Even if we think we're
going to have to come back... We'll be back
for sure to Sydney. In an ideal version of this game, we would have $5,000
on the last day or more. And we would book
flights to four cities. Four to five cities. Well, we couldn't
make that much. We couldn't travel
that much then anyway. It's possible, I think. Maybe a super optimized route. Yeah.
We could do three. Oh, we could do at least
four cities on one day. Let's say we put,
you know, $375 or $400. Then I think we still have so much to play with
in Queensland. Yeah, that sounds good to me. We can do $400. $400? Lock it in? Yeah. You want to press the button? It's right there.
This button. Actually, I don't know
if we can afford buttons. I don't know. I don't want to commit to that. We'll press the
metaphorical button Okay.
to lock it in. Good?
Yep. Any other words for the camera? So, shrimp on the
Barbie is definitely not safe. No, that feels
very risky to me. I think the Tim Tam
is also not safe at all. I think... signal station.
I feel like we could do that. As long as we
put in enough time that we are able to
make the flags good. Right. How much do we want to bet? (exhales sharply) Here's what I think, Ben. I think we should
bet the exact amount that would leave us enough that we could get a
flight out of here if we were to fail. That... That would say
we should bet $855. You want to round down
and bet $800? Okay. I think $800. Put down $800. (imitates slot machine pulley) Read signal flags at
Mount Nelson Signal Station. At the historic
Mount Nelson Signal Station, one team member must
create and use signal flags to spell a random 10 letter word, which the other team member
must decode from a distance of 100 feet. Team members may not speak
to each other when signaling, and the signaling may not
last more than 100 seconds. The decoder has one guess. Ugghh, if we fail this,
then it's gonna really suck. It's gonna put us
in a really bad position. That's fine. Let's find a store,
like a general store. First flight of the game. For us at least. Yep. Welcome... to Officeworks. Whee! Yes, they've got... plenty of stuff. I'm gonna leave, you do this. Now that Adam
has left the premises, I can confide in you
what my word is. My word is 'cohabitant'. And we can spell that out
on screen with the flags. And so, I just need
to be able to make... those eight letters. Let's go. Wow. What a view. Welcome to the
Mount Nelson Signal Station, where they used to do... signals.
What is, so tell— What is the history
of this place, Ben? I believe that they would
just signal ships with flags. You can see the flags there. Oh, I see. Lovely. From all the way up here. I'm gonna go there
and make the flags, and you've gotta just go away. Okay. So... We need all of our letters. If we fail this... we are in deep, deep trouble. It's like the flag of... Poland? I wonder how Poland
feels about that. Or maybe this isn't
the flag of Poland. What is the flag of Poland? Comment below... about what the flag of Poland is. Okay, let's go get Adam. Adam! Camera, I'm gonna
hand you over to Adam. Alright, we're going. Alright. Alright, that very clearly
seems to be a C. That's an O. H. A. B. I. That's a T. A. N. T. Ben... Was the word 'cohabitant'? Yes. Yeah! Okay, so, it's 2:30. There's a flight that we
want to get on at 6:30. The 6:30 to Adelaide? I mean, I continue to
really like that flight. I mean, I'm of— I'm of half a mind to
just go ahead and book it. I think priority—
I don't see a situation where we don't want
to take that flight. I mean, the only situation
would be if they went to Adelaide, which wouldn't make any sense.
Actually, we should check on them. There's a bus
leaving in one minute. That is gonna make
a 30-minute difference, but I don't think we'll get to it. No, no, that's the one. That was it. Yeah. Wonder if they... Damn it. Yep, found it. Damn it. Well... we went as fast as we could. Well, on the plus side... I think there's some devastating
news from Ben and Adam, which is that I changed the budget. That's not the plus side. Ben, we are
booked to Adelaide. Alright, you know,
three regions on day one? That's not bad. It's not bad at all. We still have to earn some
more money before we leave, because I think
we want to put down as much as we can here. I mean, the one that
really kind of calls to me is the Barbie one. I just, it's a 3x. 3x, yeah.
You get 100 tries. But it's 3x, 'cause it's risky. How far is 30 feet? I'm gonna measure. You go be the Barbie. A hundred tries? A hundred? Okay. Holy (bleep) There's a wallaby
down there. (whispering)
Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, that is a wallaby, Ben. (whispering)
That's totally a wallaby. Yeah, yeah, come on. (room volume)
It's just a little guy. Shhh. (whispering)
It's just a sweet little guy. Hello, little guy. Hello. He's looking right at us, Ben. (squeakily)
Look at that guy. (whispering)
Oh, there he goes. (softly)
Look at it hop. That was awesome. That was awesome
what just happened. Bad news. Eh, ah... What are their names?
Ben and Adam seemingly completed the
challenge successfully and wagered quite a lot on it. So they are up for claim... They're up. They're up.
Terrible news. Good news...
Good news, weather. The weather's nice.
Very nice day. The weather is nice.
Good news to us. Bad news...? Bad news? Climate change. Good news...? Global child poverty
is at a near historic low. That's great news. Bad news...? I guess it's
only good news then. So I imagine, Toby, it has crossed your mind
that this season is all about... evaluating risk. Which is kind of exactly
what won us last season. I hate to say it, but... I do think there are
some common themes there in the sense that... Adam and Ben
might think things are easier than they really are.
Yeah. They are often,
I think, overconfident. I just feel like with
100 tries, with 100 tries, surely you could land
a shrimp on the Barbie. Regardless,
if we're gonna do it, we gotta do it soon. (sighs heavily) I think... put in $800... and we do it right now. Alright, alright. Here we go. (pew) $800 in shrimp on a Barbie. Okay, there's a Target nearby
that should have Barbies. I don't know if it'll have shrimp. Target. Alright, lots of Barbies. We just want the Barbie
with the most volume. This Barbie—
That's a solid Barbie. It's a big dress that
the shrimp could get caught in. Right, right. I like that. I think we need the
A Touch of Magic Barbie. Absolutely. Now the question is, how large of a shrimp
can you find? Alright, Adam,
keep your eyes peeled for the biggest shrimp
you've ever seen. Oh, baby! (laughs) I mean, these shrimp
are pretty big. And they've got
lots of legs and stuff. Thank you.
Thank you. Okay, yeah, this park
looks like it would be good for throwing shrimp. Now there's a question of
how we want to position the Barbie. I think sitting up, legs spread, such that it'll sort of
serve as a backboard. Yeah. This is shrimp number one. Shrimp one. Hold on.
Some of the— I'm gonna cut in,
you know, sort of action shot. Yeah, yeah.
We got our... nice, juicy guy. Alright, this is
gonna teach us a lot, I think, this first attempt. Yep. Okay. Oh—! Did it land on it? It hit the Barbie,
but it is not touching. Oh, there is a seagull
who's eyeing the shrimp. I'm gonna have to defend
the shrimps as well. Oh, that was close. That's real close, but still... No cigar. Okay, I'm getting
worse at it, Ben. Let's go! Close, close. Take your time with them. We got time, we got time. Now, now I'm
getting more nervous. I think, to be honest, I think they're going to play this higher risk, higher reward
than we are. Which can work out. But it can also not. Yeah, you need
some amount of risk in this game, for sure. I don't know
what will work out. Yeah, I guess,
I would definitely say my attitude to the
challenges is sceptical. Alright, zen, zen mode. Let the Barbie come
to the shrimp. No. Oh, that one. Okay, I'm not gonna panic yet. Oh—! Is that on the Barbie? Yes. Ohoho, baby!
Hit it! (growls) Let's go! Let's goooo! Check that out. I think that's unquestionable. (laughs)
That's unquestionable evidence. (pshooh!) So we're now theoretically going to have to wait
here for 25 minutes. It's taking a while to
get us into the Gold Coast. Oh, wait. Oh, they just... Oh. Earned... $2.4k? That is...
That's a lot of money, yeah. I wonder what that was. 3x multiplier? A 3x multiplier,
and they put... $800 into it? But they didn't
even have very much. Not ideal. Not ideal. But, okay. The thing that is
worth noting is... they're playing really
high risk, high reward. So... Yeah, the fact that
they got $2,400... Highly concerning. Highly concerning. Makes me think we want to
maybe ramp up our riskiness. Mhm. Alright, we'll get
to the Challenge Board, see what we got,
and then see what's next. I'm freaking out.
(laughs) I'm gonna die. Are we going all in? Is this the riskiest thing
we've ever done on Jet Lag: The Game? Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus We are so frickin' back! It's— No one can deny
that we're back. Yeah, and did you know
that that episode, episode 2 of this season, you can watch it
right this very instant on nebula.tv. Nebula.com.
Nebula.tv. No, watchnebula.com
or nebula.tv. Yeah, Ben, say words. What's even better:
nebula.tv/jetlag. Another thing that you get
with your Nebula subscription is access to The Layover, which is our aftershow podcast where we break down
the episode with Toby. Toby's gonna be on this season. And we go into all the
behind the scenes, game design,
all the stuff that happened that you didn't see. So if you're interested in
getting more out of the season, The Layover is the
best way to do it. Truly one of the
podcasts of all time. And Nebula is just
a great service otherwise. If you don't know about it,
Nebula is a creator-owned and creator-founded
and creator-run and audience-supported
streaming service. And it has all kinds of Originals from a lot of your
favorite creators. You also often get access
to their YouTube videos early and ad-free. Every episode of Jet Lag
goes up one week early. We also post an outtakes
and cut-for-time episode at the end of every season there. And most importantly, when you go to Nebula and
you sign up with our code... you are helping support the show. We get a portion of
your subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed. And also with our code,
it's a good deal for you because it's only $30 for the year. And I really want to emphasize. A lot of people get confused,
and they think it's $30 a month. And it's not.
It's $30 for the year, which nets out to $2.50 a month. Which is like, you know, not— It's like, I feel like
that's a reasonable amount for access to all of those things. That's less than a train fare. It's so much less than
it costs to go on a train. That's true!
Yeah. In New York City, at least. Anyways but the thing to focus on is that right now, if you don't
have a Nebula subscription, you have nothing to do or watch. And that's bad.
(wheezes) Your life sucks. Yeah, but if you do have
a Nebula subscription, you can watch
season 10, episode 2 of Jet Lag this very second! Oh my god,
your life is awesome. Yeah, so good. Yes! And all you gotta do
is go to nebula.tv/jetlag to sign up, get that 40% off. And thank you for your support. And thank you
for your support. I was trying to say it
to somebody else. Oh, that's nice. Good bye!"

to the finale of hide-and-seek
across Switzerland. Right now, there's one day left, which means Adam has
just enough time to potentially pull back
and win the whole thing. If he can beat Ben's
9 hour and 36 minutes, he'll secure first place
right before the final day ends. That might be a tall order,
but Adam has a plan that relies on exactly where
he placed his hiding zone, a plan we'll learn more about later. For now, let's return to
the woods in Winterthur, where Ben and I are about
to start our final day. Hello. It's 7:30 am... and we are... so frickin' back! But we gotta go. It's 7:30. We gotta catch Adam. Yeah, let's get
to the train station. Let's go. So here's the thing. It is extremely inconvenient. I mean, this was my goal to get from this part
of the city to downtown. It's almost an hour-long walk, but there's a train from
Töss Station at 7:51. We should be able to
make that if we're quick. I just have to
not break my leg. Yeah, are you...
Okay, yeah. I'm so not
breaking my leg, Sam. Okay, but you know
there's branches sticking out. I don't care.
No, Ben. My legs are stronger than that. Good morning! It is the final day. Oh man, I'm nervous. (sighs) I did something kinda
high risk, high reward. Ohh, we'll see if it worked. We need to
ask some questions. So, I think we almost certainly
want to do the rhyme thing. Because it seems like that's the
best opening strat regardless. It's a very useful question. But I think it might make sense to ask pretty early the
same canton question. I agree.
I think there's a decent chance
he's around Zürich. Yeah, and even
if he's not— Uh-oh. Even if he's not, excluding the Zürich Canton,
which is pretty big, would be pretty useful for us. I mean, the direction
might be Zürich regardless, but okay, let me at least
fire off the rhyme. Okay, fire off the rhyme. I think we're
in a good position. I agree. So, alright, let me
figure out the fastest route to Zürich Hauptbahnhof. Alright, well... They have bought
the rhymes. This is good. This is part of the plan. Ohh, I hope this works. It is Intern—
Oh, that's you. Awh. Sin, Flock, Zuckerberg. I almost put
Zuckerberg yesterday. I know what
rhyme calculator he's using. And Skill. That suggests to me that
he is in a German area, but... Or...
Maybe he's trying to trick us. Yeah, it'd be very hard for him
to get outside of the German area. Not impossible,
but it'd be very difficult. Should we fire off
same canton? Let's do.
If he is near Zürich, it's gonna be a huge headache. Gonna be a bloodbath. And I say that as someone
who did that strat. (chuckles)
Yeah. We'll see. Okay, so they've asked
if I'm in the same canton. I'm not. I guess that's a
solid question at this point. If they know that I'm
not in Zürich at all, then that gets rid of
the densest, or one of the densest areas. On the other hand, though, given that I'm not
in the Zürich Canton... I mean, it means
I could still be in a whole lot of cantons, so... Oh, it's a no. Adam is not in
the Zürich Canton, so that means that he went
a decent ways from here. Yeah, which makes sense, but there are only so many
decent ways he could get. He could have gone
towards Basel. He could have gone
towards Bern. He could have gone
to Lucerne. Could have gone to Lucerne. Could have gone to St. Gallen. That would be the main curveball. Is there... a way that we
can ask a question that will give us
a direction to go? I mean, considering he's
not in the Zürich Canton, I don't think Zürich would
make a huge difference if we did— if we figured out whether he was
east or west of us. (sighs) I mean, but
east or west would really only exclude St. Gallen. Yeah, but that's a—
There's plenty over there. And it would make sense,
because it's kind of a... It's a bit of a curveball.
convoluted corner. Yeah, but everything else is west. There's got to be a better
question we can ask. But we're gonna want to
do east–west eventually, right? Yeah, but it's—
The thing is that question is useful anytime. It really is.
Yes, but we need direction. We do, but
I think that there are other ways we can get direction. Okay. Alright, train's here. I'm gonna venture a guess that their leading theory is that
I'm somewhere outside of Bern. And I am. So they're right, but... I don't think I'm
the place outside of Bern where they would think. Still going to Zürich
because it's still a big hub, and it's still probably
in his direction. Here's a suggestion. So if we do a 50-mile radar, that would include
everything east of us that he could reasonably get to... but it would exclude Bern ...and all of that area
to the west that he could get to pretty quickly. Because that's the
high-speed line. Basel would be excluded, barely. And Bern would be excluded. But we'd want to hit it now and not—
Before we go to Zürich. Before we go to Zürich. The train leaves now,
so we gotta... Yeah, hit the 50-mile radius. Okay. Alright. A 50-mile radar. I would say that that is
somewhat unfortunate. Because I don't think I'm in it. Nope. And that does really
limit the possibilities. Ah, shoot, yeah. That was probably
a smart move. Alright, Sam,
what do you think? Is it going to be a hit or a miss? We just got it. We just got it?
What is it? Miss. That, okay, well, now I— It's going to look like I'm lying, but my guess
was going to be miss. The highest-speed line
in the country is the one that goes
Zürich, Bern, Geneva. Yeah, and he couldn't have
gotten as far as Geneva, but he could have gotten
to Bern. My guess is that
he went to Bern. 'Cause it was the furthest— It was the fastest
he could get that far. Yep. Do we want to do
anything in Zürich? Or just head straight to Bern? I mean, if he's
not within 50 miles... Probably not, yeah. Okay, let me check what the fastest
transfer is going to be. We're alright. Just barely made the train. Let's go this way. It looks like they're
headed to Bern, which... I mean, in fairness,
it's pretty obvious that I am somewhere... in the broad vicinity
of Bern. Now, I knew that
they would figure out that I was somewhere
in the Bern region-ish pretty quickly. So the plan accounts for that. I wasn't just expecting that they would never
figure that out. I will say they figured
it out a little faster and a little more cheaply
than I would have liked. Ben, this is so fun. Yes, we are on our way. While we're sideways.
We're sideways. It's fun that we're sideways. It's so fun that we're sideways.
Normally they're not sideways. And that's what fun is. It's when something is
different than it normally is. Now would be a good time to ask for a photo
if we wanted to. Yeah, I mean the train station
one could be good. I mean— I feel like we want that
at some point regardless. That one is a great— It's just a good verification tool, and it'll be useful later, and
it might tell us something now. Yeah.
So... What do you think, fire it off? I think let's just fire it off
while we're on our way. I'm into it. I mean,
we're racking up coins, but I think we're – at least for a little while –
going to be in an area where we can respond
to a curse pretty well. Yeah, I'm not too worried yet. Alright, the next part
of the game is the key part. Just really need them
to have a bad middle game. (growls hesitantly) Alright, they want a photo
of the train station. But that is fine. Oh, my legs are so tired. I mean, I think just a picture of... this... would probably work. Shoot. (camera click) Well, I hope that
there aren't pictures that show that graffiti. Okay, okay,
we've got the photo. That could be anywhere. I mean, there's
the same graffiti. Yeah, well, I mean,
we'll be able to spot it. I just don't think we can
learn a ton from that, because... I think that could be
big city, small. Good job, Adam. (faint ringing) Why is someone
ringing a bell? What's going on? Whoa, it's sheep. Hello. Oh, it's the sheep's bell. The sheep was ringing the bell. Great work! Or goats, maybe? Are you a goat? Ram, potentially? Okay. Welcome... to Bern. Welcome to Bern. Let's... Bern his chances
of victory to the ground. Ohh! Hey!
You like that? Yeah, that's pretty good. Thank you. Yeah, so we're thinking
a 10-mile radius just to see if he's here or in any of the
surrounding towns. Because if he's not... the remaining options
are pretty limited. Sending it. (inhales sharply) Okay, 10-mile radar. Not great. So I'm not within
10 miles of them. But knowing that... means they can rule out
a ton of the complexity. Oh, is this car
gonna try to— No. I was really hoping that they were gonna go
for a 5-mile radar. Because... that would still kind of
leave in the outskirts of Bern. I think their best next question
is probably a latitude. So let's hope they don't ask that. Look at... Look at Bern. Does it have a particular
thing that it's known for? Vibes? Seems like it's kind of
the whole country. Yeah, except for Winterthur. Except for Winterthur. Ooh. What? It's a miss.
It's a miss. Okay, okay. He still could have come here and then gone somewhere... He could have.
Connected. But he only would've had
about 30 minutes once getting here. We could ask if he is
north or south of us. We could also ask if he's
east or west of us. Yeah, if he is
anywhere east of us, that would narrow down
options pretty quick because of that radius
that we have around Winterthur. So there's very few places that would be east of us and that he theoretically
could have gotten to. Well, he also just
couldn't have gotten that far west of us. No, so I guess it would
narrow down options a good bit. But it is expensive. I think at this point... We're gonna need it. We're gonna need
something big. Okay, east–west? (hesitates) ...Yeah. Ah, shoot. Longitude. So I'm east of them. Ugggh. The possibilities start
to get really limited thanks to that
50-mile radar, I think, and the 10-mile. We start to be dealing
with a pretty tight region. He's east of us. Okay. There's a stretch
of towns right here. I think we've sort of got... Like a band. Again, unless we are really... Whiffing it.
Whiffing it. Yeah. Which we may be. Very possible. I think there's a band
of towns that he could be in. And it's here. Well, is there something
that could confirm that? One thing we could maybe do... is we could drop
a 25-mile radius. Mhm. If the 25 is a no,
that cuts off pretty much everything
except for... Yeah, except for the stuff
right outside of Basel. I think at that point, we would just have to
probably assume he went to Basel. But I think considering
that takes an hour, it makes sense
to use the coins and use that to...
to confirm. I don't love it, but... I don't love it either.
I don't love it either. He's not making this easy for us. I think it's
probably the best option. I think we've got to do
a 25-mile radius from here. Because if it's a yes,
then we've got a donut. Yeah, if it's a yes,
that's very useful. If it's a no, we have a problem. This is a critical one.
Ohh, Adam! Why are you doing this
to us, Adam? This is too hard. You picked a place
that's too hard. I'm sure he's feeling... great right now. We are not going
to let you beat us. We are going to find you. So, to me... This seems like a good sign that they are confused. There's a 25-mile radar. I am within 25 miles of them. I think that's a good sign? I'm gonna say I'm cautiously
optimistic about that. Okay, hello. This is interesting. We've got an answer. And it's the most
interesting answer. It's a hit.
It's a hit. So that means that he is
within 25 miles of us, but not 10 miles of us. We have a Target logo. Yeah.
Not sponsored. And in fact—
We have a Lyme disease bite. Well, not even. We have half a Lyme disease bite. It's like if a tick bit you, and then half your arm fell off. Oh, like the inside?
Because we've also split Like a cross-section
of your arm. Yeah, no. Because we've split— We've done the longitude as well. Oh, so it's like, okay, so it's like you slice
your arm in half. Yeah. And then you
slice it this way too. The tick has bit you here. So... Theoretically... hopefully... around now is when
my plan should start... really working. Right about now, hopefully, they should be making a list of all the places where
they think I could be. And hopefully... where I actually am
is not on it. (chants, knocking rail)
Research, research, research. We should be
able to figure out... down to a few towns,
where he is based on this. So let's fire off...
I agree. Do you want to do—
Wait. Do you want to do a
research montage? Research montage...
Let's go! Yeah, Moutier's too far. The one that goes
through Biberist, right? He couldn't have gotten
to Thun or Steffisburg. Anything before Buchli
on that line is fair game. Oberdorf, excluded. That whole line, excluded. And then there's
all the ones from here. Oof, this is gonna be a
long research montage. Yeah. Okay, this is taking some time because I'm being
so (bleep)-ing methodical. You feel me? I feel you. I think that narrows it down to... honestly, a lot of options
out of Solothurn. So maybe we
should go to Solothurn. Ooh, there's a train
in five minutes. We should try to grab that. Okay, let's see
if we can get that. Okay. Okay, so... Here's what I've done. Assuming we haven't messed up, we've narrowed it down to one, two, three...
four, five, six, seven... eight, nine, ten, eleven... twelve options. Okay. Twelve train stations
that he might be at. Are you also— More train stations. Twelve towns. Well, okay. Twelve towns. Now that the plan
seems to be working... let's reveal what it is. So last night... I took a train,
basically as far as I could. The train got in ten minutes
before my hiding period ended. And then the second
I got off the train, I sprinted into a
different municipality within the zone... of a different train station. A train station that
I could not have gotten to ...on trains ...in time last night. So my hope was, and
seemingly it's working... They have ruled out
where I am because they've looked at it,
and they've been like, ""Well, he couldn't
have gotten there."" And then the train station
that I actually did go to, but I'm not in that
municipality anymore... I did not include a word
that rhymed with it. So they're going to look
at the town that my train arrived in. They're going to say,
""Well, he can't be there. It doesn't rhyme."" But then they're gonna look
at the town that I ran to, and they're going to say,
""Well, he can't be there. He couldn't have gotten there."" But in fact, it turns out
that if you run like a madman and completely destroy your legs... you can get there. So... Cautiously optimistic? We'll see. Alright. We have made it
to Solothurn. We've narrowed
it down to 12 options based on routes that
he could have taken, places that rhyme, that are outside of the radius
that we set to the south. Yeah, let's go up top.
Et cetera. So, while we were on that ride, I went through and checked. Five of those... are outside of
five miles from here. Seven are not. So we can more or less
split our options in half ...if we set a 5-mile radius. This does put him
over 200 coins. It's a bit risky. As long as we
don't get him to... 300, we're fine. ...Yeah. Just, it's fine,
don't worry about it. Alright, should I send it? Send it. Castle! Alright, they have
requested a 5-mile radar. I'll tell them... they missed. Okay. So either we just narrowed—
That's getting messy. Yeah, 'cause either we've
narrowed it down to five... Or... Or he's somewhere else weird. Or we messed up a lot. So, with our options
narrowed down to five, we asked Adam whether
his next train departed at an odd or even time. He answered odd, which eliminated four
of the remaining towns, and left us with just one:
Wiedlisbach. So, assuming we didn't
make any mistakes, we hopped onto the
next train to Wiedlisbach. I'm just really worried that we've whiffed massively and that—
No, it's not possible. Well, it is. We're so good at this. He's gonna be in Wiedlisbach. The problem is that
if we whiffed massively, this will all probably
be edited down massively, because it's gonna be
really boring. Since this next part
is really boring, I'll just give you the gist. We took a quick
15-minute train north before finally arriving
in Wiedlisbach, only to discover that
Wiedlisbach Station didn't match Adam's photo. No, this doesn't feel like it. Well, that sucks. (sighs)
We are... rather confused as to... I'm not surprised that
we got something wrong. But I just have no idea what. I mean, we must have
missed something. At this point,
we had no choice but to go back to the
drawing board, and this was when we realized
we might have been tricked. Looking closer at the map, we saw that one of the towns we had already eliminated
– Bätterkinden – was actually within walking distance,
or running distance, of another town, Utzenstorf. We had assumed that Adam
couldn't be in Utzenstorf because it didn't rhyme with one
of the words he had provided. But if Adam had situated himself so that his hiding zone
overlapped with both towns, he could have answered the
rhyme question in Bätterkinden and then walked to Utzenstorf
to answer the other questions. That would force us to cross off
Bätterkinden as well, and ultimately create
the information profile of a town that didn't exist. If we disregarded the rhyme data, then everything else
matched with Utzenstorf. So, with our new theory in place, we got on a train
back to Solothurn to catch the next train
to Utzenstorf. If it's not this, we must have
messed up somewhere. 'Cause we just have to
mess up once to accidentally exclude
something that we shouldn't have. And that's where he can be. We've checked our work. This, right now, is the only option we've
identified that still works. Yeah. And even this is a tricky one. Yeah. I mean,
he would do tricky. Yeah, that is true. This really
doesn't feel likely. No. It'll be exciting if it is. (chuckles weakly)
That is true. Let's see. Alright, well they're
moving south from Solothurn. Have they figured it out yet? Maybe. Depends on
how far south they go. (sighs) Depends on
how far south they go. Here's something
I just noticed, Ben. What?
The photo. Oh, it's got that same
sort of red thing, doesn't it? So it's definitely an
advertisement like that. Maybe down. I don't know, Ben. No, I don't know either. No... Not here. (growls) Well... he's not in Utzenstorf. But I don't know where he is. Folks, the plan is working. What can I say?
The plan is working. They've ruled out
the place that I'm close to, where my train got in,
because it doesn't rhyme. They've ruled out here, because I don't think they
think I could have gotten here. They simply did not consider... my incredible speed.
(wheezes) Ahh, they did not consider
my incredible speed. We're not
missing a line, right? (sighs) Should we
go through it again? Konolfingen Line excluded. This line, this line,
this line, this line. Could he have
gotten to Oberburg? I think we looked at that. (yawns) Why the (bleep)
did we exclude Bergdorf? 'Cause we don't have Orf. I believe in you. This is not gonna work. Okay, look.
We have a new strategy 'cause we cannot seem to
figure out what town— I mean, we've just looked at
every town a billion times. We cannot figure this out. We must've missed something.
I don't know. Our new strategy is
make Adam do as much (bleep) as we can and hopefully trip up
and give us information about exactly where he is. I think, yeah,
we forget about coin counts. Let him curse us
however much he wants, and just wear him down. At least to... for retribution. We are going to throw
everything that we can at him and... Eventually he'll just— Something might get leaked. Yes.
And we can go get him. I mean, a FaceTime
would be fun. And it's only ten coins. Okay, let's FaceTime him
until he shows us a bird. Maybe we'll see something. Hello, Adam. Hey, fellas. Let's find you guys a bird. Let's find you a
sweet little birdie. I'm looking for birds. We could stay on
this call forever. Ooh, I just saw a bird,
but I don't... I don't think I'm gonna
show you that one. ♪ I'm gonna show you a bird ♪ ♪ It's bird time ♪ ♪ It's bird time ♪ I'm gonna mute Adam. Yeah, yeah. Just wait until
he shows us that bird. I don't wanna hear Adam. I just wanna see a bird.
He's saying a lot of words. I don't know what they mean. Alright, here's our train. We are getting on
this train to Bergdorf because... we just need to get out of here. We just want to go somewhere
more populous and... Yeah, and this is the
last one for half an hour? Yeah. He's still babbling. Adam is still
trying to show us a bird. Adam? Hurry up and show us a bird. Oh, oh guys. There might be some
bird situation happening. You see it? See that bird? I'm gonna hang up on him. Okay, that didn't
end up being very useful. He managed to get
a shot of just the sky. I think I got him
frustrated how much he's got. Well, that's something. I think we need to
ask another question for more spillover info. Yeah, probably a
photo one at this point. Yeah. Maybe a photo of five buildings. Photo of five buildings? Yeah, I think that that... has the best chance of
telling us something. They are giving me coins. I am getting dangerously
high on my coins. Alright, let's find them
some great buildings. I don't think that this is
going to be helpful to them. Okay. Well... We are in Bergdorf,
and we are so very lost. I love Bergdorf. Where you just have
to keep looking at maps and seeing if we
got something wrong. I love looking at maps and
seeing if we got something wrong. I want to get a snack. Okay. What kind of snack, Sam? I don't know, I haven't
tried these things yet. I think it's like a
chocolate chip scone. Me neither. Okay. What about from this angle? With enough of a zoom... I can get to... this. (camera click) I don't think that that's going
to be very helpful to them. Now we got a photo. Not very useful. Yeah, that's a
whole lot of nothing. Alright, what do we
want to make Adam do now? Something. What's the
most annoying thing that we can make Adam do while we keep checking the maps?
Yes, that's what I wanna know. We could make him
run for Strava. Yeah, (bleep) it, make him run. Uuggh! They want me to do
the Strava thing. Ugh, okay. Oh my god,
my legs are so shot. I just... (breathes heavily) Maybe I should just
tell them where I am. Then they'll stop making me... run around. (groans) Keep looking. Sam, keep looking. I don't know,
I've lost in ten minutes. You have to motivate me, Ben. What's in it for me? The glory of helping me win. Hold on. Langenthal. This is what
we might have missed. Where the (bleep)'s that? Langenthal is before... When would he have gone there? Would he have gone through... He would have gone straight
to Langenthal from Winterthur. ...What?! Okay, let me explain. It turns out we missed
an entire line. We had crossed out
the town of Langenthal because, once again, it didn't rhyme with
any of Adam's words, and we thought Adam couldn't
have gotten far enough to reach any of the towns on the line going south
from Langenthal. But it turns out
that if he had taken a different route to Langenthal, going direct from Winterthur
instead of through Bern, he might have just barely had time to reach one of those towns, several of which matched
the rest of our data. So, once again, we gathered up our stuff,
hopped on a train, and made a beeline
straight for Langenthal. Turns out we (bleep)-ed up,
big surprise. Yeah, so the
(bleep)up-am-ometer, is... Well, it's going
down now, I guess. Hopefully.
But it was pretty high. Hopefully, it's going down. I don't know
what direction it's going. Alright, welcome to Langenthal. We are here so that we can
check that very last line ...of towns. I think we
should take this one. This is kind of our... We're so fine. We've had a lot of last hopes, but this is our
last-last hope. We're doing great. The line from Langenthal. Welcome to the Thunderdome. Otherwise known as the
train from Langenthal to... This is the Thunderdome.
Rohrbach. With just enough time
to ride the line once, we checked each station
out the window to see if it matched
Adam's photo, eliminating them one by one. Finally, we arrived at
the last stop, Rohrbach. This isn't looking promising. The last station, Sam. Rohrbach. It's not looking good. I don't think that this
building is gonna match. Anything? Nuh-uh. Well... They still in Burgdorf? No, it isn't. Oh, guys. Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, fellas. Well... I think that's it for us, Sam. (whimpers) I think you brought
supplies for this? Yeah, yeah.
No, we've got... We have emergency
supplies for this. A contingency scenario. Contingency scenario. This is... (cans opening) This is a good idea. Cheers. Prost. It's been real, Ben. We have no leads. The real lesson is if you let someone hide
in an entire country... it can be a little tricky
to find them. We made it work
a couple of times. Yeah, and then
we learned that if you just go to an area
with a (bleep) ton of lines, it starts to get really difficult. Yeah. Yeah, it does. (grunts) The sun is starting to set. That's nice. We can watch it together. That'll be nice. That'll be nice. I think it's time that
we let Adam know that... I'm sure he's
ready to get out of... wherever he is.
Wherever he is. He's been there a while.
Yeah. He didn't have to wait
in the forest, though, like me. Look, Adam... This was... a great hiding place,
wherever it was. Oh, there you are. Hello, gentlemen. Adam, where are you? Well, I'm in beautiful
Steffisburg, of course! Steffisburg? He couldn't have
gotten to Thun? Or Steffisburg? Where's that? We don't even— I thought you couldn't get
to Steffisburg. Well, let me
tell you what happened. Is that last night,
I took a train to Thun, and then I simply ran. That makes sense.
(bleep) To just over the border
in Steffisburg, because it's quite close? Just over the border
of Steffisburg, yeah. I'll see you at
Zürich Flughafen, fellas. Alright, see you at
Zürich Flughafen. Good bye! Good bye. And now, let us
teleport to Zürich. (zap)
Woah! Oh my god, we made
it to the Flughafen. We're back. Hey fellas! It's Adam! Oh my god, he just came here. It's Adam from
Jet Lag: The Game. Adam...
Hello! Adam, how does it feel? How does it feel...
How does what feel? You're about to
get hit by a tram. Oh no! (laughs) Okay, alright. Let's wait... for this guy. Have you heard
this story about his... An old pair squatting with
his family for 11 years? You know about— What? You know about
the German woman who lived in my home
for 11 years. I've told you about this. No! He also said that I knew this. Well, Ben just always says the weirdest (bleep)
that I've ever heard. Right. Well, it's very fitting. It's like an origin story for him letting Europeans
take advantage of him. Woah!
Oh my god! We made it to the Flughafen. It says on the sign. Oh my god, it's Adam! It's Adam Chase
from Jet Lag: The Game. It's Adam from Jet Lag. Hello! It's unbelievable timing. I know!
We just got here. Adam, I would like to now
congratulate you in-person on being the winner of
Jet Lag season 9 Hide + Seek.
Wooooo! Very good stuff.
Very good stuff. (continues cackling)
Ben, you wanna get the thing? Well, okay. Now hold on. Now, while you've been
making your way over here, we've actually had a
little bit of time. I'm— Hold on. Didn't we just apparate here? Well, shut up. Plot hole, but it's fine. (wheels squeaking)
Squeak, squeak, squeak. Oh my gosh! No, no, no, no, no, no. What's that?
It's an oven. Shh!
It's an oven? You can clearly see
it's an oven. That's crazy! It's clearly in
the shape of an oven. It's an oven. Sam. I think the oven's front
is this way? That's correct. Do I want to— I just want to
double check framing that we can see the oven.
Yeah? Okay, yeah, we can
definitely see the oven. (door opening)
(imitates rusty squeaking) Whoa, okay, yep. Now go ahead and pull it out. Ow! It's hot! Yeah, well, it's freshly baked. Ow! Why didn't I wear
an oven mitt? Now, hold on.
Yeah? I've got to go ahead
and frost it. So I'm going to take
my frosting thing. Yeah, I think I'm
holding it this way, so you've got to frost
the front. Woah!
Oh my god, wow. That looks so good, Ben. Yeah?
What am I looking at? You're looking
at the first ever edible Jet Lag: The Game
trophy. It's on theme because despite the fact that this is
coming out months later, it's about to be Christmas. Yeeees! Congratulations, Adam. Go ahead and take a bite.
How is it? How does it taste? Oh, he ate the whole thing
just like that. Oh, oh my, it's all gone. Wow, he was hungry. Oh, we're about to
get hit by a tram again. We're about to be hit
by a tram again. Okay, we're back.
We didn't get hit by a tram. We paused the video. One of our mics died,
and also there was a tram. But we're back. Anyways, Adam, I heard you had some trouble
sleeping this season. That is genuinely true.
Yeah, yeah. Did you have any hypotheses on why that might be? And I really want to
emphasize that I mean this... I slept terribly the whole season. Yeah? Because in fact, I am... jet lagged! (whooping) See you in season... 10? Oh, god! We've been doing this
for way too long. Oh, man! Good bye!
Good bye! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Okay. I did it! Adam did it. The season's over. But guess what? Your relationship
with us is not over. Because we just put out,
only on Nebula, the Jet Lag season 9
cut-for-time special. It's a full-length video,
it's 21 minutes, that is clips from this season that didn't make it
into episodes, but that we thought
were fun and silly and that you should get to see and that is available
right now on Nebula. We also did one for
last season that's a lot of fun. And that's not even
the only thing that we have exclusive
to Nebula right now. Tell them, Ben. If you want to stay entertained
by us during the off-season, you've got The Layover,
our after-show podcast. We're going to keep it running
through the off-season. We do little games,
weird little episodes. We usually don't know
what we're doing, but it's a good time. You can keep watching
The Layover during the off-season. What else, Adam? There's so many
creators on Nebula who not only put up
their YouTube videos often early and
ad-free and extended, but they also make
a lot of Originals. There are Originals from – and they're going
to scroll right now – (rapping)
RealLifeLore, Real Science, Real Engineering, Abigail Thorn, Patrick Willems,
Brody Deschanel, Lindsay Ellis. Also us,
we've made a bunch. And also... Mustard. And also other ones, but I can't
always remember all of them, but you're probably
seeing some of them now. Polyphonic, I think
that's another one. Yeah! They're all my favorite,
but Adam, surely this streaming service
costs $1 million a day because of all of the
content on it. Ben, what if I told you it actually doesn't cost
a million dollars a day? It costs $30 for the whole year! But it only costs $30
for the whole year if you use our code nebula.tv/jetlag
nebula.tv/jetlag nebula.tv/jetlag You have to use that link, and that gets you a discount and then it also tells them
that we sent you, and that's important for us. If you do the link,
then they know we sent you, and then we get a portion
of your subscription for as long as
you stay subscribed, which gives us money

welcome to episode four of hide-and-seek
across Switzerland. Right now, we're exactly
halfway through the game with two days remaining. I'm about to start my
first run as Hider, and the stakes couldn't be higher. If I can last until
the end of the day, I'll win the game
right then and there. There wouldn't be enough
time left in our four days for either Ben or Adam to
get back into first place. But that's not gonna be easy. Ben and Adam are planning on
playing aggressively this round, so I've gotta hope that
I've picked the right hiding spot. And we are... so back! So I think it's worth narrating what Ben and Adam
are doing right now. At least, I think, so, you know. They're starting at the playground.
We know that. (softly)
Hello, good morning. We're talking quietly because we're in an extremely
residential area. And we're just on a playground, which feels creepy anyway.
Yeah. And Adam is probably
starting by saying something like, ""Ben, the first train
out of here is in five minutes, and we're an
eight-minute walk away, so we gotta run."" And as soon as
the clock strikes 7:30, we gotta run to the train station because there is a train
in five minutes to Lucerne. That's true.
We know that from yesterday. So they can make it, but it's going to be
tight and stressful. (quietly)
Alright, go, go, go! Okay. And... I think there's maybe
a 50-50 shot Ben is clutching his hat
like this. Who knows? (metal crashing) (laughs) No! Yeah. (metal clattering)
Oh dear. I didn't even see that. Okay, that's fine. (wheezes) Keep going, keep going. I think they're gonna make it? I think they're gonna make it. But, you know, we'll see. What? Where our turn is,
do you remember? No, I think it's up here. (breathes exhaustedly) I totally got the wind
knocked out of me. And I ran into that sign. It's okay. Oh, it's so dark. Alright, Ben,
let's ask the rhyme question. I still think
that asking that first is the best strat. Okay, we're buying the rhymes. Alright, they've
asked for rhymes. Which is not a surprising start, 'cause I think we agree that
that's a very good start. However, because of that, I prepared for these
yesterday on my way here, and I already have the words. One of the reasons
I liked it here was because it had a very
common ending to its name. That applies to a lot
of other places too. Anyway, we'll send it over shortly. Luxembourg,
Endomorph, Hawk, Pen, Monsieur. Doesn't rhyme with Basel. Et cetera, et cetera. Let's hit him with longitude. Yeah, I mean, this is
still going to determine what direction we go next. Right now,
Ben and Adam have determined that they just need to keep me
under 250 total coins, because that's when the likelihood of rolling top-tier curses
becomes too high. But until then,
they've decided to ask whatever questions they want. Let's hit him with longitude. Alright, question
number two: longitude. Another thing
that I thought about, I've gone to an area that has... quite a lot of train lines. There are quite a lot
of options around here. So longitude,
it'll narrow it down a bit, but not massively. Alright Ben,
Sam is east of us. Okay, well then we should
probably head towards Zürich. We should probably head
towards the general Zürich area. But unfortunately, east is a little more complicated than
if he had been west of us. I was really hoping
he was going to be west. I had more of a plan for west. I mean, one thing
we could do, Ben... We could do geographic region. Find out if he's
up here or down here. Because I think we agree
it's more likely he's north. Well... I think in that case, what might be more
useful is to do... canton region. No, because
we're in this region, and I don't think he's here. And I'm saying if we just
go up into the Zürich area. But then we have to go
to Zürich. I know, but... I think that there's a
very, very, very good chance that he's in there.
And if he's not, that tells us a lot of information. Okay. We're in Lucerne. Let's get off, figure out
our next move. Okay, welcome back
to Lucerne. I think the next thing
that we really want to know is just basically, is he
north of us or south of us? Is he in the sort of
dense Zürich-y area? Or is he way down in the
far reaches of whatever? I think he's in the
dense Zürich-y area. I think he's almost
definitely around there. But even then, it's a
matter of figuring out... Yeah.
Is he near Winterthur, or is he in one of the suburbs? Yeah. Alright. I actually really need
to go to the bathroom. Okay, you do that. Alright, well, it seems like they're holding off on
additional questions for now. So, let's talk strategy. So, I have one very major
disadvantage in this game, which is that, at this point, it seems almost impossible
that I'll get a second run. The one advantage
that I have, though, is I have two rounds
that I have learned from. And I feel like
I've learned a lot about how to position
myself in the right place to make it as difficult
as possible for them. One thing that I noticed
is both of them, they went basically to the
maximum theoretical distance that they could go,
based on their transition time. I didn't. I could've gone
further than this. Not by too much, but I'm
not at the theoretical limit of how far I could go. The long game, I don't think is
going to be too difficult for them. The medium game, though... That's going to be tricky. 'Cause there's just
so many rail lines around this area of the country. So many places. It's one of the densest areas. Even once they narrow
it down to here, I've come to a city. I saw how difficult
it was to narrow down in just that small place
with only so many streets yesterday with Ben. I've come to a place that has
way more streets, way more density, way more options for
where I can be. So, it's gonna be tricky.
We'll see. Adam, welcome back
from the bathroom. How was it? You know, a life hack. Always go to
the bathroom on a train because they made me pay. Okay Ben,
what do we want to do? I mean, maybe we
should just ask a question to confirm that he's not south. I think we definitely need
to confirm he's not south. Okay, in that case, if we really want to
confirm that he's not south, then I do think that the... geographic region question will cleanly eliminate
basically all of that. Yeah, but we have to
wait another nine minutes before we can ask that question. Well, they've
made it to Lucerne. So it'll be interesting
to see where they go next. I mean, the correct place for them to go next
would be Zürich. And that would be
fairly intuitive. And I wouldn't be
too concerned because there are just
so many options out of Zürich. I'd only get concerned,
kind of, if they get on the right
line out of Zürich. Do you want to... hop on a train toward Zürich? (huffs)
I mean, it's a little risky. But I think that the chance that he is that direction
is very high. Okay, when's the
next train to Zürich? It's in three minutes. Oh goodness, okay. So, why don't we go for it? Okay, right here, right here. Okay, so... Our train to Zürich is leaving. But we need to ask
a question now to confirm whether or not
he's north of us. So, we're buying
the information of whether or not he's in the
same geographic region as us. So, like, if he says
he's in the Alps, that does mean that
he's south of us, but... If he's in the Plateau, then it does mean that
we're going the right way. Alright, new question. No, it went away.
But they asked whether we're in
the same geographic region. I'm not actually sure.
Let's check. Alright. He should be
answering us any second. Yes, he's in the Plateau. Okay, that's good to know.
Okay. And that significantly
limits his region. (marker scribbling) Yeah. Yeah, I mean... We've given him, you know, a decent number of coins,
but not too many. Look, he might even
be celebrating right now. He might be like,
""Great, I have all these coins."" But we're coming for
your ass, Sam. I'm already at 90 coins, 'cause that's two
comparative questions plus an oddball.
That's 90 coins. I'm almost to a
two-dice roll curse. I'm guessing,
based on yesterday, they're gonna take an approach of asking a ton of questions
to try to narrow me down, which means that I can just
pepper them with curses, and potentially roll
a pretty devastating one. We'll see. Alright, well, it seems like
they're on a train out of Lucerne, I think to Zürich
based on the timing. Not 100% sure. But, I'm gonna use
this opportunity to start surveying my zone. You know, looking for
hiding spots. What do I get here? You know, all that. And, my first destination, which I think might be
a great hiding spot, is right in front of me. The forest. So again, we're sort of
playing Guess Who here. You ever play Guess Who? Where you're trying to be like,
""Are you bald?"" It's that game.
Yeah. Mark Rober made a
great video about Guess Who. And what he said is, the
best way to play Guess Who is with each question,
try to eliminate 50% of all possibilities. Yeah, and so,
with every question, we're just trying to cut off
half the map, and... I do think that the best way of cutting off the
next half of the map is to ask a 25-mile radius
right about now. I think that that is right. Because that
would basically tell us, are you here,
or are you out here? Right. Either way, I would
quite like to know the answer. It cuts about halfway through
the northern Zürich suburbs. Right, but again, I think
we're being right to just... don't fear buying information. No. Buy the information
immediately. We will worry about curses later. As long as we keep it
under 300 coins, I think we are
not really in danger. Yep. Ooh, they've asked
for a radar. And they've asked
for a 25-mile radar. I think I'm outside of that.
Let me check. Ooh, okay, it's gonna be
a miss, but just barely. Oh, that's gonna be
really misleading. Because it's like,
they clearly thought maybe I was in the
greater Zürich area, and I kind of am. Anyway, I think this is
gonna trip them up. That's lucky. Okay, so... This is interesting.
The radius was a miss. I actually think that's
really good news. I think that is
really helpful information. That means he is not... in Zürich. And he's not in sort of the
northern Zürich suburbs. Okay, I need to try... I think I think that means
we want to go to Winterthur. Probably. Yeah, this is
looking promising. So, from here you can see the other key advantage
of my zone. Not only are there woods here,
but over there too. So there are two zones of woods that they're gonna have to search. Okay, I'm gonna poke
into these woods a bit to see...
what it would look like to hide in them. I kinda like this spot. I'm gonna take a
mental note of it, but... Let's go poke around
our zone some more. Okay, welcome to Zürich. For the first time
in the game. Well, maybe.
Sam might've been here. That's true. Was he here? Let us know. He almost certainly
went through Zürich, wherever he went. Yeah.
He's up here. We've boxed him in
pretty good, but now there's... dozens and dozens
and dozens of towns. Lots of places he could be. I mean, I really hope
he's not here. Probably not.
Probably not. That would be annoying. There are a few options. We could ask the canton question and eliminate all of this. Yep.
Or confirm it. I think that would
not be a bad idea. No, I mean that gets us
pretty close to half the— Or we could go to Winterthur and do a 10-mile radar. Yeah.
Which is slightly cheaper. There's a good chance, I mean, I feel like one of our
top theories at this point is that he's in
one of the weird towns outside of Winterthur. One other thing we could do is we could split the remaining
territory down the middle by asking if he's
near the same International airport.
'Cause there's one in Zürich, and there's one in
St. Gallen, here. And we could find out
if he's here or here, but... (squacks) I don't know! I mean... Maybe we just need to
stick to our guns of eliminating 50%. I agree. And eliminating 50%
would mean the airport question would
eliminate closest to 50%. But the thing is,
it's 50% of the area. I don't know that it's
50% of the options. Ugh, let's look at
the maps again. Look, we're at the
point where we have to be very careful
about the questions that we ask. Well, looks like
they made it to Zürich. Which is... I don't think I should be
too concerned about that, 'cause it was kind of
the most obvious train to the east from Lucerne. So it'll be interesting to see
which train out of there they take. I don't think they have
nearly enough info to figure out where I am yet, unless they had
a really good guess. I feel pretty good
about asking the canton. But, I don't know, it's like,
there's all this (bleep) But I guess he couldn't
be in any of this. I don't think he could
quite be in any of this. But—
I think he could be here. Yeah, I like canton. That's expensive, but I think
it's the most useful question. I think that that's
probably the closest to eliminating
50% of possibilities. (sighs) Okay, let's do it. Alright, new question. Same canton? I'm not sure, let's check. We should be prepared
to go to Winterthur. Yeah, I honestly think
we should go to Winterthur, kind of, no matter what.
Okay. Sam?
Ugh. Are you in the
same canton as us? Sam?
What do you hope he says? I hope he says yes, probably. Okay, well that's unfortunate. They got me. It's a big canton though,
with a lot of stuff, so... That still could take 'em a bit, but that really narrows
it down for them. Anyway. That's how the jets lag. You wanna go? Yeah, yeah.
Alright, let's go. Let's do it. Alright, off to Winterthur. Alright. Okay. Ben, he is in
the same canton as us which continues to be
useful information. I mean, that cuts off
a big old chunk. Well, you're probably seeing
a motion graphic version of this, but he's somewhere in here. I think that is quite
useful information. We're zeroing in on him. I think once we get
to Winterthur, maybe a 5-mile radar
or something. I mean, certainly if he's not
within five miles of Winterthur, then, I don't know where... I don't know where he could be. I think that
the real question is... what is this rough size of
the place that he is in? Right. A photo of the train station
might be helpful for that. I like photo of the
train station regardless. 'Cause it's a great way to check. 'Cause you can check... It's always useful to check. Okay. Let's ask for a photo
of the train station. I think that, you know, we're gonna need that photo
at a certain point. Yeah, might as well
get it now. Might as well get it now
while we're on our way. Yeah. We're still in safe territory. Mostly safe territory. To be clear. Mostly safe. Okay, well,
I basically just made it to wood zone number two, and was gonna start
surveying, but... they asked for a photo
of the train station. And I think I have some
ideas about how to make it ...not that indicative. Okay, so here's my thinking. Outside of this station
is all kind of the same style of brick
and windows and everything, so I think any exterior shot is
going to be pretty indicative. But... We are allowed interior shots. And you can see in here. And I looked on Google. There's not a single
photo of this interior. (camera click) Much like Ben's yesterday, I don't think that a shot
of that would be useful until they're here,
which is what I want. So I think I'm gonna try that. See how that works. Hello, and welcome
to Winterthur. (coughs) Okay, well Sam
just sent us a picture, and I think it's pretty useful. This is a picture of
the train station. Well, it's telling...
Which tells me... It's probably not a
super rural station. (sighs) Maybe he's here? I mean, there are ways we
could find out if he's here. (sighs) Well... Okay, small problem. Actually, you know what?
I'll change that. I might characterize
that as major problem. Eeehhh... They're downtown. How did they guess this place? Aw, man. That is bad. I think I'm gonna start
walking towards the forest. Just in case, you know? I think what we should do is, I think about half of the
remaining train stations are within five miles of here. I think about half
are outside of it. I agree. It's certainly densest
closest to right here. So I kind of think...
we hit him with the radar. Either way,
we then make a list of every remaining train station
that also rhymes. I think then,
we find some clever way to use an oddball or photo
to eliminate half of those. I think that's...
That's kind of my opinion. I think that that's doable.
But I agree. I think that probably the
most sensible thing to do is just to drop
a small radius here Yeah.
and just see... Is he close to Winterthur, or is he in the sort of outskirts? But I will remind you.
I mean, 30... A radar puts him at 205. I don't want to let him
get to 250 if we can avoid it.
I agree. I think under no circumstances
can we let him get to 300. Because if he's at 300,
he has a 50% chance of being allowed to move
his hiding spot. Which would be a true disaster. Let's go ahead
and put down that... You want to.
Put down that radar. Okay, let's do it. They did a 5-mile radar. I don't think
I'm escaping this one. How did they guess here
first out of everywhere? That—
There has to have been some luck involved
in that, right? Oh, man. Alright. I'm gonna let them know. Alright, answer should be
coming any minute. Mmm, I'm hungry. You wanna get some food? Yeah. I mean, here. Is this a coffee shop? Yeah, okay.
Looks like it. Ooh. It's a hit, Ben. Folks, it's a hit.
It's a hit. So that means we are within
five miles of Sam right now. Look, we're two hours in. We're within five miles
of the man. I feel pretty good about that. Here's what I'll say.
We're two hours in right now. I'm doubtful that he'll
make it ten hours. Unless it takes us
eight hours to figure out— Just don't say anything.
Yeah, you're right. Just don't say anything.
Let's sit down and make a list of
where he could be. Okay. To be honest, I don't think
this is going to be a winning run. But, I actually have the money – or the coins rather –
for four dice. He's going to be very
excited about all these coins. With four dice,
pretty good chance that he could roll
something pretty good. The curses start
getting bad around 17, they start to really get messy. I think he has
a pretty solid chance of hitting at least a 17 with 4. Yeah. So, I think I might as well
see what curse I get. See if that can at least
get me a little something. Here we go. This is kind of
the last Hail Mary. Oh, that doesn't look good. Swiss cheese curse. Before you ask your next question, you must acquire
8 ounces of Swiss cheese and fill in all of its holes
on the outside – you may break it open
to make holes – with other types of cheese. You may not advance in the game until you have a
solid block of cheese from outward appearance. (sputters) I feel like... again... They have to have gotten at
least a little bit lucky, right? Okay.
Well... We were about to
sit down for some coffee, but he's hit us with a curse. Which to me, incredible news because it means he has
spent at least two dice. We actually don't have
to do this curse right now because this is just before
we ask our next question. Yeah, but let's just
knock it out. There's a cheese shop
right there. (laughs uproariously) Sorry, Sam. Aw, dude, that
totally sucks for you, man! Thank you.
Thank you. You ready to look like lunatics? Yeah, that's what we do best! You gotta imagine he was
not pleased with that. No, that's... (laughs) That's a brutal roll.
It's also like... I don't know
if he rolled two dice. I don't know if he rolled three.
I don't know if he rolled four. I kinda bet he rolled four. There is a chance
that he rolled four. And if he rolled four,
I'm so sorry, Sam. This sucks. Ah, damn it. Another thing I would say
for Sam, unfortunately, and maybe he's in Winterthur, maybe that's why he
did this, but... Don't hit us with a curse when we're in the
middle of a dense city. That actually makes me think that he might be in Winterthur. Maybe he thinks that we're
in the endgame now. If he's hitting us with a curse now. It's possible. Do you want to do it, or shall I? Okay, here we go. We're opening our cheese. It turns out in Switzerland,
they do not call it Swiss cheese. Yeah, we were in the store,
and we were like, ""There's not one
labeled Swiss cheese. What do we do?"" No, only America
has the audacity to name a cheese after itself. And now there's a problem. As you can see,
it's full of holes. Right. Seemingly
a manufacturing error, I would assume. But we are
gonna go ahead and fix that for you,
Switzerland. Wow, you really
can smell that cheese. Yeah. Alright, your hands
are gonna get a little messy. Yeah, I think that's just, you know,
an occupational hazard. And we're just gonna
go ahead and... fill up our holes here. I hope it
makes him feel better that it's kind of
unpleasant for you. Yeah, well... No, it's pleasant. Alright, I believe... We've done it. That's a solid block of cheese. Switzerland, you are welcome. We have gone ahead
and fixed your cheese. We went ahead
and fixed your cheese. Now it's good for eating. Yeah. Curse complete. That took, what,
ten minutes? Yeah. Alright, I think now
let's go to the coffee shop and figure out what to do next. Alright, well... I would say so far,
things have gone quite well. I mean, the fact that
he used those cursed dice is... I would argue, great for us
and a massive mistake for him. But honestly... Unless he's here. The only reason I can think
that he would do that— It doesn't make sense. Unless he's here. He either did something stupid,
or he's here. But we can go check the
train station for that photo. Well, that's
one thing we can do. Another thing we can do is we can ask him for
a picture of a McDonald's because almost
anywhere in Winterthur will be within a mile
of a McDonald's. And none of those other towns
have McDonald's, right? I'm pretty sure
that that is the case. Let's ask for a photo
of a McDonald's. Okay. Photo of McDonald's. And honestly, that, if he is here, that can
help us figure out what part of town he's in. Yeah. Alright. They're asking for
a photo from McDonald's. There's one in the zone. Let's go get it. Alright, I have arrived
at the McDonald's. Let's find a nice
five-foot tranche. It's hard to identify windows. Maybe the windows and
that little poster. Yeah, let's do that. (camera click) Alright, I'm gonna go
walk to the woods. To at least be
near my hiding spot for once they trend here. Okay, he sent us—
He's by a McDonald's. He sent us a photo
of a McDonald's, which means that
he is in Winterthur. Oh, Sam. Oh, buddy. But that explains why
he used the curse on us. Yeah, it does. Okay, well, I figure
we can figure out which McDonald's this is. We're right
next to one of them. There's four. We're not allowed
to use Street View. We're allowed to look
at pictures, but I think he has
very intentionally— Ooh—! Is that it? I mean, those are
the same benches. Which one is that?
Same benches. Same ground. I think it's this one. The man's in trouble. I mean, here's what I will say. We have not yet played
an endgame in a dense urban area. It could be quite difficult. And it's still very possible
he could get second. We are not outta the woods. Alright, back at the forest. This is where I was almost before they sent me
to the station. This is kind of the more
convoluted forest to get to. So I'm hoping that, you know, once they probably ask
a precision question that shows that I'm
in the forest, they'll go start searching
the other one first. We'll see. But... Hopefully I can find a
nice, dense spot in here. Alright. Really gaining
some altitude here. This path that I'm on isn't even marked on
Google Maps. So... Hopefully it's a bit
tricky to find? And then I think
I'll find a good spot... you know, actually in the woods. Alright, Ben. Let's kick it. So we're what, we're
just over three hours in? I think that we can
get him before four and a half,
which was my time. I think so too. I would, because again, I really would like to remain
at least in second place. Unless he's picked
a really amazing hiding spot. In fact, you know what? I bet that's exactly
what he's going for. Alright, six minutes
from McDonald's. I mean, we should
be entering the endgame any moment, really. Well, they're
going the wrong way. (record scratch) Which is promising. It looks like they're walking
to another McDonald's that kind of has a similar profile in that it's near a secondary
station in the city. Not the main station. But they're not walking
to the right one. They're walking, in fact,
exactly away from me. So they're now almost
two miles away. They're on completely the
other side of the city. It's looking promising. I'm not seeing benches right now, but I think they're
probably in the back. I sure hope
this McDonald's matches. Because if it doesn't, that's
going to be really annoying. At about this moment, Ben and Adam are
going to realize... that they're at the
wrong McDonald's. Sorry, guys. There was that sign. A guy running. I don't see a guy running. No running guy? Not promising.
No. He might have tricked us. Let's double check. There's a reflection
in the window of a barricade. Alright. Yeah, I see that. And it's a
different kind of fence. Ooh. I think I got it. I think it's this one. Okay, we'll head out there. Okay. Yeah, he got our asses. Well, now things get
a little more interesting in terms of if we can find him... in time for second place. Okay, yeah. We can take a train over there. Okay, great. It's a little annoying. Okay, let's get on this train
and get to his McDonald's. So, in order to make it
to second place... It's 10:55 now. I need to make it
until 12:14. Which is not that much longer. I mean, that feels...
possible, right? Okay, so it was just a
little bit of research, and it looks like
they definitely had some bad luck with
a 50-50 shot because there are only
four McDonald's within the 5-mile radius. That one's in the city center, so it clearly would not
match that photo. That one's in a mall,
also clearly would not match. So they're basically these two
that would match. I photoed this one.
They went to this one. That's pretty bad luck. That does, however, mean that they're almost
certainly headed here now. This is us. Just one stop. Alright, Sam, this better be
the (bleep) right McDonald's. Alright, Ben. Well, now, it's a 16 minute walk
to the other McDonald's. Excellent. Coming for you, Sam, finally. Alright, they're nearly at
the close McDonald's. Which... tells me that they're
about to find out that they're basically
in the endgame. So it's time to find
a nice, cozy spot in the woods. I'm gonna leave the path here
and push into the woods. I think the further, the better. Need it to be thicc! T-H-I-C-C. I think that's it. It's the same kind— See? That's it. That's it, alright. Wait, wait, I've always
wanted to do this. I've always wanted to
do the thing that... ""Sam's been here.""
You know? Like detectives do.
Oh sure, okay, yeah. Okay, great. Let's find him. Alright. Found a nice little spot here. And I think, if I lie down... it shouldn't be visible from the paths around here. I think. I think let's start with street. Yeah, we'll get a street,
because that'll give us... And we can start looking. Maybe a direction to go. Alright. They've asked for
the letter of the first street. Which is 'A'. Hopefully there are
a lot of 'A' streets around. And at least I don't think
that'll be very useful, but it might narrow them down to this set of woods
versus the other. But then there's also
this giant park in his area. Yeah. And it would be
very much like Sam to go hide in a park. Yeah, to hike. 'Cause I think it's
a mountain. I don't even know
that it's a park. I think it just sort of is
a mountain. Nearest street, 'A', okay. Do any of the streets in
the park start with 'A'? No. Not that I... can tell. Not that I see. Hold on, just really quick. Here's something that
no one has realized yet. The 'A' street that I'm near
– Auenrainstrasse – is really small.
So small, in fact, that its name won't show up
on Google Maps unless you zoom
all the way in to check it. And that's about to spell
trouble for Ben and Adam. What are streets around here
that start with 'A'? There's Anton-Graff-Strasse. There's Agnesstrasse
and Ankerstrasse. Did you get Albrechtstrasse? I just want to make sure
that he's not in the park. I think that he can't be. I mean, I still think the
photo might be the best. Okay, photo.
Photo up or back? Probably... ba... What do you think? I think let's hit him
with an up actually. Okay. 'Cause he's
probably near buildings. Alright, they're asking
for a photo up. This is gonna be... This is gonna give away a lot. (camera click) I would just say again, we don't have the most
time ever to find him. No. In order for me to stay
in second place, we need to find him
in the next 45-ish minutes. Okay, we got the photo. Oh, those are trees. It's all trees. It's all trees. Big time tree situation. Huh, okay. That's helpful.
That's interesting. But I really don't
think that, I mean... Maybe we need
to look real closely. What about this? Amselweg. Amselweg? Ooh. Yeah, I like that. I like that. I mean, right now,
I don't see any other place that qualifies. But I don't wanna go
all the way over there. It's gonna be a long walk
if we're wrong. Can we do
walk to the train station? How long would it take you
to walk to the train station? I think let's ask him that,
and let's start heading that way. Okay? Okay. Yeah. I don't, I mean...
We gotta find him in time. I think that... I don't see any other
places that he could be. Next question: How long
to walk to the train station? Let's see what it says. Hm. Yeah, because
Google doesn't have all of the paths marked out
kind of in this area. So it thinks it takes longer
than it does, basically. Did you check how far of a walk it is from the train station,
if we are right? So I think anything,
yeah, anything in that, within a couple minutes
of that, we keep going. 31 minutes. Okay, so it can't be that. Well... Probably not, but... Yeah. Hold on.
Probably not. Hold on. Let's re-evaluate. Now I'm getting really nervous
about finding him in time. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Here's the thing. There are not a lot of places
that are going to be that far of a walk
from the train station. Come on! They're still
in this random park. It really feels like they're
wasting a lot of time there. We have to find him
in the next 14 minutes, Ben. I think we just need to
guess in a direction. I think we need to
start walking north. And just hope that
that works or something. It's 14 minutes or nothing. Alright, we need to figure out... Just another question. But he's for sure
in the woods. I think we should
ask for street orientation. Okay, good news. Actually, let's do bad news first. Bad news is it's raining. The good news is that it's getting very close
to my second place time. And they're not even going
in the right direction. This is great. I'm imagining they're... It's kind of hard to spot the road that I'm
closest to on the map because it's so close
to another road. I'm imagining that might
be tripping them up. We'll see.
But they just asked for the intercardinal direction
to that road, so I'll give that to them next. Oh, Ben. What? Where? Where could he be?! Wait, wait, wait? What is this? Is this a park? It might be.
I think it's somebody's yard. But it says park. Let's go there. Well, the trees don't
look right, but whatever. Let's just start walking there. At a minimum. Woah. I mean, I still just don't know. I don't know either, man. It's nearly time. Wait, let me pull out my watch. (rain dripping) Well, Ben, it's 12:14, which means Sam has
slid into second place. It's 12:14. Do you know
what that means? That's second place! Let's go! Well... I mean, I still
need to deny Adam a better time
with his next run. But, they're still not here. And that's me officially
in second place. Better than I thought
was possible a couple hours ago. So, let's see
how long this takes. Oh, if we hadn't gone
to the wrong McDonald's! I think we could've done it. Look, I think we're
gonna catch him today, which means you'll get
another shot. Which means... you can still supplant him. Well, I can still
supplant you, even. That is true. Less likely. The thing is,
we are on an 'A' street, and that's the woods-woods. But—
You just go down this path. But this path had the street
I believe. Does that path not have a name? Well, it looks like
they're searching a completely different
set of woods that is actually
outside of my zone. They don't know that. That is next to another
road that starts with 'A'. And all that. This just keeps getting
better and better. It's really just like... Where the (bleep)
do we go? So, Ben and Adam kept looking, and still unable to find
the right streets, they bought a half-mile radar to see if they were even
in the right part of town. Alright, little update. First of all, I realized I could shove my umbrella
down my back. And then I wouldn't have
to hold it all this time. Second of all, they just
asked for a half-mile radar, which they are not
even close to within. Ben, our radar was a miss. Okay. Now knowing they
were nowhere close, they turned their sights
on the other side of town. And after a long research session, they finally found something. Wait. What? What about
Auen...rainstrasse? He could be on—
Yeah. Yeah. Ben, look. This path doesn't have a name. But if he was on it, he would
be nearest to Auenrainstrasse. Okay, that's it. And then he would be far from the (bleep)-ing
train station. That's where he is.
Let's go get him. (whispering)
(bleep) you, Sam. So, confident
about my location, they set off on an
hour-long trek to the base of the mountain. (sighs) I cannot believe
it's gonna take an hour to walk over there. Uuuggh! For me personally, Ben,
this sucks. The thing is, he can't actually
be that deep into the woods. It's actually... The sun has come out,
which is nice. Kind of cold still, but, you know. I didn't expect to be stuck
in the endgame for so long. So I didn't really
bring many snacks. Basically the only thing
I have are Sports Beans. I don't know if you've
ever heard of Sports Beans, but they're made by
jelly beans or, you know, Jelly Belly. So, I guess this is an
impromptu episode of... (mumbling) Choo Choo Chew: Derailed. Definitely not Snack Zone. Delicious. I kinda hope they get here soon. I want some lunch. I also wanna win though. Okay, we are
approaching the woods. The big question... Which direction do we go? I actually think
we need to go left. Well, I guess
one question is how deep is he into the woods? We could ask him how many
feet from the road he is. That might be useful.
You want to? Yeah. Okay, here, you go for it. Well, they've asked me how many feet I am
to the nearest road, which might help them. I don't know, we'll see. Alright, I have enough money
for a two-dice roll curse. I think I'm gonna wait. 'Cause they kinda get
exponentially worse. And I think they're
going to have to ask a good number more
precision questions to have any good shot
of finding me. He's 860 feet
from the nearest road. (bleep) Well... That would mean he's pretty far. (weakly)
Oh Sam, you bastard. Oh my god. We're close. We're a
four-minute walk away. I'm gonna stump it up. Okay. We're almost there. Well, I think we're almost there. Won't it be annoying if we're not? The only thing
that makes me feel good about Sam being at
the top of this is I know that he thinks
that shiz— this (bleep) is funny. Ugh. Alright, we're starting
to get quite close. So I'm laying down
so that hopefully... it'll reduce my
visibility from the path that you know, they're
probably gonna be on. We just have to
get around this bend. He should be on the other side. He better be around this corner. Okay, they're
getting pretty close. No, it should be
right around here. I don't see him. He shouldn't be able
to see me from there. But once they get
a little bit closer, I'll probably be within eyesight. He might be the other way. I think we just need to
walk up here a little ways. Before we count it out. They're at the right
distance from the road now. So they just need to
come kind of this way. I wonder if they'll go
through the forest. They might come over
that ridge over there. So, I'm sure that we've
cut this down a lot, but I just want to emphasize that we've been in the
woods for so long now. We've been in the woods for a truly outrageous
amount of time. How long have we been
in the woods, Ben? I don't want to know. At least 45 minutes. Wait, is that
his (bleep) umbrella? We got him. No, that's just a guy.
No, that's a guy. No, that's a guy with his dog. No, Ben, it's just
a guy with his dog. It's simply a man with his dog. Oh, I thought that was Sam. That sucks a lot. Oh, I wish that man was Sam. I was so confident. We really need to reevaluate. Okay. Despite being
only 400 feet from me, they still couldn't find me. So they asked question... We're asking him his distance
from his nearest intersection. After question... We're asking if he's
on the same street as us. After question... Do you wanna ask him
any more (bleep) stuff? And got lost again... Wait. Oh, sorry.
I think it's this path. Oh, okay. Well, it's actually,
it's hard to tell. And again... I mean... Nothing? Nothing here! And again... Look man, I don't know. I am doing my best. And again... This is hell, Ben.
We're living in hell. And again. I'm gonna ask these
people if they've seen Sam. Excuse me! Hi. Have you seen our friend? We're looking for our friend,
a blond man? Well, I've now been here for... three and— more than
three and a half hours. I do feel bad for them because I know
how much it sucked to be searching for Ben
for two hours yesterday. And it's been
a lot more than that, and they've covered
a lot more ground. I'm sure they're getting tired
and frustrated and all that. I'm gonna kill Sam. I'm going to kill him dead. Meanwhile, while
I considered continuing to hold out for 150 coins
so I could roll three dice, I ultimately decided to
go for a two-dice roll. Alright, here we go. Ugh, three, come on,
that's ridiculous. What is that? Swiss clock. Before you ask your next question, you must clap 15 seconds after your other team member
starts a timer, within 0.5 seconds,
on each side of 15 seconds. If you fail, you must wait at least 10 minutes
before reattempting. Okay, they're
coming closer again. This might be it. (whispering)
I think I hear them. I see his umbrella. I think that's his umbrella. Oh, I just heard him say
he sees an umbrella. (wheezes)
I think he's coming. There they are. Wait, there they are. There they are. Oh my god, Sam. How dare you do this to us. I had a great time
in the woods. Ugh, yeah. I'm sure. Oh my god, dude. I'm stuck in a bramble. (giggles)
Hi, Sam. I think it's very difficult
for you, from your side of it, to understand
just how hard it is to figure this out
from our side. Yes. I mean, it's supposed to be hard. I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at you.
I'm just... Anyway, you got
some running to do. The main station is a
51-minute walk from here. Yeah. So you should probably go. Alright guys.
Good luck, Adam. Not just not such good luck
that you got first place. See you never.
Alright, let's do this. You got this. Go somewhere
in Switzerland. Oh my god,
this sucks so much. He's zooming.
He really is zooming. Good luck, Adam. All it really comes down to is: if we catch Adam early tomorrow, I'm still in first,
and you're still in second. But if we can't make that happen, he could win the whole thing. Yeah, which... he would
really gloat about. He would. Look, it's the...
The wins go to his head. But the solo wins,
oh the solo wins. Alright, let's do it. There's a train in
nine minutes. The second I get here,
I have to run. It's a high-risk move. It's a high-risk move. I think I made it. I made it. God, I hope this works. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Ben and Adam
are about to leave. I'm at the airport. But I forgot
to mention to them that the finale is up
on Nebula right now. And they have a really long flight. It's like 15, 16 hours. Oh my gosh, Ben,
we're about to board our flight, but we don't have
anything to watch! This flight's
gonna be super long. I'm gonna get so bored,
I'm gonna go cuckoo. If only there was a solution that would give us
something to watch. And the finale's up
on Nebula right now. And they can download it,
you know, using the Nebula app offline. And then that way,
they'll have something to watch. I don't think
such a solution exists. I don't think there's any way that we could watch
anything on our flight. And certainly not any episode
of our show that we make. No. No.
Not a new one. So even if we could
watch an old episode, there's no way we could
watch a new episode. And even if we could do
either of those things, there's no way that it
would be the finale. No. There's no way to
watch it, I don't think. I don't think there's a way for
us to watch the finale right now. There they are, there they are. Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. I forgot to mention.
What is it? The finale is up on Nebula. Wait, the finale's up
on Nebula? That would mean that
we could watch it right now if we went to
nebula.tv/jetlag. Right now, right now. But surely such a good deal
couldn't be discounted. No, no, no, it's 40% off, but only if you use our link. Only if you use our link? You can watch it?
Do it at nebula.tv/jetlag. But we're about
to get on a plane! Certainly, I couldn't
download it. No, you could download it. You can download it and
watch videos offline on Nebula? Right now. This is the best deal
I've ever heard of in my whole life.
Wait, wait, wait. What would I watch
on Nebula? Jet Lag: the finale.
The finale? The finale.

welcome to episode three of our four day game of
hide-and-seek across Switzerland. Right now, Adam and I
are looking for Ben based on a few key
pieces of information: He's hiding somewhere in this blob, in a canton that did not vote
for the Centre Party, that is near a lake, that rhymes
with one of these five words, and has a train station
that looks like this. After wasting quite
a bit of time last episode looking for Ben in the Zug area, thanks to him sending
tricky rhyming words, Adam and I believe we might
have finally tracked him down in the town of Steinen. So, now we're arriving there, hoping to see a train station
that matches this photo. Well, already it seems
slightly more promising. Although very modern. Yeah, now it's
seeming less promising. No.
No. No.
Alright. Hmm. Oh, man. Where could he be? Okay, I actually think
that I might have found the perfect hiding spot. So... If you go through this
cute little tunnel... you get spat out in this... very secluded public pavilion. It's got a playground
down here that you can't see from
anywhere else in town. It's completely surrounded. I mean, I've been
walking around this town for legit hours... and I have not even caught a
glimpse of this playground. It's like a secret playground. I think this might be the move. It's not looking great. No. Oh, this, yeah, this... This station is so modern. He's not here. There's no way. I mean, last round
felt pretty simple, and now I'm realizing just how
complicated this game can be. I keep thinking that
they know exactly where I am, and that they're
about to come get me. But I am starting to think that they might not know
where I am at all. You're fumbling
the bag, boys. You're fumbling the bag. This was supposed to be
a bad run on my part. This was supposed to be
a damn disaster. Look at that little
timer graphic. Look at it tick up. That's pretty cool. Hey, that's pretty cool. Is that the high score? Yeah, I think that's
the high score. Yeah, I'm thinking that's
the high score right now. Ouch. I think we need a question. I think there might be
some logic to a radar. I mean, if we did 25, that would encompass
this entire region. I just still think he's here. Well, we should confirm. At this point.
I guess. And I agree, it's like, I don't want to spend
that much, but... it's much better to
spend that much now... than spend the next couple hours looking in the wrong
area of the country. Yeah, I guess. Alright. Okay, they've just... deployed a 25-mile radar. Which is interesting.
It is a hit. They're within 25 miles of me. That makes me think that
they're not very confident about where I might be. 'Cause obviously if they have
figured out that I am here... then they would just come here. We'll see. Alright, well,
he's within 25 miles. Oh, interesting. Great. Well... I mean, I kinda feel like
we already knew that, but... I guess good to know
for sure. Okay. Where the hell is he? ""Rug, Awaken, Boxcar,
Again, Clam."" After some more looking, we realized the next
town over, Seewen, fit all the parameters. It was within the still-viable zone, rhymed with 'Awaken',
had no town hall, and was definitely
close enough to the lake. So we decided to go check it out. I mean... It's very pretty. Oh yeah. It's the type
of place Ben would go. There's gravel on the sides of this. Mm, I don't know. Well, it makes sense
to get off regardless. Well, let's check it out. Yeah, maybe doesn't look like it. Doesn't seem like it. Could it be... Does not seem like it. Okay, well, I'm definitely
not seeing anything that looks like that photo. No, it's definitely not here. (growls) It's probably creepy
for me to be on the swing. I shouldn't be on the swing. That's not good. Now that it was clear
Ben couldn't be anywhere on this lake, we went back to the
drawing board searching for other candidates. I'm just trying
to figure out... Let me pull up
some of my maps. Vitznau[vist-now] wouldn't rhyme. 'Again' and 'awaken'
basically rhyme. So it's weird he put 'em both in. Mhm. He's not at Walchwil.
He's not at Hörndli. Chämleten? Is that on the west side? Yeah. What about Flüelen? Despite scouring the map, we couldn't find anywhere
that fit all the parameters. So, faced with no other options, we decided we had no choice but to head back up to
the stations around Zug to see if there was
something we'd missed. So you think he's... Think he was just
in Zug all along? I mean, it seems unlikely. But, I just don't see
other good candidates. Are they... Are they going back to Zug? Oh. Boys. Okay, alright, (bleep) it. I'm gonna go get lunch.
This is gonna take a while. (whispers) Oh, Jesus. On our way up to Zug,
we decided to ask Ben for a picture of the tallest
mountain he could see. Our logic was that he'd have
to shoot across the lake, meaning by looking at
his angle of the mountain, we could determine
his position on the lake. Of course, that assumed
he was on our same lake. Okay, well,
they've just asked me for a picture of
the tallest mountain that I can see from where I am. And that's an interesting one. I don't really know
why they asked that. So, these are basically all the mountains
you can see from here. And, though that mountain
is definitely the tallest... what we're supposed to do,
the point of this question is, what mountain is highest up
on your skyline, basically. So I have to send
a picture of this one. And hopefully that doesn't
give away too much. (camera clicks) Okay, let's go ahead and
send that picture to them and see what they make of it. Is this our third time here? Yeah, I think so. That's tough. Alright, well, the photo
of the mountain is useless. Because it's from his perspective, and seemingly there's
a mountain behind him. Alright, well, let's research to see if we can find
any other candidates. Yeah. Because we might
just be missing one. Yeah, it's certainly possible. Okay, it's lunch time. I don't know what
this is, but... it looked good. (full mouth)
Oh my god. Oh my god. That's so good. What is that? Tell me in the comments. Please tell me what this is. Because it's so good. Oh my god. This is so exciting for me. I love this. Clock is tickin'. I'm starting to think
he's not on this lake. (full mouth) Well, there's
only two other options. After some more looking, we did find
something we'd missed. You might've noticed this earlier, because you have
this neat little map. But we hadn't realized that while almost all of Lake Lucerne
is in the Lucerne Canton, which we'd ruled out
because of its political party, a very small part of it poked into
the still eligible Schwyz Canton, meaning it was possible
that was the lake Ben was on. Okay.
The road pattern of... Merlischachen kind of fits. But... it's not close enough
to feel like a slam dunk. Okay, but one second. Küssnacht am Rigi doesn't rhyme. ""Merli-shanen"" does. Okay, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait... wait...! I assume you're looking at
this thing here. Wait. No, I think this does match. Look... this thing. That totally matches that. Look at the bottom part. Look at these
next to each other. What is this place called? Melis, whatever. ""Merlis-chanen."" I mean, we would need some— To go all the way out there,
we would need something ...much more conclusive. No, this is the—
I think this is it. I really think this is it. Wait, wait, I'm gonna trace it. Mm-kay. That's gotta be it. Mmmmnnh... Come on! I mean you can clearly... mm. It's pretty close. That's it!
Okay, well, let's figure out whether or not there is
something in that town that can confirm it for us
before we go there. And look,
how about you do that? This just confirmed it for me. I guess I hadn't thought
about orientation yet. Orientation fits really well.
Look at that. It's exact. Yeah, actually, yeah. It's a perfect match. Now that I think
about orientation, yeah, that is pretty clear. Okay, seems like we have
about ten minutes until the next train option there. What platform, Sam? I think 2? He's... I'm confident that he's there. The road pattern
matches way too close. No, I mean, I agree. The road pattern
feels like a slam dunk. The road pattern
is a slam dunk. The road pattern's a slam dunk.
Doesn't have a town hall. And, wait, do we know
what it rhymes with? Yeah, it rhymes with 'awaken'. Yeah, no, feels good. Merlish— Mer— Merlischachen[mer-le-shaken]. Awaken. Yep. Alright, well, it looks like Sam and Adam have left
Zug once again, and they are heading back south. So, maybe, finally, they
have figured out where I am. Or at the very least,
they have figured out the area that I'm in. Does seem like they're... not wasting any more
time up in Zug. Now, I just have to see
if they do end up taking that rail line
towards Lucerne. Because if they do, they'll be heading towards me. (slurps loudly) So, this is the lake ...that we believe
he sent a picture of. And, I mean, I gotta tell you, that water looks like
the picture he sent. It's the same color.
It's the same clarity. It's the same—
It does match. No, I think the
mountain's gonna be... Oh, is that it? I think that might be it. We have to round it more. This is looking good. Yeah, see, now we're
at more of an angle. Now it fits. It feels... Yeah.
That feels definitive. That's the same mountain. Alright, well, Sam and Adam
are finally on their way. Which means it's time... to go back to my hiding spot. Because if they get
off their train here, then we enter the endgame,
and I want to be in my secret playground. So, now I just have to
remember how to get back there. I'm gonna go ahead
and hide under the... slide, because it's raining. Okay, they're just about
to pull into my station. Now the question is,
are they gonna get off? Alright, I think really quick before he can curse us,
Sam, ask for a photo. Okay. I don't know why he
hasn't cursed us. Yeah, I'm kinda
surprised by that. Hopefully we're in
the right spot. Let's see if we can find... something that matches
the photo. Is it the back of this thing? No... There it is. Is that it? That's it. Let's get his ass. Ladies and gentlemen... We got him.
We got him. Okay, they've
just requested a... the photo of my face. Which means that I think
they know that I am here. I gotta take a nice, good
photo of my face. I guess let's head
into the town, you know? Yeah. Oh, wait, that feels
pretty useful. (chuckles)
What is that? I don't know,
but that feels like something that we
would be able to find. Yeah, we can
probably find that. Almost looks like,
I don't know, like a playground slide,
or I don't know, but... (sighs) I mean... he's gotta be
cursing us any minute. Why didn't he? No, I mean, I think
that that's just a mistake. I've gone ahead and
sent them that photo. And now that we are
in the short game, I think that it may
finally be time ...to cast a curse. And we can afford ...three dice. So, let's see what we get here. Okay, that's a four,
a one, and a three. That is eight. Cheese rolling curse. Before you ask your next question, in a single roll, roll cheese
a distance of 30 feet. The cheese roll curse. Okay, well, you know what? That is probably pretty good, because that's gonna take 'em
a little while to do it. And I think that they're
gonna have to ask at least another
couple of questions before they actually find me. Go ahead and
roll that cheese, boys. So I'm kind of trying
to look out for those trees, along with whatever
this yellow— It's like an
orangish, semi-rusted... Okay, he cheese roll cursed us,
but I think we just ignore it. That curse is that
we have to do that before asking another question. I think it was a
huge mistake for him not to do a curse earlier
before we were in his zone and before we asked
a precision question. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What? I've been here. Wait, you've been here? Yeah. I thought you
found where he was. Why have you been here? I came here on my run
from Lucerne, on Sunday. Okay, and here's
what I was noticing. Okay, okay. I noticed— You ran here from Lucerne? Yeah.
How far is this from Lucerne? It was 7.5 miles out. I was running by,
and I was thinking, I wish we were filming
right now, because... What are these? Oh, yeah, I don't know. I cannot for the life of me
figure out what these are. And I want the
comments section to tell me. Still not the right spot, guys. No secret playgrounds there. Don't dilly-dally. Every minute matters. I have truly no idea. Even a little bit.
It's so baffling. They have these little
spinny things at the top? They're certainly
not windmills. No.
With the spinny things. I was thinking maybe
lightning rods or something? Oh, that could be it. Maybe for this construction, but I've never seen that
anywhere else. I would buy lightning rods. Anyway, comments section,
please tell me. I'm so confused. Anyway. I remain a
little bit skeptical that we can find him
with just that info. Well, I think— Let's do— Let's kind of give
the town a once over. Yeah, it's not big. Alright, well, they're
working their way towards me. But I think they are no match
for the secret playground. You know, you've gotten this far, but your hardest test
still awaits you. Can you find
the secret playground? I think the thing that
I'm looking at is there are some pretty
clear trees behind him that are only in some areas. So we know that he's not here. Yeah. Because we don't have
trees like that. And it seems like
the two options are... that he's down by the water,
or up a bit. Yeah, I mean,
that thing that's above him looks pretty distinctive. Yes, once we see it, I think we're gonna be
able to tell for sure. I think let's head
down towards the water. And if it doesn't seem
like it's like that, then maybe head up a bit. There's a playground here. 'Cause we thought
it could be a playground. Okay, it looks like
they're by a school. They're probably checking out if I'm at the playground
by the school. I probably should've picked
a less creepy hiding place than under a child's slide. But it's all about strategy, okay? I'm trying to win here. I'm trying to win
a very important game. We can't worry about
the way that this might look to... strangers, okay? I need... to not get found
by two boys. No. Slide is green. Well, we might be able
to get a good view from here. Yeah. Unless are we... Are we infiltrating a preschool? This might be a preschool. I think it's a preschool.
Yeah, it's a preschool. It's fine. Oh, there are kids, okay.
There are kids, there are kids. Let's...
Nope, nope, nope. I think that
they're trying to do this without asking another question so that they don't have
to get rid of their curse, which is a bold strategy. And I would argue, probably... not gonna work? I think they're gonna have
to ask another question to find me, but we'll see. I think let's check out
the water view. But I feel good about the
ability to identify this tree. 'Cause I'm—
All of these trees I'm immediately looking at and
being like, it's not this tree. 'Cause this tree is
uniquely pointy. I don't know, I mean, look. A circle with a mile in
diameter is still pretty big. Do you remember what exactly
the parameters of that one is? 30 feet. 30 feet? Yeah.
That's a lot. 30 foot roll. Ah, no, I want to
keep looking, personally. Well, the grocery store's
closed until 2:30 anyway. Uh-oh. I still feel like
this will be quicker. Okay. 'Cause... Look, there are only
so many trees. Again, the tree
I'm less convinced by. I'm more convinced by that
we can find a big orange rod. That too, the combination.
But this tree... Look how pointy and
upwards this tree is in comparison to
all of these trees. Sure. It's a quite distinctive shape. Okay. You keep your eye out
for the trees, and I'm keeping my eye out
for the orange thing. Well... I don't have
a keen eye for trees. I think let's head up. Okay. Okay, they are getting closer. They're going up the right street. That worries me a little bit. Uh-ooh. Turn the wrong way.
Turn the wrong way. Turn the wrong way.
Turn the wrong way. Turn the wrong way.
Turn the wrong way. Please turn the wrong way. Don't go towards me.
Okay, okay. Okay, they went the wrong way. Actually... You like this path?
This little path. It's a publicly accessible path, which would make sense
for him to be on. Oh wow, this is interesting. It looks like they are
checking the hiding place that I was gonna hide in before I found this playground. Okay, so I've been
looking around town, trying to find...
a good hiding spot. And as far as I can tell, the best hiding spot would be to lodge myself in that
bush there, nice and good. Just really get up in there. Are you going to
find me in that bush? I don't think so. There's a slide. Yeah, but it's not that. I know, I'm just... pointing it out. You know, honestly, just... This playground here is
not a crazy hiding space. This is pretty far up and
pretty far out of the way too. I think if I hid here, it would take them a
decent while to find me. But I'm gonna keep looking. Let me Google
parks and playgrounds. Yeah. Nothing comes up
for playground. I assume probably not
this one either, right? Nothing comes up for park. Yeah, it's too small, I think. Yeah, okay. So what's down this way? Well, I think we
want to go this way. Okay. We have just passed
hour seven, and they are still wandering
aimlessly in the hills. One thing to also point out is that you can see the
playground from Google Maps. So, if they really scour
Google Maps, the satellite, they should be able to
figure out where I am. The one thing
that I keep thinking is there are all these little
cut-throughs and paths and stuff. Uh-huh. And that would make a lot
of sense as somewhere to hide. Uh-huh. Actually, you know
what we haven't done? What? We haven't just
looked at the satellite map for a big yellow thing. That's true. You can look—
You can see that slide. But, okay, this is interesting. The Google Maps satellite shows a different slide here. It's actually outdated.
So if they use that, they might think that
this isn't the playground. Ooh. Ooh. That's an area
we haven't looked at. Although I don't see trees. No, but the trees
could be behind him. I bet it could be those trees. Yeah, it's kind of far though. How far is it? Well, it's not too far. It's the area we want to
check out anyway. Let's head that way. Yeah. It doesn't look like
there's anything that would match. No. But you'll notice... You start to see the trees
manicured in the right way. It's all in the trees, you see? The trees, what? The trees. No, I know.
It's all in the trees. Now that we're getting
mostly by trees, and with the grocery store
still closed – preventing us from
clearing our curse – we continue to wander
with less and less luck. In retrospect, I really
should have picked a spot that I was willing
to actually stay in for more than five minutes. Because the ground is so cold. And I look so stupid. And if anyone shows up here... I mean, frankly, I don't know
what the laws are here, but I feel like... if you see a fully-grown man
just sitting under a slide, you should be able to kill him. So... Hopefully that doesn't happen. At a certain point,
we should ask a local. Yeah.
We should be like, ""Do you know what this is?"" Okay, they are getting closer. I mean, Sam is... directly in front of that building. But I don't think that he can see
the playground from there. I don't think that there's a way— In ten minutes,
we can get our cheese and ask another question. So, I think let's poke this way
and then get the cheese. Yeah. No, it seems like
they have passed me. Okay. Oh, that was a close call. They were this close. They were literally... They were just in front of
these two buildings here. If those buildings weren't there,
they would've caught me. Well, we have
now taken long enough that the grocery store is back
open from its lunch break. So we can probably
clear our curse and ask some
additional questions. Which seemingly
we're gonna need to. Yeah, I mean— How have we not found him?! This place is not big! Alright, Sam. Cheese. I mean, this is a wheel. Yeah. That makes sense.
Want that? Yeah. Let's do that. Alright, how do you feel
about your cheese rolling ability? I feel pretty good about mine,
for what it's worth. Here, this is pretty good. This would work. Yeah. Let's go with this. I feel extremely confident.
Do you want to do it? I'll do it.
You got to do the apple. I feel extremely confident. Okay. Here we go. Well, that was easy. Wait, get the cheese! Get the cheese! (giggles) No! No! I think now we just
flood him with stuff. Which one would
we want to do next? Let's get the letter that
his nearest street starts with. Is that going to be useful? Most of the streets
start with 'S' or 'R'. But I do think it would be useful. I mean, if you think so. Yeah, I mean,
it would exclude a lot. So, it seems like they have
finally gotten rid of their curse. 'Cause they just asked me
for my street letter. We'll see what they do
with that information. It's an S, okay. There's a lot of Ss.
Well, there are a lot of Ss. Okay, do we want
to fire another one? Maybe, well, let's look. Okay, well, there's two key— There's— Stutzerstrasse?[stoot-strah-tz] Which we did look a good bit. And then there's...
this whole thing here. Which, we didn't— Seeplatzweg? Okay. Maybe let's just
go check that out, since we're so close.
So wait, Seeplatzweg? Yeah, we're so close. Okay, let's go
check out Seeplatzweg. Doesn't seem like this fits,
but I just want to be 100% sure. Sure is pretty. I mean, I don't see
how he could be here. So let's check out
that other one. I think we checked here. Did we check this path? Yeah, but that would
be a different road. Because this is a different road. So that wouldn't hit here. Okay, it seems like they're
going down the right street. But are they gonna see
the entrance to the playground? Because you can't see the
playground from the street. I don't know. Maybe they'll try it? We'll see. This might— This might be about to be
the end of my round. I think it's either this,
or there's another one here. Yeah, well, there's also little poke-outs over there. So let's circle back up
and come down these. (anguished)
I think we looked here. I'm pretty sure. No, we already checked here. We already checked
both of those. And this is the end
of Stutzerstrasse. They went right past it. I mean, they went
right past the entrance. Oh my god. I don't, I mean, I don't know
how they're gonna find me. They're just gonna have
to go back and notice it. Wanna sit down on
the bench for a second and figure out what next? Yeah. We're sure there's not just
a very little Ben under there? Right? He's not the tallest
guy in the world. We sat down to thoroughly
scour Google Maps, but after 15 minutes of looking,
came up empty. So, we decided to buy
some more information. We could ask how many
minutes would it take for you to walk to your
nearest train station? That's interesting.
Let's ask that. The answer is
only eight minutes. So now they know that
I'm not up in the hills. You'd think that this
would have helped us more. But it turns out, not so much. So we sat down on
another bench and asked another question. I just don't understand. I agree. I totally agree. Do you want to photo up,
just to see if that gives us anything? Maybe there will be a building. I guess. But, I mean, we have a
pretty good upward angle. But I guess. The picture
gave us some info on what Ben's
nearby buildings look like, which got us close. (wheezes)
He's not in a magical place. It's just a place. We should be able to find him.
He's in Gringotts. But, we once again
missed the entrance by a few hundred feet. Maybe he just... like we said, found a really
unintuitive path somewhere. Yeah, he must've.
Ben must be getting bored. (slow ticking clock) So, for a third time,
we sat down on a bench to try to figure out
what we could be missing. Maybe... (sighs) Well have we looked, Sam... Have we looked here? I can't tell what that is. That's... there. I'm not sure. I think we have,
but maybe not? Maybe. Maybe we should
go check it out? Yeah. That's eight minutes. Look. That path says it's
eight minutes. Okay.
I think it might be that path. You want to check it out? Yeah, yeah, ugh. We must just... This way? I think we might've missed it. It's down this street. It's down and then it's
over there, I think. That has to be it. Well, I feel like we've
said that a lot of times. Here, we can
cut down this way. Actually, look,
cut down the other way. You know what's gonna
be awesome is the... motion graphic map
that shows us walking within 100 feet of it
six times. You're getting awfully confident. So it's this one here? No, it's to the right. It's around this bend,
and then it's a left. Oh, I see.
There's the hedge. There's a hedge. This. We haven't been
down this. I don't think
we've been down this. Oh, (bleep) I think I might fit.
Smoke stacks. I think it might fit. There's the damn slide. Oh my god. That (bleep)-ing guy. Hi.
This sucked! (growls crazily) Alright, Ben, give me the dice. Yes. Right now. Yes. I need more. You need more? I need more.
That's ambitious. This sucked. Yes. This sucked so much. It sucked for me too. I was sitting under
that slide for so long. Ben, what's the fastest way
to the train station? I think you... Through one of the—
Down and around. Alright, see you guys.
Good luck, Sam. We— I mean,
oh my god, dude. Hated this! Yeah, well,
that's the score to beat. Congratulations.
Thank you. I have a little surprise for you. Goodness.
Look what I got. Glühwürmchen! I had really good
fondue last night. This is awesome.
Let's go right now. There's also
one restaurant in town, and it serves really good fondue. Let's go there, and
then let's go to the hotel. Okay. We got fondue. We're talking about the plan. Okay, so we've been
talking about tomorrow. The situation is
we really need to find Sam. If we don't find Sam tomorrow, then we both lose, because... That'll mean that his run
is longer than my run. And that Adam
won't get another run, because in order to get
a longer run than him, we wouldn't be able to nab him
before the end of the game. So the game will just be over. The game is four days. So we have to find him. Well, I've arrived in
what I think is going to be quite the annoying spot
for a bunch of reasons. All of which I will
explain in the morning. Good night! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Alright look,
the stakes are simple. If we don't catch Sam tomorrow, the game ends and he wins. Is that what's gonna happen? You could find out
right now on Nebula, because next episode is up
right now on Nebula, just like every week, because every episode
of Jet Lag goes up one week early on Nebula! And in addition to watching
next episode right now, you can also listen to our after-show podcast,
The Layover, where we get into the
behind-the-scenes. We dive into our strategy. And you're going to want
to hear a little bit about our strategy next round. 'Cause it's going to
get really important. And I think that we've
got a, you know... We've got a distinct strategy. And you'll find out
what it is next episode. Again, could find out
right now on Nebula. And we talk about it even
more on The Layover, so... Something to entice you.
Something to entice you. Are you enticed? If you're not enticed,
you might want to know that there's a whole bunch
more amazing stuff on Nebula from all of your favorite creators. We got Brian from
Real Engineering. You might remember
him from the show. We got Joseph from
RealLifeLore. You might remember
him from the show. We got Toby from the show. She's on there.
She's talking about math. Scotty's on the show also,
and on Nebula as well. You got all of
your favorite creators making original content on here. And people, guess what? It doesn't cost a million dollars. It's affordable. It's so dang affordable that it only costs $30
for the whole year. The whole year?
For the whole year. That's $2.50 a month, but... It only costs that
if you use our code. If you go to nebula.tv/jetlag because if you don't use our code,
then it's $50 for the year. Which is still a very good deal,
but is more than $30. And when you use our code, you're also helping
to support the show because that tells Nebula
that Jet Lag sent you. And then we get a portion
of your subscription for the whole time that
you stay subscribed, which helps us
to support the show. And that is good...
theoretically. Hopefully you would want us
to keep making the show ...if you're watching it.
That's true. So theoretically, this is
a win-win for everybody. You can fit so much
content in this bad boy. Can we put—
Okay, wait, I have an idea. And I want us to keep
all this in, okay. Post production team,
can you put a box that has 'Nebula' on it here, and then watch
what I'm going to do? You can fit so much
content in this bad boy! Well, that just sold me.
Yeah. You know, the link's on screen. You can see it right there. Just go ahead and click on it. It would be really good
if you did that. We would really like it
if you did that. And if you didn't do it,
we would be really sad. You can't say that!
It would be: If you don't click on it,
it's okay. But we would prefer it
if you clicked on it. Does that make sense? Yeah, I think that seems right. Mm. Okay, well bye.
Bye!"

hide-and-seek across Switzerland. In this game, the Seekers must
determine the Hider's location by buying information from them. In exchange for truthful answers, the Hider receives coins
that they can use to buy curses that will
slow the Seekers down. At the end of four days, the player with the longest
single hiding run wins. Last episode,
Adam was found in a castle in the mountain town
of Hospental after hiding for just over
four and a half hours. Now, it's up to Ben to see
if he can beat that time. He's got two and a half hours to get to a hiding spot
before his clock starts and the Seekers start
coming after him. There you go. Alright, two hours and
thirty minutes starts now. Oh!
Good bye. Hello, and welcome
to my hiding zone. Which will remain a mystery. Until they figure it out.
Or you figure it out. You'll probably figure
it out before them. You guys are smart. I did not have as much time
getting out of Hospental. I was starting from
a pretty remote spot. There also wasn't
a train for a while, so I really only had
about an hour, forty-five of actual train time. And that cut down
my options a lot. Also, I had to get down
from that freakin' castle. We are s-s-so back. We're back! I really did not want to have to climb up this thing
again, but we did do it. Oh, it's time, it's time. Okay so, Ben could have gone... Yes.
East, west, north, or south. The main directions, yeah. So seemingly, there's... one line west.
Yeah. There's one line south, but then it gets
complicated at the end. Yeah.
There's a line east that does some complication
at the end of that. Or, what I think would
be the smartest move would be to go north.
Yeah. Back towards Lucerne, because then you have
a lot more optionality. There's certainly
the most optionality, is by him having
gone north or south. We all keep talking
about Ben's limited options, so just to clarify: because Ben had to start his
two and a half hour hiding period from Adam's very out of
the way hiding place, he was pretty restricted
in how far he could get. Adam and I don't necessarily
know the limits precisely, but we can be pretty confident he's somewhere within
this rough blob. That's bad news for Ben, and things are about
to get even worse, because we have
a pretty sinister idea for our first question. We were discussing
during our break, and we had an idea. There is an oddball
question, which is: Send us five words. One of them has to
rhyme with your town. If you ask that at the beginning... then they have to
cover all their bases. So Ben will have to send us stuff from the north, the east,
the south, the west. Because he's gonna send stuff that rhymes with plausible
towns, most likely. Yeah, but then
once we narrow it down, there will probably be only one, two, maybe three towns that rhyme with whatever it is. So I think it makes sense
to start with that. Let's hit him with that
Let's hit him with that and let's talk about
the rest of the questions while we start
walking to the station. Alright, let's go.
Let's go. Okay. We have got our first purchase. It's an interesting one. It makes me feel like they're
probably pretty confident. (grunts) (sneezes) Ugh. Oh, we got an answer. Rug. Rug, so that rhymes
with Zug, which we know. Yeah, that's interesting. Awaken. Boxcar, Again, and Clam. It's interesting that... Zug[zoog] or Zug[zuhg] or whatever
that town is called. Yeah. That is a prime candidate. I do agree, Zug[zuwg] is
a highly attractive... It's almost just too obvious. Yeah, that's the only thing. Makes me think
it's the red herring, because it's like... It's pretty much exactly as
far as he could get that way. Right. Although, Sam, I think we need
to ask a relative question ASAP if we want to be able
to ask another one before we get to that decision. Yeah, what one
would we want to ask? I think that we
should do political party. Yeah. I mean, it's pretty
useful geography, I agree. Yeah, we can
explain why in a minute, but I think we need to ask it now. Okay, do you
want to go for that? Yeah, I think so. Okay, can you
text it or should I? I'm texting right now. Alright. Just real quick, this question
asked Ben if his canton – cantons are like
regions of Switzerland – voted for the same party as
our canton in the last election. Given the voting map and the blob
geography we're dealing with, this should roughly cut
Ben's options in half. A yes would mean he's
somewhere in here, and a no would mean
he's somewhere in here. Okay, they have asked
another question. They have asked
if my canton voted for the same political party
as their canton. That is gonna, I think, sort of slice down
the possible map in two. Smart question. It's fine. Ooh. His canton voted for
a different party. So that pushes towards— So that excludes all of the west. This is east or south
then, I think. Wait, so it couldn't be north? Let me confirm. Would Zug be a different party? Zug is different. Is Zug different?
Yeah, it's green. Whoa, okay. Here, once we get to the station, let's do some more research. Yeah. Okay, so we have... 13 minutes.
Okay. So we need to
decide, basically, what we do when we get
to Andermatt. Yeah. Let's look into it. I mean, for what it's worth, on the line going east, I don't see stuff
that cleanly rhymes. It doesn't, okay. What's 'boxcar' trying to do? We should look at
the weird ones. What's he trying to
do with 'boxcar'? What's 'clam' also? 'Cause here's what I'm saying.
Something has to end in— Cham. Cham rhymes with 'clam'. Which makes me think
even more he might be in Zug. Look... Merzingen, 'again'. Mhm. Cham, 'clam'. Zug, 'rug'. If there's a 'boxcar'... Baar, 'boxcar'. Mhm.
He's gotta be up there. I mean, it would be
a real big brain move to give us four things that weirdly rhyme with
stuff in that area. I mean, I guess you could do it to really try to throw us off,
and maybe it'll work. I just realized
I still have this apple. I gotta get rid of this. Well, I think it
certainly makes sense to – prevailing theory –
head towards there, right? Yeah. Oh (bleep),
we need to get outside. Oh. Oh, will it not stop
if we're not outside? No. Oh, (bleep). (train approaches rapidly) Is it not gonna stop at all? We'll see. For real? Okay... Adam and Sam still seem
to be in Hospental. Which... means to the
best of my knowledge, they... cannot get on a train... until 4:41, in half an hour. More than a half an hour. Which means that they won't
even leave Hospental until... an hour into my run, which... I mean, is a good start! Okay, so to
explain what happened... what we just learned is that
to make the train stop here, you have to press the little button. And if you don't press the button, the train does not stop. So now we have to wait, what, a half hour for the next train? Yes. Awesome. Anyway.
It's okay. It's ultimately not a huge deal. It's just annoying. Yes, and our fault. And for sure our fault. That's how the jets lag. That is how the jets lag. Okay, it's fine, it's fine. I think he's gotta be there. It's a little bit of a risk, though. It is a bit of a risk.
If he's (bleep)-ing with us. It certainly is a bit of a risk. Well, let's see.
Could we ask other stuff? Aren't all of these
(bleep) towns on the water? Pretty much, I think. Couldn't we ask
for a picture of a lake? I guess that's— wait. Photo questions are
relatively cheap, right? They're what, 20, 15?
15, yeah. I guess, yeah, it could be useful. And we can ask it now, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Whew, well... Adam and Sam
have requested a photo of my biggest body of water. Which is a pretty obvious one. It's this lake here. We're gonna use our best
photography skills to... be vague about this. Let's see here. I've taken a photo of the lake. I do think that I've
done a pretty good job of including
no defining features. It is probably pretty clear
that it's a lake. Although maybe
it's not even that clear. It's kind of hard to tell. The photo just looks like water. Oh, we got a photo. Well, that looks like a lake. It looks like a lake to me. 'Cause it has to be 100+ feet. So that's definitely not a river. No, that's not a river. So it seems to confirm north. I mean, everything
is pointing north. He's in the Zug area
for sure. I mean, I think we've
narrowed it down to... frankly, a pretty tight area. If we're right.
If we're right. I think we're right. Probably. Here's one thing I gotta do. I gotta get a place
to sleep here. Because here's a little hint
that I'm gonna give you guys. There is only one hotel
in this town. Okay, I found the hotel. It's kind of unbearably cute. (softly)
Look how Christmassy it is. Okay well, Adam and Sam
are still in Hospental. How does it feel, Adam? In the end having spent
the entire game day except for one hour
in this tiny town? Look, I love... I forgot what it's called. He's stopping! Oh, Ben. I mean, here's the thing. Ben was put in a very
unfortunate position by having to start here.
That's true. And that is part of
the strat, you know? I mean, look, it was not-not
part of why I went here. But also, I will remind you that last time
we were overconfident about Ben having potentially made himself too easy...
It's true, the last time we were overconfident... He, spoiler alert... He absolutely got us.
He won the game. We did get
absolutely got by Ben. Yes. They're never gonna find me. Fun fact, this is the bridge
where Ben and I knocked apples. Alright. Well, this is
as far as we can get. Yeah. There's nothing
more we can do. There is nothing
more we can do. It's 5:05. The game day ends at 5:30, but we can't get any further. And I don't think we want
to buy any more information. No, I think we want
to wait until we're closer to ask any more questions. We don't want to give
him the potential to curse us, you know, in a way that could be
really disruptive. But I think that's
probably it for today. I think that's it. Here, do a funny stand. You gotta do a funny... Oh, do an awesome pose? Yeah, do an awesome pose
that you're gonna do in the morning. Is that awesome?
Uh-huh. Alright, now wave good night. And if you say good night. Good night! Good night. Okay, well, it seems
that Sam and Adam have ended the day in Göschenen. And I have ended the day
here, in my hotel room. I've set up my strategy... and now we just have
to see if it works. We'll just see what happens. Now it's time for
the first rest period. Each day at 5:30 pm, the game pauses so that
players can eat and sleep and not be in the
freezing cold for a bit. We'll restart the
next day at 7:30 am, exactly where we left off. Good morning! We are so frickin' back. We're back, baby! Our train towards Zug
doesn't leave for, what, 25-30 minutes?
25 minutes or so. Not the best.
Not the best. Anyway, let's do some strategy. So... We think we're
going to the right place. Look, here's the thing. Either Ben did an absolutely
nuts, big brain move... Which he has in the past. And he's done it in the past. Or... we know basically
the region where he is. And probably have it
narrowed down to two towns. What I would say is, assuming that we do
know where he is... he both was unlucky that he was in a place
with unique names that don't rhyme with a lot. And I would also argue that
he made a tactical error by giving specific— words that only
specifically rhymed with weird places
that were right there. Yes, I mean,
the one variable is, what if he did that specifically
to send us to that place that kind of seems pretty
obvious as a place for him to go, based on the timing
where he left from? But we don't think so. (slower)
We don't think so. We don't think so. W e  d o n ' t  t h i n k  s o . Okay. This is a very
interesting first one. They've asked for five words. One of which has to rhyme
with the name of my town. Here's the thing,
I kind of want to... send them up towards Zug. So I'm gonna try that. Oh, we got an answer. Rug.
Rug. So that rhymes with Zug[zuhg],
which we know. Yeah, that's interesting. I do agree Zug[zuug] is
a highly attractive... That would be a pretty big... big brain gamer move. But the lake!
But what about the lake? (slower)
What about the lake? What about the lake? W h a t  a b o u t  t h e  l a k e ? Adam and Sam have requested a photo of my
biggest body of water. I'm trying to send them to towns that are on a different lake
than the lake that I'm on. So I just need to make this lake
feel fairly nondescript. Oh, we got a photo. Well, that looks like a lake. It looks like a lake to me. It seems to confirm north. I mean, everything
is pointing north. He's in the Zug area, for sure. That's a good point.
I admit, that's a good point. We'll see. Alright, let's get on the train. Good morning. I'm back here in my hotel room. And we have just gotta
keep hiding. And hopefully... they go to the wrong lake
this morning. That's... If they go to the
wrong lake, then... then I'll be happy
with my strategy. If they go to the wrong lake, then I will have done at least
one smart thing on this run. And that's kind of my standard... for this game.
As long I can do at least one smart thing
every run... I'll be happy. So, let's see if
I can keep that up. Sam, look,
it's getting less snowy. We are out of the slush zone. We're out of the slush zone and headed to the Zug zone.
This is so exciting. I think we gotta start
poking around this morning to see if we can find
our final hiding spot. So yeah, let's just go
on a little adventure and find ourselves a spot. Look at all those mountains. I do see the mountains, yes. It's a great point. Alright, so do we
definitely want to do... photo of train station? Do we want to look
at the options? Yeah, how about
let's take a quick look. Okay, so now that
Adam and I are headed to the area
we believe Ben is, we're hoping to find a cheap
way to confirm his location. After some discussion, we decided to ask for a
photo of his local town hall, figuring that once we get to Zug, we'll be able to see if it
matches the town hall there. So, should we go ahead
and do that? Yeah, let's request
a picture of the town hall. Whew, I'm getting
further up into the hills. I've made it pretty
far out up here. And honestly, I think
if I hid this far up, it's just going to be
too obvious that I'm up on top of this hill. I think I need to be more... in the town. 'Cause there's just gonna be
more actual hiding spots. So I don't think that
I want to go this high. The Seekers have requested a photo of my town hall, but... as far as I can tell,
looking at the maps and doing some googling, I actually don't think that
there is a town hall here. Hello. Does this town have a town hall? Great. Thank you so much. Okay. He said that there
is not a town hall... Within his radius.
Within his zone. Which either means he has
a rather unintuitive zone... Which is possible, but he— We know that the water
is in his zone. Maybe he set it specifically
to exclude town hall. Tsk. It's possible. Just a quick note about zones. The Hider cannot go
more than half a mile from the spot they were when
their official time started. The area they have to stay in
is called the Hiding Zone. The rules say there has to be a
train station in the Hiding Zone. But otherwise, depending on
where the Hider centered it, the zone's limits might make certain photo requests
impossible to fulfill. I'm a little worried that
with that last question... knowing that there's not
a town hall in my zone... It might make it pretty obvious which town I'm in. Because I'm definitely
in the smallest town that is among
the remaining towns. Or, he could be
in a really small place that really doesn't seem
to have a town hall. I guess, but it'd
have to be very small, I think, to not have
a town hall. I kind of think that maybe
he's in lower Zug. Maybe.
I'm just saying, if he got off here... he could have transferred and
gotten to Oberwil-bei-Zug. Yeah.
Which is lower Zug. And that... would probably not
have a Zug town hall. Oh yeah.
It's separate. Is it still around Zug? Yeah, it's still around Zug,
and it would still be a town hall. Yeah. But he could also be at
Zug-Fridbach, Zug-Casino. There are multiple stops
in lower Zug. Mhm. And would it still
count as Zug the city? Yeah, this is all Zug. I think we do the train station. Check out Zug. And... maybe check out other ones,
or maybe ask him more. You know, honestly, just... this playground here is
not a crazy hiding space. This is pretty far up and
pretty far out of the way too. I know, but I'm gonna
keep looking. Okay, now they've requested
a train station pic. I think if I'm... clever about the way
that I take this picture... There are certain parameters... for how we take the picture. But I think if
I'm clever about it... I can hopefully not
give away too much. Well, the train station is... hardly a station, but... I'll do my best. Oh, this is interesting. The back of the train station
looks very different ...than the front of
the train station. That... could be useful. Because then,
if they go past this, they might take one look
at this train station and be like, ""Oh, it's not
made out of this orange wood."" Okay, let's try that. Yeah. I think that could be
pretty sneaky. Okay, so we
just got this picture. We are going to pass through several stations south of Zug, but we just won't stop at them. But we can hopefully,
we look really closely. If we notice that red color,
that reddish orange. We're about to
pass through one. Okay, which side? Here, I'll look at this side.
You look at that side, okay? (hisses softly) Didn't seem like it. I mean, it was kind
of just hard to tell. Yeah. Although it didn't
feel like any of those. It didn't really feel like it. It would have that. Which makes me think that... Maybe we should
go west first? At least if we
don't have other info. (sighs) Yeah. Well here, let's— We're at Zug station now. So let's check here out
just quickly and then go from there. Well, I just took
a look at the tracker, and I am afraid... That's the wrong way,
Sam and Adam! Have fun in Zug! But that is not where I am. Ouch! Alright, let's investigate
here quickly first. Okay, this is not looking good.
It's definitely not this. After walking
around the station, it became clear Zug
didn't match the photo. So Adam and I started looking at more rural stations
just west of Zug. There were two contenders that
wouldn't include the town hall: Zug Chollermüli and
Cham Alpenblick. So we quickly hopped on
a train to give them a look. Okay, go. No. Next one? No. It doesn't have any
sort of siding on it. Alright, so
getting off here, right? Yeah. Yeah, 'cause any further— 'Cause one stop further
is Cham, which would have a town hall
as far as I can tell. And it's the theoretical
limit for this run. And any further than that... Yeah.
Yeah. Eh. It's a different style of siding, but it's got the right vibes. Okay, so it's
definitely not that way. Well, it seems like it's
for sure not this side. Can you check the next train? There's a train now. We can get on that, can't we? We might. Well, we're not going to be able
to fully check it out, but... Okay, I think we need to
decide on another question. (sighs) Okay. So, I've been
looking around town, trying to find
a good hiding spot. I'm really feeling like
this walking trail might be my best bet. I'm liking this.
This is my leading theory. I'm really liking this spot here. Ohh, okay. Status report. I am so hungry. But the only food that
this town has is fondue. And I think if I eat
any more fondue, something really bad is
going to happen to me. Although, the hungrier I get, the more that I hope
that they catch me. Because then I can go
eat something. So, you know,
chop-chop, guys. Come on. I think we just need
to decide on another question. We could ask for
a picture of something. For example, a church. But there's gonna be so many. Right. We could ask for a picture... Feels like we probably— ...where at least five buildings
are visible to get a vibe. But that's kind of just a vibe. Maybe an oddball. I mean, maybe we just
hit him with a... We ask him for... the Strava on the streets thing, and just see if that
gets us anything. 'Cause if he's in one of these
really weird little places... Yeah. I don't hate that. How much does that cost?
Only ten. Yeah, it could be...
not be bad, yeah. Let's do that. I think that might work. I mean, it could
certainly help narrow it down. Given that I think
he must be in a small area, I think we could match
whatever the pattern is to places that don't
have a lot of roads. Right, yeah, hopefully. Okay, I'm into it. Okay, they have requested
for me to trace the streets. Making at least six turns. I'm not really gonna run,
because again, I'm full of cheese. But... I'll get it done for them. Well, at least
that was efficient. Yeah. Hopefully it was
conclusive, but... I mean, it felt conclusive. Felt relatively conclusive. So... I think let's head south now? I guess we might as well,
while we wait for the answer. Yeah, I mean, yeah, while we wait for him
to do that Strava thing, I think we might as well
head south. I mean, look, it's also
technically possible we're not in
the right area at all. True. This does seem like a
pretty smart question to ask, given that... this town has pretty
distinctly shaped streets. If they're looking at this town, they should be able to figure out
that these are the streets. Which is a little spooky. Oh, he just sent us
the Strava thing. Okay, that's interesting. This does not seem to
match any of the Zugs as far as I can tell. Wait, does it match
this southern Zug? No. Okay, so I'm really starting to kind of question our
assumptions here. Because... I think there's a lot more
places he can be than we thought. I think that we got
too focused on the Zug area. And now I'm starting
to think that maybe he could be somewhere
quite different. For example, if he got
off at Arth-Goldau... He could have gone
east, for example, to Steinen,
which does have a lake. Yeah, I mean, he could
definitely have made it to Steinen In time.
Right, and that would be an interesting and
unexpected move. Let me see if
that matches Steinen. This looks, this is
giving me Steinen vibes. And it certainly has—
It has the right— The whole town has
the right... Curviness. See, this main road... I don't know, it feels Steinen-y. Yeah, I mean,
I think it's gonna be impossible to 100% match,
but I agree that the style of roads... looks like that. Well, wouldn't Steinen
have a town hall? Actually, look. Look how far that is
outside of the city. That's more— That's definitely
more than a half mile. Oh, wow. I'm already getting
real close to... to beating Adam's time here. And, you know, I still... I don't think that barely
beating Adam's time is gonna give me
a winning run for the whole game, but... It'll put me in the lead, at least. We'll just have to see. Really, it's gonna be
a question of how long it takes them
to figure out that they need to 
get out of Zug. 'Cause Zug and those
surrounding towns? That's not where they
want to be. There are gravel sections outside that station. Uh-huh. I mean, this is probably
a lot of confirmation bias, but... So, it seems like
they have figured out that I'm not in the Zug area. And they are heading
back towards me. So, I think it's time for us
to go get in position. 'Cause, I mean, if they're
heading straight for me, they're gonna be here
within the hour. Ugh. We've discovered
something bad. Yes, the shadow is... Yeah.
...not a lake. Yeah, so
we discovered that in Steinen... This, we really thought
this was a lake, but it actually—
Well, big 'we' there. Well, I thought it was a lake, and it turns out
it was a shadow. You looked at it, and you
thought it was a lake, too. No, I didn't.
Did you not? No, I just trusted you. What about... okay. Steinen has a lake down here, but I don't think it
would be within his zone. Well, it might be. Unless he had
purposefully gone south. Which I don't know why he
would have to set his radius. Maybe to include less of
the town or something, but it seems like a stretch. (sighs heavily) This for sure has
the vibes of a place that would have a train station
that looks like that. There's the lake. Okay. I don't know. If he walked
even just a little bit... he could be within
the area of the lake. I'm just saying. I have just been informed
that that walking path is very much
private property, so... I've gotta very quickly find
another hiding spot. Oh god. This is not, this is not... Oh, this is not good. This is not good. Ohh. (bleep) If he's not—
If this is not it, I couldn't tell you
where to go next. Caption+ by JS*

Additional Game Design by Amy Muller","E8UmTJVDnUI","Hello! This is where I'm hiding. Good luck finding me here! We're playing hide-and-seek
across Switzerland over the next four days. We're starting in Lucerne
as the Seekers... ...while I got a
two and a half hour lead to get to my hiding spot here. Yeah, I think this is
gonna take them a while. Welcome to our four-day game of hide-and-seek
across Switzerland. The goal is simple: Hide for as long as we can
without being found. Based on a random draw, Ben and I are starting
as the Seekers. We're in Lucerne,
and Adam, the Hider is... well, we don't know.
In order to figure it out, we'll have to buy information
from him about his location, choosing from the 76 questions
on our giant question menu. Adam has to answer
truthfully, but in exchange, he'll get coins that he can use to buy curses
that will slow us down. Once we find Adam,
positions will rotate, and it'll be someone else's
turn to hide. After four days,
whichever player has had the single longest hiding run wins. We'll get more into the
other rules once they're relevant. Right now, Adam's clock is ticking. So Ben and I need to figure out
what information we should buy, so we can start heading
in Adam's direction. Okay, so right now,
Adam could be pretty much anywhere
in the country. Yeah, he got a two
and a half hour head start. Do you have any guesses, Sam? Because it would be great if we didn't have to
ask any questions. Well, I mean there is logic
to going to higher elevations, so that this is snow. Okay, so, they're
probably gonna start buying information
off of me soon. So I'm gonna go ahead
into town, because... some of the questions
involve having to do stuff. And I think most of it's
gonna be easier if I'm there. So, let's go. Okay. Okay, so we're there. Adam is... we don't know. Probably like... (laughs) He could be
anywhere within here. Yeah. Now there are a lot of
questions we can ask. There are different categories. Okay, let's talk
about the categories. There are five types of
information we can buy. Relative information
compares some element of the Hider's position
to the Seekers': whether their elevation is
higher or lower than ours, whether they're in the
same canton, and so on. The radar allows Seekers to find out whether or not the Hider is
within a certain distance from us: 50 miles, 10 miles,
500 feet, et cetera. Photo requests force the Hider to send a picture of something
in their hiding zone, like the tallest visible mountain, a local church,
or the train station. Oddballs force the Hider
to complete some task that might give away
some information. For example,
FaceTime the Seekers until you can show them a bird, send them 30 seconds of audio
from your local train station, things like that.
And finally, once the Seekers find
the town where the Hider is, they'll use precision questions to pinpoint their exact location. Here's the thing. I think that we need
a direction to go. I think we want
to ask longitude to figure out whether
he's east or west of us. 'Cause we're basically smack dab
in the middle of the country, so that'll split it into two. Okay.
Yeah. So we're gonna buy
that piece of information, and then we'll see what he says. Okay. So they have just bought
my relative longitude. I don't love that. I would've much rather they
asked my relative latitude, 'cause that's much less useful. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Probably. (sigh) I'll text them. Okay, Adam has said that he... His longitude is higher. Which means he is east of us. Okay, that's really
good to know, because... the eastern part of the country,
it's more nothing. Yeah, I mean,
except for Zürich. There's the whole Zürich city. Look, I got a gut feeling,
if I know Adam, you know, we're like those twins
that have the secret language, that we can talk with the minds.
Sure, sure. I feel like he's
in the mountains. I feel like he went
to the mountains. Oh, there's a
snowplow coming up here. Hello. Hello, friend. Well, okay. If he is in the mountains,
then what do we do? 'Cause the mountains
would be south of us, whereas the populated bit
would be north of us. I mean, is there any way
for us to head straight east? Not really, I don't think. Maybe it's worth
asking another question whether he's south or north. Yeah, we're just
killing time though. We are killing time. I mean, every minute matters. But the problem is—
I know. I think— If we go the wrong way... Yo, you're right.
I think yeah, maybe north-south makes sense. I mean, when can we ask that? Five minutes. Whoa, look.
It's a little stone guy. Hello, little stone guy. This place rocks. Alright, we're just
gonna go to the train station. It's just right over here. Alright, I think it's time. We don't really know whether
we want to go towards Zürich, or we want to go down
into the mountains. So we're gonna ask if he's north or south of us. Alright, I'm firing it off. Go for it. Alright, so they've
asked for my relative latitude, so that's another 40 coins.
That's good. So that does tell them
that I'm in the southeast, which is a
relatively sparse area. I don't necessarily love that
they know that this early. I mean, I'll let them know. Oooh. What'd he say?
South. I told you. He's in the mountains. So here's the issue. If Adam's in the southeast, it means he took either this
small isolated line to Engelberg or this busier route to
the greater southeast. We don't know which he took, but if we wanna move now,
which we really should, we'll have to gamble and pick one. So I think we just
gotta gamble, I think. If we want to move, which
I think it makes sense, we gotta gamble. I think it would be
crazy for us to commit to one town,
two questions in. It would be, but
of course he knows that. I know he knows that! I think it does make more sense to take the higher frequency thing because it'll be
high frequency enough that we can bail and come back. Yeah, okay, let's do that. Okay. That means Adam's not there. Does that make sense? There's some
little elf guys on there. This place is full of little guys. Here's a little guy there.
Hello. Okay, so this is almost
certainly gonna jinx me, but... I think the key to this hiding spot is I really don't
want them to know how much snow is here for as long as possible. The worst questions for that, the one I'm really
scared of, which... I'm for sure gonna jinx myself, is they make me
send them a picture of five buildings
in the same frame. 'Cause I don't think the
buildings here are dense enough... that I'd be able to take a picture without any snow in it. I think we should
ask a photo question. Yeah, a photo question
might be helpful. Okay, yeah. Let's buy a photo from him. What kind of photo do you
wanna buy from him, Sam? (marker rubbing) I mean, the five buildings one. Maybe? I feel like that one's
the most likely to give us some sort of incidental
information. Right. I'm gonna go ahead
and tell you right now... incredibly slippery here. One of the slipperiest
places I've ever experienced. We're gonna just
for sure not die walking on the street, please. I'm gonna go inside
this little restaurant. So I think five buildings one.
I think you're right. Most incidental information likely. (sigh) Okay.
If we do that one. Let's go ahead and buy
that photo from him. We'll analyze it
while we're on our way. Well, this sucks. Okay, we got 20 minutes
to do the best we can. Okay, okay, okay. Okay.
So the key to this is... Is there a way that
I can frame five buildings that doesn't reveal that
there is a ton of snow here? The answer is, I don't know. (bleep bleep bleep) Alright, so this is
three buildings. Yeah, that's nothing. I could shoot down this way, but you can totally
see all the snow. Oh, this sucks.
This sucks. This sucks. This is the exact one
I didn't want. One, two, three,
four, five. I think if I zoom just right... I can... yeah. That's pretty good. Okay, done.
Send, sending. Sent. Oh, there we go. We got the photo. That is quite the tight framing. I mean, those buildings
do look mountainous. But the other thing I'm noticing
is they look very new. They look very clean.
They look very new. They also look dry. What? Yes. Yeah. Okay... I actually feel pretty good
about how that went. I kinda didn't think I was
gonna be able to do it, but... I mean, that's five
buildings cleanly in there. No snow, so... That actually is a huge relief. Yeah, so my conclusions
are mountainous town... and potentially, given how
new these buildings look, a touristy town. Yeah, somewhere
pretty wealthy. We're looking at
two sort of similar... nearby towns
that both seem like sort of Swiss resort towns. One is called Engelberg, and one is called Andermatt. And we don't wanna
get too far from here if he is in Engelberg,
'cause we would've to go all the way back around
to get to him. So, I actually think that
the tool to use right now... would be a 25-mile radar, because if he was in Engelberg, that would hit him. But if he was in Andermatt
or anywhere other than here in this little region,
it wouldn't hit him. Mmh. I guess it's worth it. I think it's worth it to know whether we
should continue or not. Yeah, no, it's pretty valuable, 'cause that could mean hours of difference. I think that we
need to just make sure. Okay, should I send it? Yeah. Alright. Let's go explore
a little bit more. And let's also scope out some potential
final hiding spots. 25 mile. Okay, well they have hit me
with a 25-mile radar. Ha-ha! I am gonna let them know. Alright, we got a response. Ooh.
Okay. Our radar is a miss. It means that
he's not in Engelberg. It means that we didn't
make the wrong decision getting on this train. I don't think... Need to pull out our
very scientific map again. It doesn't seem like
he could have really gotten into this canton here. So that means that
he's probably either in this one or this one. We're gonna be in this one, which is called Uri, right? Yes. We're gonna be
in that one soon. So we could check and
see if he's in that one. Yeah, yeah. Might be worth it. Just worried about
spending all these coins. 80... 110... I have 125 coins. So that's enough
for two curse dice. Wait, curse dice? Alright, alright. Let's finally talk about
what these coins are for. In order to slow us down, Adam can use his coins
to buy curses. Many curses force the Seekers
to complete challenges before continuing to
move or ask questions. Others place harsh
limitations on their movement or what questions they can ask. And the very best curses
can even allow the Hider to completely change
their hiding location. But Adam doesn't just get to pick which curse he wants to buy. When you buy a curse, you roll dice to see
which one you get. The higher the number,
the better the curse. For a better shot at
a high-tier curse, you can pay more to
roll more dice, at 50 coins apiece. So 100 coins to roll two dice, 150 coins to roll
three dice, and so on. Now, back to Adam. And I kinda think I should... use them? Let's get to some shelter. You think the church is open? (whispers) Whoa. So I kinda think
what I want to do is wait until they're on a train. And then roll the dice. Okay, they're on the train. Let's do it. Let's do it. Okay, let's do it. So I'm gonna buy two dice... and roll both of them. I'll add that number
together... and hope that it's
a high number. (dice rolls on bench) (dice rolls on ground) (dice rolls on ground) Seven. William Tell Curse. Before you ask your next question, you must knock an apple
off your partner's head from a distance of 15 feet. If you fail, you must wait
five minutes before trying again. (chitters) Ahh, this rocks. Look at the mountains. Look how pointy that is. That's very pointy. I feel like the mountains
we have in the US are not that pointy. No, the Alps are
definitely pointier, which is a big feature. Sam, we've gotten
hit with a bit of a curse. William Tell. Good news, he used
two dice to get that. Yeah. And that's a pretty
bad one to have got. That's literally the lowest—
Well, actually no, that's not. But it's a pretty low one
to have gotten for two dice. That doesn't
worry me that much. No. Considering
the William Tell curse, and also considering
how much of the canton we've excluded based on
the 25-mile radius... Check it out, this is, we use science
to determine that. Considering all of that... it kind of makes sense for us to seemingly go all the way
down to Göschenen because that's where
we would transfer to a lot of stuff that we
would want to get to anyway, and we can get the
apple curse cleared, and then ask more
questions based on that. (mouth click) They're continuing
to get closer. I don't love that. So... I think let's keep looking
for potential hiding spots. It's snowy. (chime)
(door opening) It's theoretically possible
that he could be here. He could be here. So we should, you know,
watch out for the architecture. Here's the thing. There are a bunch of these
little mountain towns in this sort of stretch. And, my guess... is that he's in one of them. Yes.
In this area. Because if he went further down, all the way down to Lugano, that's— it looks like... Italy, you know? It's really...
Mediterranean looking. Oof.
Oh my god. Now we have to
find an apple, and... It's a little moist. It's a little moist,
and this is not a huge town. You sure we don't
wanna take that train? 'Cause it could take
us to Andermatt, which is a bigger place. Okay. I think it makes sense. It leaves right now. So that we don't have to wait. Game time decision. We've taken the train. Okay. Yeah, this
weather definitely... tosses another variable into this. At least we're not
Adam having to potentially hide out
for hours in it. The little guys
just keep coming! Hello! Now where should I hide? I guess I could go up there just 'cause it's far away,
and that would be annoying. What about in that thing? Are you allowed to go
in that thing? Let's go check that out. Pretty sure we're
on a cog railway. Yeah.
'Cause you'll notice that... It's pretty steep. Yeah, we are rather leaned. Oh my god. Look at this. Oh my god. Look at that. Come on. Crazy. I mean, this has gotta be
one of my favorite places that we've done Jet Lag, and we've only just started. Don't slip and die. We're gonna go ahead
and not slip and die. This is going to be
key to our strategy ...is not slipping and dying. This is a fundamental
component of the game. Okay, there's fences up there. It seems like
you can get up there. Ohh. Interesting, interesting. Oh. Welcome to Andermatt. Ben, it's still raining. Okay, well... Adam could not have gotten
a lot further than here if he is in a mountain town
in this region. So... Feeling good. It is possible that he is here. But first, before we buy
any more information, we gotta get rid of this curse.
So let's go get an apple. Hopefully this
isn't hubris, but... I feel like we're on
the right track. Don't, just don't say anything. Apple. Hallelujah. Okay. That's a bad apple. Oh man, it's like... This is one of the
worst apples I've ever seen. Get a good apple. I tell you what
I like about this spot. Hard to figure out
how to get up here. And tiring to get up here. Two good things. Don't die. Do not slip and die. Eins, zwei... I don't know. I don't know German. You don't know
your German numbers? I wanna say 'trei'? Sounds right.
Yeah? I believe you. Thank you. Okay, what should I
throw at you? Something softer
than the other apple. Snowball. Let me get a sock. No, not a snowball. Rock. Okay, maybe a rock. Okay.
You ready? Good luck, Sam. Oh, I'm not
feeling good about this. Okay. Hit the apple.
Gotta manifest. Hit the apple. Oh no! Alright, it's 11:12. We got five minutes. Try again, five minutes. It says to
enter your own risk. Means I am allowed to enter. (dripping inside) Well... Not really covered. But I guess this little spot is. Neat. What are they up to? Well, the bad news is they
are getting closer to me. Quite close. Let's look to see
if we can find the building that Adam sent. It's small. If he is here,
there's a decent chance we'll see the buildings
that he took pictures of. Yes. Oh, I was more talking
about the apple, but yes. This is... a wee bit slushy. It feels like
this is small enough that we can check out
pretty much everything. Yeah, that's true. You see that building, that building is kind
of a similar style too. Not it, but... similar. Yeah, again,
it makes me think that he's in, if not here, a town very... nearby.
Right. That serves the same purpose. There's no way that
I'll get to stay here. They're gonna ask me to do
(bleep) some stupid (bleep), and I'm gonna have to go
all the way back down there. It's gonna suck. I'm just gonna get ahead of it. Let's... Let's assume this is
gonna be the hiding spot. Let's go back into town
so that we're ready to respond to, you know,
questions and stuff, but I feel good about this place. Okay, so here's something
kind of interesting. And I don't know
if they know this, but... the next train from where
they are to where I am leaves in just under
20 minutes. So, if they don't get on it, they're gonna have to
wait a whole 'nother hour to get on a train here. Which means... they need to do
this apple thing and figure out
basically where I am ...in the next 18 minutes. Okay. Oh no!
That was closer though. Oh, that was so close! Come on! Noooo-nngh! Auunngh! Alright, incredible
Team Adam news. They did not get on
the train here, which means even if they do
figure out that I'm here... they're not gonna be able to
get here for another hour. So I have a guaranteed
additional hour. I'm gonna go back to
my little cafe. Are they really... still doing it?
They can't be. 'Cause— I guess if
you were throwing a bigger object at me... Should I throw
my backpack? No. What if I threw
my entire jacket? Right, I feel like that would
be more likely to hit it. Oh, it brushed it! (grimaces) Yeah! Okay, well...
Okay, okay. What do we want to ask? That's a great question.
This apple is getting mushy. Do you want a bite?
I do not. I think we need to figure out
if he's in this little region. Yeah 'cause
I think you're right. 'Cause we'll have to
change strategy dramatically if he's not in the
near surroundings. He could have either
continued down towards Italy. He could also be all the way
on the other side. Yeah, which would be...
Which would be real bad. Yes. But I think we
have to just check. What we know is
that if he came here, he could basically
only have gotten within 10 miles of here within his two and a
half hour head start. I think let's do a
10-mile radius. It's pretty risky... but if it hits, then we're,
I mean, we know we're close. Alright. (heavy sigh) Oh. Has he responded?
We got an answer. What'd he say? He's within 10 miles of here. Oh, baby! Okay. We didn't majorly
(bleep) up at all! That's interesting.
Okay, okay, okay. If he is within 10 miles of here, he's either in here or
one of maybe two other towns. But like... we couldn't find those buildings. Oh my god. Oh, the slush is slushin'. Yes, it's very slush. So if he is this way,
he's there. That doesn't look
big enough to me. No, that's nothing. If he's this way... I mean, he could be
in ""Hospen-ental"", but that looks pretty small. I mean, we could try and ask a precision question
that is unique to here. The hotel one
could be interesting, 'cause there are definitely
very expensive hotels here. We would get an answer
on whether he's... Those hotels are
markedly cheaper... Much cheaper.
...than these. So we would know. And all of these
are in the $200s. Yeah, I'd say
let's send that. It's cheap, and... It'll give us a good sense
of where he might be. Okay, I'm sending it now. I need to move.
They asked the hotel question. And there are a few hotels here. I need to get next to... the cheap hotel. Okay, let's go. Alright. This hotel,
nightly price, $100. Ah, damn it. Ah, damn it. That was a pretty good question. So basically what happened is
in the town where they are, there are no hotels
that would round to any of the same numbers
as the hotels here. There are hotels in
another nearby town. One of which would round to the same numbers
that would round here. So... But I wasn't closest to that one,
so I had to run next to it. So now they don't know
which one I'm in, but I think they now can
narrow it down to two ...unfortunately. Well, it can't... Is it even a CBD drink? I don't know,
'cause there's no chance that you can just spell—sell THC spiked iced tea
in a vending machine. I think it might
literally just be weed flavor, which is rough. Okay.
We got an answer? Yes. $100. Oh. It's interesting. Let's look at them now. Okay, well, they
are at the train station. Which I don't love. Don't love that. Don't love that. There are basically
only two hotels that we can find in the entire
10-mile radius that we got. Yeah.
That he could be next to. There's one in Hospental,
and there's one in Airolo. The thing is, it takes
30 minutes to go there. And we'd have to transfer. It only takes 15 minutes
to go to this place. I think it would make sense
to go to this place, check it, and then
if he's not there... Yeah, I think I agree. It'd be pretty risky
to go to Airolo and then have to backtrack. That would be almost
45 minutes. Yeah. You know,
assuming the timing. Okay, we're gonna
get on the train, and we're gonna go
check Hospental. Alright, this is just
a four-minute ride. This could be it. Or we could be currently
going away from where he is. Welcome to Hospental. What?
What? What is this angle
that you're filming at? This is a crazy angle. Welcome to Hospental. We're committed now. The next train's
not for 30 minutes. If he is in this town, and we've just entered it, that means that he has
had to pick out his hiding place, which means if we ask him... (train whistle)
Oh, that's cute. ...a photo or an oddball question,
he won't be able to answer it. And that will tell us
that he is here. And he will tell us
that he cannot answer it. Okay, I think I'm into it. Requesting photo
of train station. Okay, so if he
can take the photo... he will take the photo, which
means that he is not here. And if he tells us in the endgame,
then we are in the endgame. Yep. Ugh, god. (sigh) (bleep) Well... Oh, we got an answer. (gasp) He can't! He's here, he's here.
Okay, okay. We're in the endgame, Ben. Calm down. I can't believe that we
directly went to the right town. That is unbelievable. So, okay. The one thing
that we do know... is his hiding spot is
almost certainly covered. 'Cause he would be
hypothermic if he is not covered
in his hiding spot. Yeah, Adam
gets cold really quickly. (sighs) That bridge could
be a hiding spot. That's not a bad— Should check it out? Team... What's our team name? Sem? No, ew, that sounds weird. Does not look like here. No, I think we have to ask some of the precision questions
to really figure out where— Okay, well let's be
100% sure with our math. We can ask three. Should we ask
upward photo maybe? Yeah, upward photo... 'Cause he's
gotta be under something. That's true. So I think upward photo would tell us what to
look for, that he's under. Yeah, let's ask
for the upward photo. Okay, good. This is
what I was hoping for. They requested the photo, the precision photo
facing upwards. That's why I went up here, because I think you'll
only be able to see the sky if I place it in the right spot. (chuckles) That's useless. Should we push into
the town a little more? I mean, look, I think
that there's a good chance that we could just see him. Yes.
'Cause there's nothing here. God damn. Oh, this is where
he took the photo. Is it? Maybe. Look at that. I know that looks similar,
but I don't think it was that. I don't see the other building. Oh, unless— Oh, no.
Wait, Ben, Ben, Ben. Look, this angle. Yeah, that's it. That's it. Okay. Oh, he sent the photo.
He sent the photo. Okay, let's take a looksee. Oh, this is exciting. Let's take a looksee. Oh, that's just pure sky. Well... How is— Is he— Okay. Is he giving
himself hypothermia? That might, I mean,
I guess that means that he is certainly not
near a building. Well, how is it pure sky? Now, the problem is
there's another type of photo they can request. And that one I think
might screw me, but... We'll see. Should we ask front-facing? I mean, that
would definitely help. I think it makes sense. I mean, can you think of
anything that would be more helpful? Not really. Oh. There's a little castle up there. That would be the kinda
spot that he would go. He likes castles, Sam. I think also this way
could make sense. Do we wanna get
front-facing photo? I mean, I think so, right? I think that's probably
the most useful. I was really hoping
they wouldn't request that. Yeah, that's... That's gonna give it away. Alright, he sent us... You ready? Oh, that's the castle, I think. He is...
That's a (bleep) castle. He is fully exposed. He is... Is he on top of the castle? Okay, I think it's time
to break the glass... and roll the curse dice
as an emergency. I just, I need a six. Anything other than a six
is basically useless. Well...
(dice clatters deeper) I dropped the curse dice. Yeah, they're probably
not even gonna do that. Swiss clock. Before you ask
your next question, you must clap 15 seconds after your
other team member starts a timer, within 0.5 seconds,
on each side of 15 seconds. If you fail, you must wait at least
10 minutes before re-attempting. Okay, so he asked
the Swiss— He sent us the
Swiss clock curse. But it's a question one. I don't think we need
any more questions. No.
So let's just skip that for now. Okay, I feel like
maybe this way. Put it in a map. Well, it's not
really showing the map. Yeah, it doesn't really show
a good walking route. I think we need to
suss it out visually. (whispering) I think
that they're looking for how to get here,
which is hard. It took me a while
to figure it out. I don't know
how we get to that. Yeah, I think it's
back through town. Okay. Oh god. Ooh boy.
Careful. Should we check
this out, you think? Sam, is this right? Huh? Oh, the snow is so deep. (bleep) I mean... He's wearing boots,
and I see boot footprints. Yeah. Is he in the castle? I don't know. Thought I heard something. This might be the end of the run. Well, he's not here,
but there is an inside. Oh god. Adam! Are you up there? Yeah, I (bleep) see you. This sucks. This totally sucks. Well done, Mr. Chase. Oh, this sucks. Alright.
You picked quite a spot. Well... You guys got really
close to me really fast. And it really scared me. And then you hung out
two miles away from me for about two hours,
and that was awesome. Well, on the other hand, we took the
most direct route here. Yeah, I know.
That sucks for me. Yeah.
I saw that you did that, and I was really annoyed
about it. Yeah, I mean,
mix of, honestly, I think we put some
good skill into that. Yeah.
We asked the right questions. There you go. Alright, two hours and
30 minutes starts now. Ohh! I have some bad news for you. There are two trains currently
going through the station, neither of which I think
you're gonna make. They're never gonna find me. Let's get his ass. Actually, I gotta
pick up the pace. Fun fact, this is the bridge
where Ben and I knocked apples. Where could he be?! It's all in the trees. But this might be
the end of my round. Caption+ by JS*

this season on Jet Lag. And of course, as you
might know by now, you can watch
every single episode – including episode two –
one week early on Nebula. That means you can watch
episode two right now on Nebula! And Nebula's got all
kinds of other great stuff, including original content from
a lot of your favorite creators. There's Modern Conflicts,
a great series from RealLifeLore that explores modern warfare. There's a new episode of
that out actually right now. Taboo on Screen from
Broey Deschanel, which explores how
filmmaking approaches taboo subjects like
sex and murder and even more taboo things
that I won't even mention here. The history of the B-2
by Mustard. Also, we have done
some original stuff. In addition to
various documentaries and stuff that we've made, we released a whole
episode of outtakes from the last season
of Jet Lag. That video of outtakes
is actually longer than the first episode
of that season. Plus, the whole first
pilot season of Jet Lag is exclusive on Nebula:
Crime Spree. So there's a lot of stuff there. And those are
just some of the ways that we focus on giving the
best viewing experience possible to our Nebula subscribers. We also have the Layover podcast. We release that every single week
when we're in season, diving deeper into each episode.
You know, talking about the game design, the strategy,
the behind-the-scenes moments. We argue about why
we were actually really smart when we did the thing
that kind of might be perceived as
dumb and stuff like that. We also did an episode right
before this season started, doing a super deep dive into the game design
of hide-and-seek. And before that,
we played a game that was similar but not legally
the same as Family Feud on it. It was a lot of fun. But that podcast is great, and it's available exclusively
to our Nebula subscribers. Anyway, tldr; the best
Jet Lag viewing experience is on Nebula. And it's not that much of
a commitment to sign up, especially if you go
to nebula.tv/jetlag. Because you get 40% off, which brings the cost down
under $3 a month. I think it's basically
$2.50 a month at an annual cost like that,
which, you know, is— And that's less than
a third of a latte if you're at a really
expensive latte shop. It's less than a third of a— And most people buy
a third of a latte every day. Yeah. So if you stop buying
your third of a latte every day, then you can buy—
Yeah. Assuming it's a really
expensive latte shop. Right.
But, you know, anyway, go to nebula.tv/jetlag
to sign up, and thanks in advance
for your support. Bye! Wait, where's Ben? Well, that is
the question, isn't it? No, where... Oh, he's still in Switzerland."

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","SqWs-riq6Dc","Hello and welcome to the finale of our race
from continental America's northernmost to
southernmost town. Right now, we're at
the end of day four, and it's still anybody's game. We're in Dallas,
Ben and Adam are in Chicago, and both teams have a viable
path to the finish line with the tickets
already in their hand. Ben and Adam's route is
set to get them to Key West a few hours before
Michelle and I, but we might have
a way to stop them. With only an hour left in the day, a steal just came up on The Flop. We knew this might happen, so Michelle and I had
already researched a spot to complete the challenge: the former site of the
Dallas Sportatorium. If we can stand exactly
where Elvis stood in the middle of the
former stadium, we'll earn the steal
and use it to sabotage Ben and Adam's path to victory. The only question is, can we actually get to
the spot where Elvis stood? Oh (bleep) Okay, hopefully we can get to what feels like the center. Oh my god.
Where the (bleep) are we? What's the field? Our entire strategy
is based around this ticket not getting stolen. Yeah, if they steal the
1,000 mile flight west... We are in, I would
call it massive trouble. Oh.
It's us. Thank you. Let's figure out where our train is. We still have 25 minutes. If there's a picture somewhere
of Elvis in downtown Chicago, we could maybe still
try to make it happen? Yeah. Here, let's stay close to the exit. Just in case. What does
it say on Google Maps? What are the pictures? I mean, it's right here. Oh, okay, no. It's more towards
the side of the street. Okay. Is this it? I think—
Can we do it? Okay, look at here.
Look at here. So it's the center
of that thing, right? Yes.
So it's— Look how— And it's on the corner, yes. Perfect.
So it forms— We're standing
where Elvis stood. Okay, yeah. It's right here.
This is where Elvis stood! It is marginal, but— This is where Elvis stood. Look at the geometry
form a circle around here. And then think about the center. Yes.
It is here. Let's call them. Yes, call them. I'm pretty sure that's
going to be indisputable when you look at the
satellite map, but... No way. Gentlemen? No way. You won't believe
how close it is. We have verifiable
evidence that Elvis stood just outside of this fence
in a now-destroyed venue called the Dallas Sportatorium. Wait, wait, wait. Do you have a picture?
You have an exi— Do you have a picture
of him exactly there? There's a video right there. Yeah, there's a video
of him performing here. You're standing
where the stage used to be? Yes.
Yes. How do you know exactly
where the stage used to be? We have a satellite map. (sigh) Alright. I mean, do you see any way
in which this is not legit? No, no, it's fine. Okay, well, in that case... We're doing it? Yeah. We would like to steal a card. You have two options. We have a 450 mile
unrestricted plane and a 1,000 mile flight
that has to go west. We would like to take
your 100 mile flight that goes west.
1,000. 1,000 mile flight
that goes west. We did expect as much. I apologize. Should we do a quick Flop? Flop it up, Flop it up. 11 is a 400 mile card,
smuggle goods. Okay. We gotcha. Okay, bye.
Bye. I'm sorry, Adam. I'm so— Adam, I'm sorry. Bye. Oooohhh!
Ohhhh my god! Alright. Okay, well... That throws
a wrench in the works. A very large wrench. I don't know.
I don't know, man. I mean, I think we still
get on this train, right? Let's go get on the train. Let's get on the train. Alright, I think we
need to get to the airport. I'll call an Uber.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, for Sam? Yeah.
Hey, how's it going? What's the last name? What's that? It's under Chase.
What's your last name? Chase. Chase? Ah!
Yeah. You guys are going to
Connellsville, right? Yes.
Yeah. Perfect! You guys
are actually right here. These are your new brothers. Been looking for y'all all day. I know, right?
(attendant laughs) Top of the stairs, take a left. Thank you. B. Look, Ben, it's our room. It's our room. I'm trying to figure out
what we can do. What, if anything, could be done? (sigh) Look, they're
ending the day in Dallas. They're in (bleep) Dallas. They're still a bit of a ways. I don't really know
what they're gonna do. These are truly
some big red flags. Oh my god,
this is perfect timing. Yeah.
Literally, it is 6:59 and we are pulling
into the airport hotel. Five, four, three, two... Hi, AD. Welcome to our room. Ben is standing right
now in the foyer. That's sort of a great place
to hang out and chill. We've got a nice
little closet in here in which you can put... Two jackets. Two jackets, maybe. There's the big couch here. These will become two beds. This seemingly is the light switch. No, that is something else. Yeah, so this isn't
a game show anymore. It's just sort of a travel vlog. And from a travel vlog perspective, I'm having a great time. If I were involved in a game show, I would potentially be quite
concerned at the moment. But, I'm not. Things were so good
about an hour ago. We basically had
the win all locked up. We fully were going to win. We were going to be
in Key West by 3:30. Now... Now I don't think we
will be in Key West at 3:30, to be honest with you.
No, there... It's still possible ...is all I'll say. Look, here's what I'll say. If it's Popsicle, it's possible. And I certainly believe
that it's Popsicle. This is sort of interesting. This is our bathroom/shower. It's a shower
with a toilet in it. I've never seen a
shower with a toilet in it. That's kind of a
dream scenario, actually. You can be doing two
awesome things at the same time. You can be doing two
awesome things at the same time. I'm gonna be honest,
this feels incredibly risky. Oh my gosh. This is nuts. Hello. Hello and welcome to
Ben's Shower Corner. Today, we are
showering on the train. It's very weird
because I can still feel that I'm moving on the train. That concludes Ben's Shower Corner. I'm in my cage. It's bedtime. It's bedtime.
Oh, you have a little cage so you don't fall out.
I have a little cage so I don't fall out
and die in the night. Yeah, we'll see
you in the morning. And now, the final rest period. We'll be starting day five in Dallas, and Ben and Adam should wake up
somewhere in Pennsylvania. Their train stops in Pittsburgh, but it leaves the city before
the day officially starts, so Ben and Adam will
have to get off on the train's next stop
in Connellsville and find some way to
get back to Pittsburgh, or another smaller airport, if they want to catch a flight
tomorrow morning. Without their
1,000 mile flight west, their path to victory will
be tough, but not impossible. If they manage to earn the
right tickets tomorrow, there are still plenty
of flights to Key West from cities like
Charlotte and Atlanta that get in before we can. So without further ado,
day five. Ohh, good morning. Good morning, Adam.
Hello. It would seem that
we are getting into beautiful Connellsville a little bit late. Which means we're
going to be on the train when the Flop happens. Which means— You can't do challenges
when you are on transportation. Yeah. It is just before 6 am,
and we are ...so very back. Yeah! Hey! (giggles) So we're just waiting. We are.
For a call. Hello. Hello. Hello, can you Flop, please? Yeah.
Ready. Fourteen is the first one. Okay. That's a steal.
Yep. (whispering) That's a steal! (bleep) Second one is one. Okay. That's fine. The third one is eleven. Okay. I just hear Adam's brain
going a million miles an hour. Okay, and the last one is three. Okay, got it. Bye. Bye.
Bye. Okay, go,
we've got, wait, Sam. We've got to
get to the airport. This is crazy. Okay, that was not as bad
as it could have been. Okay, there is that steal, but— That's a big one. It's completely irrelevant to us. Ugh, yeah, but we
need to slow them down. As you can tell, we are
not yet in Connellsville. We are going to be
getting into Connellsville about... 45 minutes late? Something like that. So we are still here
on the train. And we cannot do anything until... No, we can research. We can research. That's it. Um... So... Okay, but—
Let's go over our game plan. The game plan... Yeah, we didn't have time
to explain it last night. (giggles)
The game plan is basically... We're going to Birmingham. Alabama.
Alabama. We booked that flight
the second that we got here so that they couldn't steal it. So basically
last night when we landed, we used our... Random.
Random airline ticket that we got at Artie McPhee to book an American Airlines
flight for this morning. (sighs) Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that news. Yep. So this flight's been locked in,
which has been nice. Yeah, and the cool thing, yeah, you want to know how far
Birmingham Airport is from Dallas-Fort Worth Airport? 592 miles. (snickers) Out of the maximum 600. The reason why we're
going to Birmingham... Well, we'll show you
once we get there. But it makes a lot of sense.
Yes. It's a great plan, I think. And I think it's better than whatever Ben and Adam
can do from Huntington, West Virginia
or wherever they're going. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good one. You too.
You too. Ben, welcome to Connellsville. We have made
it to Connellsville. Alright, what the hell
do we do now? Well, here's the situation. We need a car to get out of here, but there is no car on The Flop. So, we just have to start
working on other stuff. Hopefully slow them down. Yeah. And hope a car shows up soon. I guess my question
would be, what do we do? I think we should start
working on memorizing everything. You think we should
memorize everywhere? Alright, let's get in the gazebo. Are we allowed
to go in that gazebo? It seems to be a
publicly accessible gazebo. So, this challenge
is a reference to ""I've Been Everywhere""
by Johnny Cash, which is actually not the
original version of the song. The original version of the song
is about places in Australia. Johnny Cash did a version with ...places in North America. Yeah, you're talking so slowly, and we need to
memorize these things. There are four stanzas with places. And so I'll take the first two, and you take the second two.
Great. I've been to Reno, Chicago,
Fargo, Minnesota, Buffalo... You absolutely
cannot do it out loud. Elevator. I've been to Boston,
Charleston, Dayton, Louisiana, Pittsburgh... Washington, Houston,
Kingston, Texarkana, Parkersburg,
Gravelburg, Colorado... Monterey, Faraday,
Santa Fe, Tallapoosa, Ellensburg... Glen Rock, Black Rock,
Little Rock, Oskaloosa... (winces) Tennessee to Tennessee,
Chicopee, Spirit Lake, Graham Lake, Devils Lake,
Crater Lake, for Pete's sake. Louisville, Nashville... Monterey, Faraday,
Santa Fe, Tallapoosa, Monterey... Hi.
Welcome. Okay.
I think I've got it. I've been to Reno, Chicago... Fargo, Minnesota... One second. Buffalo, Toronto,
Winslow, Sarasota... Wichita, Tulsa,
Ottawa, Oklahoma... Tampa, Panama,
Mattawa, La Paloma... (train horn) Bangor, Baltimore,
Salvador, Amarillo... (train horn) Tocopilla, Barranquilla,
and Padilla, I'm a killer. Okay. (train horn) Boston... (whispering) Shoot. Been to Boston... Houston.
Nope. I'm afraid the
next is Charleston. Shoot. It's time for the final... Zodiac Zone! So Sam, have I made you a
believer in astrology this week? (gasp) I am seriously
not making this up. This is what Co-Star says
about me and Sam. It says, ""You and Sam are
both searching for something."" Kinda true. ""You're looking for
a beach day."" It literally says
good for beach days. Can we talk about how
Co-Star literally said we're both good for
a beach day today? Nyeh? That's crazy! It says, Adam. ""Adam is working through
their insecurities."" Boston, Charleston,
Dayton, Louisiana, Washington, Houston,
Kingston, Texarkana. One second. Monterey, Faraday,
Santa Fe, Tallapoosa, Glen Rock, Little Rock,
Black Rock, Oskaloosa, Tennessee to Tennessee,
Chicopee... Spirit Lake, Grand Lake,
Crater Lake, Devil's Lake. Yep.
Okay. Alright, let's see if
I've still got mine in my head. Louisville, Nashville,
Knoxville, Ombabika. Yep.
Furthermore, we've got Schefferville, Jacksonville,
Waterville, and Costa Rica. We've got Pittsfield,
Springfield. We've got Bakersfield,
we've got Shreveport. How's about Hackensack,
Cadillac, Fond du Lac. And after Fond du Lac
is Davenport. Nice. Idaho, Jellico,
Argentina, Diamantina. Pasadena, Catalina.
Perfect. The next verse is Pittsburgh... Parkersburg,
Gravelbourg, Colorado. Yep. Ellensburg, Rexburg,
Vicksburg, El Dorado. Very good. Laramore. Mhm. Admore.
Yep. Haverstraw.
Yep. Chatanika.
Yes. Chaska, Nebraska. Ala—
Chaska, Nebraska... Alaska. Opelika.
Yep. Yep, yep. Then we got Baraboo. We got Waterloo,
Kalamazoo, Kansas City, Sioux City, Cedar City,
and Dodge City. Yes! Okay. Wow, that was... I don't know if that
was good content, but that was incredible
that we did it. I feel pretty good about that. Pray that a car comes up. Yeah.
Pray that a car comes up. Really need that. Alright, we'll send them a video. Okay, we're about to take off
to go to Birmingham, but we just got a video
from Ben and Adam. Hello. Hello, Sam and Michelle. We have memorized everywhere. Everywhere, we've memorized it.
We've memorized pretty much everywhere.
Oh, and we come to you from I don't even remember now.
Where are we? We are in the—
Collinsville. The lovely
Collinsville, Pennsylvania. Collinsville, Pennsylvania. Good luck! Okay, they're going for it. They're in Collinsville,
Pennsylvania. They memorized the song. They are professional memorizers
at this point, I think. Yeah, that's impressive. Where could they be going
with that everywhere card, though? I don't know. Okay, let's find out
where they're going. Alright, new card on The Flop. 800 mile flight. Become Florida Man. Recreate one of the
following two headlines, with one team member
as the Florida Man: Florida Man attacked while
taking selfie with squirrel. Florida Man found with drugs
while trapped in a Port-A-Potty. We must become Florida Man. Okay, so we desperately,
desperately, desperately need this. Yeah, okay, so we need
to find a squirrel or a Port-A-Potty, and we would need
to get drugs. Surely there
should be a squirrel. Squirrel or a Port-A-Potty. I think a squirrel would be easier. If we, Ben, if we— Slow down, slow down. We're trying to look. Okay, here's the thing, Ben. If we get this ticket, I think we have a genuine
chance of winning. I'm with you. I'm with you. And it seems like this—
There should be— Just look out for squirrels
and Port-A-Potties, please. Here, let's try going to the park. The park will be good to check
for Port-A-Potties or squirrels. I don't see any squirrels. You keep watch,
you keep watch here. I'm gonna check over there. Oh! Adam, squirrel. (whispering)
Where? Where? You do it, you do it,
'cause I can't see it. I can't see it anymore. It just went up
in that tree though. I feel like we can only
see it when it moves. We're like apex predators
in that way. Sleuthing Sam is on the case. Can it get them to... It can get them to Atlanta. Oh no. That's crazy. Could they get to Atlanta
before us though? Possibly. 'Cause then they
might go Atlanta–Miami, or Atlanta–something else. Yeah, I'm sure. Oh, that would be bad. That would be bad.
That would be very bad. Hi there, this is
gonna sound a little silly, but my friend and I are doing a scavenger hunt
across the country, and we need to take
a photo in a Port-A-Potty. Would it be possible to do that
with one of your Port-A-Potties? We will pay any amount
to rent it or anything. We just need to literally
use it for one second. I mean not even
use it, use it, but like... Okay, yeah, I called a
Port-A-Potty rental service. And they're gonna call me back. Hopefully they call us
back with good news. But first we have to get drugs. So Adam has found a pharmacy,
and we're gonna go there now. And then, hopefully... I don't know, we
could always come back and try to look for the squirrel. The squirrel just moves so fast. Good morning. And this is going to be an
extremely silly question. We're doing a scavenger hunt,
and we have to find a Port-A-Potty. You don't have any idea where
one would be in town, do you? Well, there should be
one down across the ballfield in North End. Okay. So just up here, you think? Yeah.
It's gotta be. Okay, great.
Thank you so much. Thank you so much. That's a 12 minute walk.
I think we should jog. Might as well try, right? Yeah. Yeah, Meadow Lane.
Yeah, this way. Yeah, you see Port-A-Potties? Okay. Alright, give me the drugs. Okay. I have to get trapped, so... Yeah, I'll trap you in there. Tie my hands together. Use my jacket,
tie my hands together. Okay. Okay. Okay, now, get me in here. Get in there!
I'm trying to get out. I'm trying to get—
(door clattering) I would say that he is
trapped in there with drugs. And so... We got it, we got it,
we got it, we got it. Let's call 'em.
Yes! That is huge! That is huge. (slaps rapidly) We are back in it, baby! Alright, time for The Flop. Once again, in order
to go anywhere... We need to get to Pittsburgh.
We need still need a car. And we currently have
three flights actually. That's true. (sniff, chuckles weakly) We're gonna have to drop one. Ultimately, yeah. Alright, here we go. Okay, so the next card to
come up on The Flop was this: Pop a kernel of corn
for a 400 mile train. It's not what Ben and Adam
needed to escape Connellsville, but they figured they
could knock it out easily, so they ran to a nearby pharmacy to get popcorn, a lighter,
and a hair straightener. I was curious
what this was about. Oh, it's a whole thing. It turns out, popping
a single kernel of corn wasn't as easy as it
looked on Instagram. So they went back into
the pharmacy and asked if they could
use the microwave. Is there any chance that
you have a microwave somewhere in a break room that
you could throw it into? (wheezes) Sure? Can we come in
or stay out here? Yeah, just stay out there.
(giggles) (beep, microwave hums) (kernels popping) Heyyy!
(giggles) And, after popping their corn, a car ticket finally
came up on The Flop. All they had to do was
find all the letters of one of their names in graffiti. But in Connellsville, that also
turned out to be pretty tough. Look at this. I've never seen such
a clean writing. Ugh. Not a single letter. This town is immaculate. This actually
could be an issue. Tunnel.
Tunnel? Tunnels are prime spot
for graffiti. Okay, shine a light on it. There are a lot of letters in here. Oh wait, little letters. A... D... A.
Yeah, A-D. We just need an M. It says
""Free (bleep) slowing."" ""Free (bleep) showing""? ""Free (bleep) showing.""
Oh, whoa. I hope we don't miss
the free (bleep) showing. ""My""— M, M. That's Adam. Boom, baby. That's a car, okay. ♪ Boom, baby girl ♪ Okay, now that
we have our car, we are going to do
our best to try and start heading towards Pittsburgh.
The only problem is... This town is very small. So getting an Uber here,
especially an Uber that far away... It's not going to be easy.
It's not going to be easy. What are we looking at? I don't know how they're
gonna get to Pittsburgh Airport. 'Cause best I can tell, there's
no rental car place there. So Pittsburgh Airport is
outside of their radius, so they're going to have
trouble getting there. They might
be trying to get a car. They could be, yeah. That'll take them time. Alright, we've arrived
in Birmingham, Alabama. Alabama! I'm gonna hit submit
and reserve the rental car. Yes! Yes!
Means they can't steal it. They can't steal it! This is huge. Okay. Okay, getting on the
interstate there. Yep. I-20. And we will explain everything. So right now, we are driving
directly east on Interstate 20 to the world's busiest airport: Atlanta Hartsfield–Jackson
International Airport. Where... And it's a mouthful.
At 3 pm today... there is a direct flight to Key West, Florida. ♪ Let's go! ♪ That we have
the right to get onto and they can't steal that right because Georgia, Florida's...
We stole it! Georgia, Florida—
Georgia is Florida— borders. (giggles) We are so out of commission.
They cannot prevent us from getting this flight. And that is because
we stole this ticket from them. There is a closing window of
things that can go wrong for us. (wheezes)
Sam, why are you saying— Oh my god, with your history, it is so bold of you to
say something like this. Yeah, yeah. Wait, I've got an Uber.
I got one. I've got an Uber.
You've got an Uber? Yeah.
To the airport? Yeah.
Yeah? I didn't even realize. Oh my god, yeah. Okay, well, we finally
managed to get a car. Yeah, it only took,
what, like 45 minutes? Look, I just didn't think
it was gonna even happen. No, I was getting
really scared. But, this car will take us to Pittsburgh Airport. We'll be there in about an hour. And then we will get on
a 1 pm flight to Atlanta. We could use our 450 miler
to go to Orlando, or we could hope that a really
good card shows up in The Flop because Atlanta has
direct flights to Key West. That would be the real way that we would be likeliest to win. I mean, really the only thing that can do it for them
at this point is, in our minds at least, unless there's something
that we're missing, is them burning through challenges, get the dice roll card, and then
get the two out of six chance of getting enough distance from that to the Key West flight. It's a big long shot. It's possible...
but it's a big long shot. This is us, I think. Hello. Hi. I love Pittsburgh. I never knew that
Pittsburgh was so pretty. Alright, should we learn what Ben and Adam
have been up to? Yes, we have received
a few videos from them. They've been busy. They've been
very busy doing challenges. We were on the flight. Oof, there are three. Three?! Oh no! Hey guys. I just got trapped in this
Port-A-Potty with my drugs. Oh no. Okay, so they got
an 800 mile flight to Florida. We're still in Connellsville. Connellsburg?
What was that? Connellsville, Pennsylvania. We've popped
many kernels of corn. Yes, many—
What? Okay. Still in Connellsville,
found our name in graffiti. Good bye! (giggles) Jesus Christ. Alright. Well, the only
concerning thing there is their 800 mile flight
to anywhere but Florida, but we already looked at that. And the only useful flight
out of there anytime soon was one to Atlanta, Georgia. So it would still be involved, somewhat involved for
them to get to that. Thank you so much.
Thank you so much. You have a good day. Yes, yes, thank you.
We appreciate you. Okay, welcome to
Alright, alright, alright. the Pittsburgh
International Airport. Right now it says that
there is only one ticket left on this 1 pm to Atlanta,
so you know what time it is. Time to beg. American.
It's time to... go to the ticket counter
and beg. Let's go. We're doing
the strangest thing. We're in a race across America. We're trying to get a ticket
on the 1 pm to Atlanta, but it only shows
one ticket available online. But I was wondering if
it's possible that maybe... It's sold out. Totally sold out? It tells me
that I possibly have two first class tickets. Great. We'll do that.
I'll try it. Fantastic. Let's see if it will let me do it. It's not letting me... (sighs heavily) Buc-ee's! Buc-ee's!
Buc-ee's! Michelle, we need to stop.
Do we go? Should I pull over? Yes, pull over.
This is more important. (wheezes) Seriously? Yes. No, no, no.
We're on such a— No? Okay, I'm changing lanes.
That was a test, Michelle. Oh my god. And you fail. What the hell are you—
D'what—? Oh my god. I love Buc-ee's. It is the promised land, but... (giggles)
We have more important things. And that's a rare thing
to say about Buc-ee's but, we have more
important things to do. Are you sure
we can't go, Sam? I was so excited to go. I know. Gotta get to the airport though.
Ugh. Business only. Goodbye, Alabama. ♪ Georgia ♪ Hello, Georgia. Famously home to Atlanta Hartsfield–Jackson
International Airport. And peaches! But more importantly,
the airport. Yeah. Well, let me
ask you a question. If we got booked on
the later flight, could you put us on standby
for the earlier flight? I could, but
I couldn't guarantee that that's going to happen. What do you
think the odds are? So right now
there's two people on standby. Already? And zero flights. And they would get on
ahead of you because they have status
with Delta. Okay. So our odds would be bad. Yeah, most
people show up for Atlanta. Okay. Well, we'll try it. Because I don't know
if you can be put— 'cause it leaves at 1:00. Yeah. It starts boarding at
40 minutes before departure. Yeah, we're glad to run. I'm just going
to hurry up and do it. Before it tells me I can't. Okay, I was able to get
you guys on standby for it. Thank you so much.
Thank you. This is not going to work. Nope. The people at the gate have been pretty clear that they think there's
about a zero chance that we get off of standby. We're gonna try it though. But we're certainly gonna try. Alright, we have about
five minutes left to the airport. Ooh, we're so close! Good news is, seats are
still available on the flight. Yes! Let's go! We're now basically
at the boarding time for if Ben and Adam were taking
that flight down to Atlanta. I'm still...
The silence still has me. I'm so worried. The silence could either be very bad news
or very good news. Right, right.
Nowhere in between. So Ben was turned back
at security. No idea what that's about. Okay, TSA just rejected me because they don't see the flight, so I have to go back. Hi... they said that
they didn't see the flight. What flight? That we were just booked on. I don't know.
They sent me back with this. But you have
a boarding pass. I know. 276. Sure is a lot of people. Take the 4:00 flight. Use the 4:00 flight. Great, thank you. I'm gonna go down with you! Okay, okay, thank you. I was just rejected. They said they
couldn't see my flight. Alright, let me see your ID. Did you change your flight? No.
He's on standby for one flight. He has a confirmed flight. We've arrived. Okay. Let's give it a shot. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. It's really taking its time. Oh my goodness, come on! It's good. You're good. Thank you so much. Have a good one.
Thank you. Loading... There we go. Nice.
Is it booked? Yes. We're going
to Key West, baby! Nice. We just have to hope that Adam and Ben
haven't found a way to weasel themselves onto
this Key West flight. This is so stressful. I feel like there
must be something. I know! I'm so used to
them being able to nab it out from under me. Hi, I'm on standby. I just didn't know if I needed
to check in or anything. Chase? I just got put on.
I just called you up. Uh-huh, there you go, 16B. Oh, I can get on? Yeah, in 30 minutes.
Oh, incredible. Fantastic. My friend is
on his way, Doyle. Okay! When he comes up, I'll just
have to have his seat assigned. Okay, great, thank you. Hi, at this time, I'd like to
welcome aboard Main 2. Main cabin 2. We're on the flight, Benjamin. Ohoho.
Okay, we're still in it. They thought it was
never gonna happen. The people at the gate
simply did not believe in us. Okay.
Much like the audience, the people at the gate
counted the boys out. It turns out there's no
such thing as sold out flights. You just get on. Simply get on standby.
Simply get on standby. Just leave 'em at the
bottom of this thing. Thank you. (chitters excitedly) Nearly there. We're nearly there. Just have to hope this
flight isn't delayed. Yeah. And that Ben and Adam
don't snap and get on it. And that Ben and
Adam don't sneak onto it. Gosh, I keep
checking behind me like, ""Where are they?
They're hiding somewhere."" Their flight, if they got
on that flight from Pittsburgh, they should have just landed here. Alright. Hello, welcome to Atlanta. So we have booked to Sarasota. It's almost exactly 450 miles. It's like 446 or something. And you know what?
Amidst all this chaos, I am very happy
I think that's pretty good. to have tickets on that flight. So, the better option ...would be if
we can fish for a ticket that would allow us to fly
directly to Key West. 'Cause there are flights direct
from Atlanta to Key West. And then that's it. And then that would be it. I think we can for sure
do the paper airplane thing. Paper airplane
without a doubt. I still, we still don't know
where Sam and Michelle are. Have not heard from
them all day. I mean, I have to
imagine that if we are facing all of this chaos
and all of these delays and all of these
full flights and everything... They are too.
It's probably hitting them, too. What's your stress level? My stress level is
extremely high as always. So nothing to report there. But not higher than average? It is higher than average. It always is.
Oh, okay, good, great. Especially...
It makes sense. My average is constantly
increasing this week. Okay, that, okay, got it. Yeah, that seems about right. Let's give it a go. Okay, Adam,
if you can hit that wall... Yeah, then that's a guarantee. Okay, give it a throw. It seems like
we should be okay. But they have always
pulled a fast one. Yep.
Consistently. 'Cause we think they're here. I won't believe it until
my hand is on the finish line. Yes, agreed. Easy. Easy. Alright, let's give 'em a ring. I want to know
where they are so bad, but I think they're
going to hide. They're always trying to hide. If they don't pick up, we know that they're
flying somewhere probably. This is so exciting. This is so exciting. Alright Ben,
let's update The Flop. Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben. Is it the dice roll? Two.
Two, two, two. Oh, oh. Variable distance flight. Build a giant die. The die must be at least
1 ft by 1 ft by 1 ft. You may not use a
pre-existing cube. Once the die is built,
you must randomly allocate numbers 1 through 6
to its sides and roll it. Multiply the number
you roll by 150 miles to get the distance
of your flight. Okay, update— Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup. This could be it. This could be it, baby. Let's go back this way. This could be
the whole shebang. This could be
the whole shebang. —g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g— We think... We think these. Yeah, and with three of them, 'cause they would fold open. So our plan is to
adhere them with stickers. I think that will work. Have a good one. Let's just go to, yeah,
let's just go to a gate. We will keep these records. They will not go to waste. I actually feel
like this is going to be a completely competent die. Yeah, that's actually
even better than I expected. We are on the plane, and I have
an entire row to myself. I hope these aren't
Adam and Ben seats that they got on this plane...! I mean, I'm actually
extremely proud of that. This side is four. This side is one. Five, two, three. And that makes this side six. Let's set the stakes. Yeah.
If we roll a five or a six... we can go straight to Key West. (sighs heavily) (whispering)
Did they book these seats? Literally every other seat
is filled. Except for these. Oh my god. Are you ready? I now don't know
what side it is. I'm now gonna do a whole thing. Okay, and now,
here we go. Ready? Give it, make sure it
gets a nice spin on there. (sighs) That's a three. (bleep) That... That's not what we needed. No, that is not what we needed. Welcome to Key West. We're in Key West! Here. Let's get to the southernmost point. It is beautiful here. The ocean's right there. Oh, look what we got. Oh, hell yeah! Thank you. Have you ever been to Sarasota? (scoffs) No. I don't know, maybe. Maybe you've been to Sarasota. Why would I have been
to Sarasota? I have never been to Sarasota,
for what it's worth. That's it up there. (gasps) You can see it?! Yep. I can't 'cause
I'm shorter than you. Look, it's the southernmost
bar in the continental US. I guess we didn't acknowledge that this is only the
southernmost point in the continental US.
(chitters) Go! There it is! I have visualized this moment
every day for the past month. Here, watch out.
People are taking photos. Here, just, just go
touch it really quickly. Quick touch. Great job. Let's get outta here.
We did it! We did it, Sam! Nice job. We did it! We don't want to get in
all those nice people's photos. I know, we definitely
just skipped the line of all the people waiting
to take a picture with it. Let's go over here
and FaceTime them. Okay. Hello, Michelle. Hello. Where are you? We have an update for y'all. We have something
to show you. Key West, baby! Nooo! How? How? We drove through Utah to a random high-altitude airport
and flew to Dallas from there the whole time you guys thought
we were in Colorado Springs. We took a flight
using our random card. The random card. To Birmingham, Alabama,
drove to Atlanta, then used our neighboring state
card to go Atlanta to here. Congratulations, folks. Well done. That was a game well played. Thank you. You guys were
such incredible opponents. You are certified professional
athletes by my standards. I don't know how you guys
do this all the time. It was incredible. See you in a bit.
Have fun in Key West. Bye. Bye. High-five. Sam! Sam's smiling! Show yourself smil—
No, he always— Let's find a
good spot to post up. And then hear back from them
when they get to Sarasota. Should we
get a piña colada? Potentially.
Yes! Hello! Well, Adam, we are not
going to Sarasota after all. We asked really nice,
and they let us off the plane. They did let us
get off the plane. Ready? Yep. You gotta get your
piña colada. Hello!
Alright. Sam, Michelle. But mostly Michelle. Mostly Michelle. I'm sure that it was
90% Michelle, to be honest. Congratulations on winning season 8 of
Jet Lag: The Game. A very, very
spectacular performance. Wooo! Now, I know that you
probably think that you've bested us,
that you've outsmarted us, that you have
thrown us for a loop. But in fact... nothing could be
further from the truth. To that we say, ha! We knew that this is
exactly what would happen. Which is why we stored
the season 8 trophy in this garbage can at
the Atlanta Airport. Now, you're not going
to believe this, but... Whooaa! There it goes! Woah! Woah! It floated out of the can,
and now it's flying to Key West!
Woah! Woah! Oh, do you see it?
Yeah, yeah. Do you see it, Sam?
Yeah. It's right there! Oh my gosh,
it's coming so fast! It's coming, so I have to
put my drink down. Well, it's coming
specifically to right here. Oh my god, you got it. Ready? Yay! That's great. Okay. Oh, we have to put it down. We just dropped it. Just throw it over there. Okay. Now, Michelle,
I'm sure that it was... It was a tremendous feeling. But are you feeling anything
else at this moment? Um... I guess I'm feeling... jet lagged! She said the thing!
(giggles) Yeaaah!
Woooaaaahhh! Waaaah! See you in season nine! See you in season nine! Woo! Hello! This is where I'm hiding. Good luck finding me here...! They just passed me again. It's all in the trees. This is hell.
We're living in hell. Sam, is this right? We gotta hurry
just a little bit. How did they guess here? They were this close. Getting pretty close. So close, but so far, boys. Wait, wait, I've always
wanted to do this. I've always wanted
to do the thing... Sam's been here. You know, like detectives do.
Oh, sure, okay, yeah. Okay, great. Let's find him. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus We cannot wait to bring you
Jet Lag: Switzerland. It is such a fun season. I mean, it's got mountains. It's got trains. Your two favorite things. What else do you need? You need jet laggers.
In there. And that's what happened. Yeah.
And it's a lot of fun. The game is a lot of fun. I mean, I guess it's
the first time we've been to Europe with
anything but tag. It's true. And Europe is a great
spot to do games. And so it's really fun to have
done something different there. We're furiously in
post-production right now. We can't wait to bring it to you. But, the good news is,
if you wanna see it a little bit earlier,
you can on Nebula! Because every single episode
of Jet Lag is out one week early on Nebula,
including the start to next season. And also, as a special treat
for Nebula subscribers, by popular demand, we have made a giant
compilation of clips from this season that we loved, but that did not make the
final cut of the season. So that'd be bloopers, outtakes, a ton of bits that were somehow
too dumb even for this show. The video of outtakes is
actually a full 26 minutes long, which if you're counting, makes it longer than the
first episode of this season. So hopefully it will help to
tide you through the off-season. But that video is available
exclusively on Nebula. We will not be putting
it on YouTube. It is a special thanks
to our Nebula subscribers for helping support the show. And don't forget,
we will still be doing our Nebula-exclusive
podcast, The Layover through the off-season. So there is plenty of
bonus Jet Lag content to keep you going
through the off-season, but it is only available on Nebula. And, but there's
also a lot of other great exclusive stuff on Nebula. Yeah, I mean, Nebula's
got plenty of other stuff to keep you occupied
during the off-season. You've got amazing
original content from channels like RealLifeLore, who you've seen on this show. Real Engineering, who you've
also seen on this show. You've got Broey Deschanel,
Anita Sarkeesian. You've got Lindsay Ellis. I heard there's this channel
called Wendover Productions. Sounds like it's for
freakin' nerds, actually. But that's a lot of channels. That's a lot of original,
exclusive content. And I heard somewhere
that, you know, there's the biggest ever slate of
Originals coming out right now. So there's more stuff than ever
going out on Nebula. New stuff almost
every week or so. You know, all original stuff,
and it's really good stuff because it's independent
creators doing unique stuff that you know, can't, you
can't really do on YouTube, and you can't really
do for Netflix or big broadcasters or whatever.
I don't know. If you go to nebula.tv/jetlag,
you can get 40% off which brings it down
to just like $30 a year, which breaks down to
under $3 a month-ish. Yeah?
Yeah. Exactly. Definitely. Which is not that much.
$2.50 a month actually. Especially to watch
all this exclusive content, Layover podcast, early Nebula, and help support the show. That's literally how we get
the money to do the show. But yeah, see you
in season nine!"

episode five of our race from continental America's
northernmost to southernmost town. Last episode, Michelle and I
lost our sizable lead when Adam and Ben scooped
the ticket straight to Denver that we had been planning around. That means that right now,
we're executing on our backup plan. We flew instead to Salt Lake City and set off on a five hour drive to the small town of
Montrose, Colorado. From there, we'd be able to
use our high altitude flight to make it all the way to Dallas, then connect to New Orleans with the neighboring state flight
we stole from Ben and Adam. But there's a catch. This five-hour stretch
of highway goes through one of the sparsest
regions of America. So if a steal comes up on The Flop, we almost certainly
couldn't compete for it, and Ben and Adam would be
able to steal our flight, leaving us stranded in Montrose. We're really hoping they
won't know to do that, since they seem to think
that we're already in Denver, but it's really all
going to come down to how day 4's deck gets dealt. Good morning.
Good morning. I'm hungover. It is nearly 6 am.
Here's the thing, Michelle. We don't want them to
think where we are. Right, they need to think
that we are in the city of Denver. Yes. Should I play car sounds
from my phone? That's too
complicated, I think. (scoffs) YouTube video, 10 hours,
car sounds, Denver. And just like that, it's 6 am. Welcome to the baggage claim
of Denver Airport. A place where we have
been stressed out before and are stressed out again. Let's call them. It's 6. We're running
to this Dairy Queen. So they think we're in Denver and not in the middle of
freaking nowhere, Utah. (wet mouth pops) This wall. The most
nondescript wall. Hello. Good morning. ♪ Let's Flop tonight ♪ How you feeling, Michelle?
A little hungover? A little unable to run around and do challenges, maybe? Ben, we're all
professional athletes here. I can bounce back any time. This sucks.
This sucks. Okay.
Where are they, Ben? Let me— I simply don't know. Our first card on the Flop
is number six. A non-stop to Milwaukee. Do a milk walkie. Walk 100 feet while balancing
a cup of milk on your head. Number seven,
a 1,000 mile flight west if you ride a horse.
Jesus. This flight must land
further west than it started. Number ten is a 400 mile car if you get a team mascot. Number fourteen is
an 800 mile train if you eat a cracker
in a Cracker Barrel. Alright, sounds good. Okay, bye! See you in Florida. Good luck!
Bye! Okay, this is
really good news. Because now we just go. Yeah, I think so.
To Montrose, right? The only reason
to do any of it is if we want to prevent
them from doing any. But I don't think
Milwaukee is that good. No, Milwaukee sucks. I think that we simply
must do a milk walkie. Yeah, I think that
we're going to want to do a milk walkie freaking ASAP. Alright, Ben. We need to get milk. Wait, wait, wait.
Up this way, up this way. Okay, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's really smart. Coffee place will definitely
have cups and milk. Hi, can we just get
two cups of milk? Milk?
Yeah, just milk. You want hot or cold? Cold.
Cold's fine. How do you feel about your ability to balance milk on your head? I would say
I feel better about it than I feel about your ability
to balance milk on your head. I do not have a
great sense of balance. Cut to some footage
proving that. I did it! You okay? You okay? You okay? Whoa, whoa, you okay?
Yeah. There's plenty of
footage to prove that. To be honest,
I think the risk of them getting a steal is high. Extremely high. So we just need to— Horrifically high. We knew this, we knew this
going into this. We knew that this was
a risky route. But as soon as we get
to Montrose Airport, which is at 9:31,
we drop the rental car, and then we are able
to book the flight. Okay, we're
literally not peeing for the next
three and a half hours. Are you ready for that, Sam? No. Thank you so much. Yes, sir. Let's go, let's go, let's go! We need to measure out
100 feet. Okay, here. I have to get to the United sign. Okay, this is going to
be harder than I hoped. Okay. Okay, get real slow. Oh. Ugh. Okay, alright. Try again.
Try again. We should have a couple of
hours there before the flight where we could do
challenges if we wanted to. Correct. Which would
probably be worth doing. But I think once we
get there, to be honest, I don't know if we could
reasonably do either steal. So, our potential of getting
something nabbed from us today? Very high.
High. I think we just have to hope that
they don't use the steal correctly. This is a classic milk walkie. Textbook. I'm gonna get
in front of you here. Excuse us, just doing
a milk walkie. Okay, that's it, that's 100 feet.
Let's gooo! Alright, alright, we're calling 'em. That's huge.
I mean, that's big. That's big.
That's a nice long flight. Obviously it goes north,
which is not ideal, but it's definitely worth it.
It's far. Okay, no response. Let's send them a video. Oh my god. Yep, as planned, they just did the milk walkie,
clearing a spot. Oh yeah, I wonder if
they'll go to Milwaukee then. I wonder, yeah,
I guess the question is, were they doing that to
prevent us from getting it? Or were they doing it
because they wanted it? Or were they just doing
it because it was easy? I think they were doing it because it was easy. Well, the thing about Milwaukee
is once you're in Milwaukee, it's kind of up there and all that. But it'd be pretty easy
to get from Milwaukee to kind of the east coast. And from the east coast... They can do the
1,000 mile flight west thingy? They could do that. Or they could potentially,
if they were fast, get on a sleeper train to Florida. (whispering) What? Okay, let's go
to Milwaukee, baby. How soon can we get there? There should be pretty
regular flights. One would think,
one would hope. Soonest flight... Not 'til 11 am? Really? Is that real? How is that real? Not till 11 am? Not till 11 am. That's... not great. Okay, not good news. The next flight to Milwaukee is at 11 am at the earliest
on Southwest, which means that they
are almost certainly ...doing challenges. Flop hasn't updated yet?
I'm checking. Let's update the Flop. Yep. Okay. 450 mile flight. Get knighted at an American castle. Using a sword,
which may be makeshift, both teammates must
knight each other outside of an American castle. Yes, okay. 450 mile flight. Get knighted
at an American castle. Can we do that? No, but neither can they.
Oh, you just yes'd because it's not good for them, okay.
Yeah, yes. We can do this here,
and that'd be good. Really good to get. Castle Marne, 39 minutes away. We do just have to
figure out how to get a sword. We have to figure out a sword. I mean, but it's
allowed to be makeshift. So we can just make it
out of anything. There's a park
right outside of there. I'm sure we could get sticks. Let's go to Castle Marne. I'll do it now. Hi.
Good morning. I think the
possibilities are either they're doing the
small aircraft thing, then probably not
going to Milwaukee, or they're going to wait
in Denver and do challenges, then fly to Milwaukee
and go onward. I don't think I can make
any confident conclusions, but there's little we can do to adapt to what they're
doing at this point. Right, our plan doesn't change. It's just my anxiety changes. And I would think
it would go down, but it's continually increasing so. All we gotta do now is drive. Okie dokie. Ben, welcome to... something... No, film in front of the castle. Castle Marne. ♪ Ta-da ♪ We do need a makeshift sword. I mean, there are...
many sticks about. Yeah, but we
would need a legit one. We would need a legit one. Wait, look. There's a good big stick in here. Oof, that's true. Can't really get at it. No, I can get to it. Yeah, I don't know what
the rest of my plan was. (distant quacking)
Those are the castle's ducks. I'm gonna film and
see if there are ducks. Ben, I did it. Ben, I need help.
I need help. Okay. Okay, let's shape this
into an incredible sword. Yeah, it's a scimitar. Okay. I think certainly by recess rules, this is as legit as a sword can get. Alright, are you ready,
Benjamin? Let's set it up. One hour down,
two and a half to go. You know, in the
wise words of someone... Go east, young man. I think what this season
really is all about is shout out to
Manifest Destiny, right? Shout out to colonialism. Because it's such—
Oh my god. It's such a big country,
you know? Think about how far
we were away and how far we still have to go. And if not for all our
manifest destiners ...we couldn't make
such a fun, silly, wacky YouTube travel competition
game show thing. For the record, I... I, I'm, uh, this, uh... I hereby dub thee Sir Ben, he of the sleepy—
of the sleepy head. You are now a knight ...of... ...of... Denver, Colorado. Yeah! Adam, I dub thee Sir Milk Walkie. The fastest of walking
with milk on thine head. You are now a knight too of Denver, Colorado. We've done it. Let's go ahead
and call our dear friends. If they ask where I am,
what do I say? They don't have
the right to know. Just say, like,
""Wouldn't you like to know?"" So keep it just close to your face. Hello? You're in a car
to Colorado Springs. Are you in a car to
Colorado Springs, Colorado? I'm not going
to reveal any information. Yes. Well, I'll tell
you where we are. We're at a beautiful castle
in Denver, Colorado. Check it out. Oh my god. And I don't want
to intimidate you, but we are both knights now. Yeah, that's
pretty intimidating. Honestly, I'm so happy
for you guys. That's really cool. Well, have fun in Austin. Bye, girlies. Oh, is that Austin?
No-no-no. Probably, probably Houston. Or Dallas, maybe. Bye! You'll find out soon. (giggles)
That's interesting. Oh my god, they went to
the (bleep)-ing castle? Well, that's kinda what
we thought they would do. So that makes
me think more likely that they're using
the Milwaukee card. So, time to Flop it up. ♪ Flop it up ♪
♪ Flop it up ♪ ♪ Flop it up, baby,
when you head stop ♪ ♪ Never stop, never stop ♪ 600 mile train. Get a car to honk. Write anything on a sign that inspires a passing car
to honk their horn. 600 mile train. Get a car to honk. Great, great, great, okay. They're gonna
do that quickly, though. Are they? Do they
even want the train? 'Cause how— They might try
to ride a horse next. Ooh, you know
what actually might be da move? If we get the
1,000 mile flight west. 'Cause what if we flew... Okay, this actually
might be the move, Ben. Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay, we actually have what I think is
a very good plan. And it's a cool plan. And it's cool. We're gonna fly
to Milwaukee at 11. We're gonna go ahead
and use that ticket. Actually book that in
just a second. And then we'll drive to Chicago. That'll take about two hours. On the way,
we'll eat a cracker in a Cracker Barrel,
get a train, And then we will take
a train overnight from Chicago to Pittsburgh. If we can get the
1,000 mile flight west, we could fly straight from
Pittsburgh in the morning ...to either Orlando or Tampa. I think this is a very good plan. And the good news is
we have a car called to take us to a horse place. Let me tell ya, we... This place is not open. Nope.
They open at 8. We're just gonna show up and hope that they
let us ride a horse. Look, we just gotta be
real chill. We'll be like, ""Look, you're cowboys,
we're cowboys. How's about a little
five-minute ride on the horse?"" We can be like,
""Look, we are knights. We know what we're doing."" We know what we're doing.
And it's just like, ""Look, we'll give you the amount
of money for a full lesson."" It's Sam's money, we don't care. We'll pay you truly... I would pay you
hundreds of dollars. I would pay you any amount
of Sam's money, frankly. Okay, let's go meet a horse. I really hope that
they let us ride a horse. Hi. We're in Colorado,
which is just one step closer to our desired destination
of Montrose, Colorado. And we're gaining altitude,
that's what we need. We're at about 4,800 feet. We need another
700 feet of elevation to be able to fly out. I'm so stressed. An hour and a half until we
arrive at the rental place, which effectively is
an hour and a half until we can book the flight. So we're just praying
that Ben and Adam don't get a steal
between now and then and try to steal one of our cards. And we've made it more
than halfway through the time, through the risky time
that we had to deal with. When they open at 8,
we can call them. It just stopped ringing? Yeah, that's what happened to me. This is, yeah, this is the place. I see horses. Do you see people, though? No. We need both horses and people to make this work. Thank you so much. Okay. Is there anybody at
this little booth? No. It says, ""Howdy, we are on
a trail ride, be back soon."" Alright, well that's not good. That's not ideal. Let's see if
we can find somebody. Hi, excuse me,
are you guys open? We don't.
We don't. Okay. We're doing this scavenger hunt
across the country. One of the things we have
to do is ride a horse. If we could just be on a
horse for a period of five minutes, that would be so incredible. Okay, let me call
my manager. Perfect.
We will— Thank you.
For sure, give me one moment. Thanks. Okay, this seems like a maybe? Seems like a maybe. Seems like a definite maybe. Welcome to
Grand Junction, Colorado. I am usually here every
two or three weeks because it's the nearest
city to where I live. About to pass the Chipotle,
which is my normal stop. It's the only Chipotle
for hundreds of miles. It's very exciting. There's a Chick-fil-A, but... I will not acknowledge whether
or not I go to that on camera because that would be controversial. Said the person discussing the positives of colonialism a mere hour ago.
Look... You know. I'm gonna end the clip here before you say something
you regret, Sam. Bye!
Colonialism is— —dirty. I'm literally shaking. Please, please, please, please. Please let us ride a horse. Please, somebody
let us ride a horse. Yes, hi.
Hi. The thing we're
doing is very stupid, and I'm sorry about that. We're doing a race across
America with our friends. We have to stop in different
places and do challenges. And we have to ride a horse. So if it would at all be possible for one of us to ride
a horse for five minutes, we're happy to pay whatever
the amount is we would need to. So one thing I just
realized that is very good is that the second that
we book our Montrose flight, barring any flight delays, we are for sure getting
to New Orleans tonight because they can't steal the
neighboring state card back. Because we stole it first! Awesome! You can't re-steal flights
that you stole, so... We have to get on this plane.
We have to get on this plane. This is crazy
because Ben and Adam probably have no idea
the stakes of them getting a steal
in the next 75 minutes because they clearly
don't think we're doing anything like
what we're doing now. No, they don't. This is good for us because we need to
make it through the next
one hour and 10 minutes without them stealing the... stealing our high altitude card. (yelps) Awesome.
Amazing. (whispering)
Let's go, baby! Oh, okay. Oh, sorry, okay. Bubba, my absolute guy. Nice and relaxed.
He-he-ha! (snorts) I can tell. They're just like us, Ben. They're really,
they're two good boys. Two good boys
on two good boys. Oh, we're going.
Pull back just a little bit. He got excited. Well, we won. Look at this. Woo! And then just
right back up there? Yeah.
Alright. I think that we can call this
a challenge complete. Can I call our competitors
to show them? Incredible.
Amazing. Turn the car.
What's your password? No, it doesn't matter.
They won't hear. They won't hear. Oh, there, join. Hello? Hello! Oh, they're on a horse. Oh my god! (cackles) Well done.
Ohhh! Well done. That's impressive.
So just step off? Thank you so much. Wow. I can't help but smile. I love it. We're in beautiful
Denver, Colorado, and we've ridden a horse. Congratulations to us. Bye, bye,
bye, bye, bye, bye. Congrats, we gotta go. Let's move.
Let's (bleep) move! Sam, this could be disaster. This genuinely,
if they pull, if they pull— Ah, I can't even (bleep) speak! Oh my god. Thank you all so much. Thank you so, so much.
We appreciate it. Good luck! We'll give your stable a shoutout.
We really appreciate it. We appreciate it.
Thank you. Let's goooo! Alright. We've locked it in.
Let's absolutely go! That was fun. That was awesome! That's one of the best
things we've ever done. Well, you wanna know
the other thing? It's 9 am. The thing is,
if you wake up at 5, and then you just start sprinting to do things as fast as possible, you can do a lot of stuff. You'd be amazed
what you can do. So we're 30 minutes
away from the airport? It is... And if they pull a card and somehow get it off
in the next 30 minutes? Hopefully they're— It'd be really tight if
it was the right card. Do you have your phone
pulled up for the Flop? Oh, wait, we need
to replace the Flop. ♪ Flop it up ♪

Yes! We're good. An 800 mile train? Now there's an easy one. Join the American literary canon. Okay, great. And we need a train. We do need a train. I love that the Flop is
full of trains right now. Because I don't think they're
going to be using a train, and we actually might
use a couple. And there's three trains
in the Flop right now. So that's really great. That is so good.
That is so good. I think that— I don't— I think they're not gonna
(bleep) with it anymore. I think that just secured us
our route to New Orleans. So now we are going
to fly to Milwaukee. From there, go to Chicago
and hop on our train overnight to Pittsburgh. Then in the morning, we will use our 1,000 mile
flight that goes west to fly directly from Pittsburgh all the way to probably
Orlando or Tampa. There are direct flights
to both those places. And then we are really within striking distance.
And we'll be, I mean, you know...
inches from Key West. And hopefully they don't... (bleep) with us at all and we can just
actually do all of that. I'd like to see them beat that. Look, welcome to Montrose. Welcome indeed. I kinda can't believe
we got all the way here. Enterprise! We have made it
to the promised land. Oh my god, we're here. I'm gonna pull in more.
Stop the car! Stop the car! Alright.
Clicking pay now. Come on.
(squeals) Oh. Here, Michelle. What?
We got it. We got it. We got it! We're going to Dallas! Sam! No one has ever
been this excited about going to Dallas. Oh my god. Alright, let's
head to the airport. Alright. It's, what, it's Blucifer. It's Blucifer. Whoa, did you see him?
Yeah. Whoa. I think we've explained
Blucifer on this show before. We've explained
Blucifer before on this show. It seems like
it would be a joke. But it's a, just, it's real. It's a real statue.
It's a real statue. It's terrifying. And it killed the person
who created it. That horse killed someone. Not our horses.
Our horses are good boys. Bubba was incredible. Yeah, as was Copper. Thank you very much. Okay. It's a very petite airport, but it's definitely not
the smallest airport we've been to so far this week. Oh yeah,
Utqiagvik was one room. That one was not
quite as fancy as this. I can't believe
we were at the top of Alaska Yeah.
...three days ago. Ohhhh. Okay, well, we're about to
board our flight to Milwaukee. But still no word from
Sam and Michelle. We haven't heard from
them all day. I mean, we've called
them to tell them we've completed challenges. But so far they have not
earned a single ticket. What do you think
they're up to? My guess is that they
are in Colorado Springs, and they're about to, or have
just gotten on a flight to... like Houston or Dallas. That would be
a pretty good move. Be quite good. And to them...
I say good luck. Because... our plan is... ironclad. Ironclad plan. Unless a steal comes up in which case
bad things might happen. Unless a steal comes up, in which case it could be bad. Alright, we've been
sitting here for two hours now, literally researching non-stop, in the lovely Montrose Airport. (giggles) Basically trying to
figure out our endgame. Yeah. Yeah. We've narrowed it
down to a few options. And they're all
really nerve wracking, to be honest.
I know. (giggles) But we're about
to board a flight to Dallas, and we have no idea
where we're going after this. Yep. But we have to get on
another flight today. Yes. Definitely. For sure. This is what happens when you're the last ones
to book on Southwest. Yeah, they put you real— They hate you. They want you dead. And it's truly
a battle royale in there. Yeah. Alright. Little delayed,
but we're getting on. I know, we're getting on,
and that's a good thing. Yeah. Alright, let's go. Hello, welcome to beautiful
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ♪ We're in Milwaukee ♪ Is that the Milwaukee jingle? That's my new jingle. Okay, this way, this way. So there's a train
from Milwaukee to Chicago that leaves in about 40 minutes. So we're gonna need to
earn a train ticket. There's three available. I think we can
get a car to honk if we go to baggage claim. Yeah, probably. What do you think would get
people in Milwaukee to honk? It's Wisconsin.
They like the Packers. They like Packers.
They like cheese. Honk if you love cheese. That feels offensive. We could say honk
if you hate Chicago. Don't people in Milwaukee
hate Chicago? They do have beef with Chicago. That is illegible. ""Honk ifu""? ""If U."" My sign is complete. I didn't really leave
enough room to finish mine. That guy does not
love Milwaukee. That guy did not do it. Maybe this person will. No? She hates Milwaukee. She was not interested. Adam, I think the shuttle
is parked over there. We gotta go. Hi, we're trying to go to
the Amtrak station. This go to the Amtrak station? Thank you. Alright. I didn't do a very good job. ""Honk if you hate Chicago.""
You can't really read Chicago. No, I think that reads. Thank you very much. Thank you. Here, come on. There's no cars right now. Which isn't great. Oh, there's a car. Is it coming this way?
It's coming this way. Okay, we gotta be
really eager about it. Okay. No. She was not having it.
No. She was not having it. She was not interested
in our bull-(bleep) This is not good. The train leaves in 15 minutes. We've seen one car. I think there's somebody
coming your way, Ben. Oh, they're turning into the... Oh, maybe we could
get them like this. Wait, there's a truck! No! No. No. Okay, another one coming. Honk if you love Milwaukee. Yeah, yeah, there you go. Okay, I'm gonna be
really excited. Here we go,
we got two cars coming. (honk-honk) Yeah!
Yeah! Woo! Okay, let's go! Alright, alright,
alright, alright. We gotta call them,
we gotta book the train. You call them, I'm gonna book. Okay. Oh, by the way, we're discarding our
600 mile small aircraft. Okay, they're not picking up. I'll send a video. Okay, hello, Sam and Michelle. We are in the beautiful,
albeit very wet, city of Milwaukee. And we have just
gotten a car to honk using a sign. That is the update. The Flop will be updated shortly. We have our ticket.
We're booked. Train leaves in 10 minutes. Easy as pie.
Here's a plane. Hello! Now we are off to Chicago. That lady's
gonna be on our train. All these people hate us. Undoubtedly. It's fine. Okay, new card on the Flop. 700 mile flight. Eat an alliterative sandwich. Create and eat the entirety of
a sandwich with five fillings, all of which must start
with the same letter. That's an interesting one. It's a 700 mile flight between any two cities that start
with the same letter. Perfect. I have found in simulations that it is
pretty dang hard to use. My guess is that it's
not really going to fit into either team's plan at this point, but we'll see. 3:38 to Chicago. Ben, we're finally on a train. We're going to Chicago. Okay, so just one
other thing to point out. They haven't done a
single challenge all day. It's one of those things
that seems good at first, and then it starts to get scary. Yeah. Like, what are they doing? We've arrived in Dallas. We have a plan. Just... trust us.
We do. And again,
it's extremely risky. Just trust us. Okay, here's the plan. Our plane got in too late for us to make our flight
to New Orleans tonight. But it's fine, because we're
gonna do something even better. Remember how before, we really didn't want
the steals to pop up? Well, now that we're
safely in Dallas, and now that Ben and Adam have
a concerningly powerful hand, well, now we really want
the steals to pop up. There are two steals
in today's deck, and we've identified
places in Dallas where we can do both. One involves going to
a muffler man, which Dallas has two of. And one requires you to stand
in a spot Elvis has stood. And in 1955, Elvis played
at the Dallas Sportatorium, which was later torn down and is now an open field
that we can easily access. We're gonna head to a Walmart that's equidistant from both the
Sportatorium and a muffler man to grind challenges and see if we
can force one of these steals up. We just need to make sure none pop up before
we're in position. It's crops. Yes. Yes. Yes! Finally. It's hot! Yeah. Hi, [for] Sam? Hey, how's it going? Welcome to Chicago. Now, we are making a
beeline for Grant Park. Because we were able to find a passage from
The Time Traveler's Wife that took place in Grant Park. All we have to do is go there,
read the passage, act it out, and we will have our
train to Pittsburgh. The reason that
we're running is that there's only two rooms
left on the train, and I really don't
want them to fill up. And also because,
on the off chance, if Sam and Michelle
decide to do this... it would completely
ruin our whole plan. How do we get out of here? Wow. Yeah, I will say it is
very windy right now. So that's fun. Where you going?
Heading to Grant Park. Thank you! Alright, what do I do, Ben?
Welcome to Grant Park. Okay here's what's gonna happen. I am going to read this passage
from The Time Traveler's Wife in my best audiobook voice. And you just act it out.
You're the time traveler, okay? Okay.
Okay, okay. Are you ready? It's cold. It's very, very cold. And I am here, lying
on the ground in snow. Oh, okay, wait, wait, wait. Where am I? I try to sit up. My feet are numb. I can't feel my feet. I'm in a very open space
with no buildings or trees. How long have I been here? It's night. I hear traffic. I get to my hands and knees. I look up. I'm in Grant Park. And here we are in Grand Park! Woo! And that's earned us
a nice, juicy train. Okay, okay, I'm gonna— Let's go ahead and
call Sam and Michelle. Call, and then
we need to book ASAP. Hello? Hey.
Hello. Hello? I think they're in an Uber. We are in beautiful Grant Park
in Chicago, Illinois, and we have just joined the
literary American canon. Cool.
Congratulations. Good luck doing whatever
it is that you're doing. The Flop will
update in just a moment. Okay.
Look forward to it. Bye.
Bye. Bye-bye now.
Bye! (bleep) Oh my god. Alright. Unless a steal comes up,
we're golden. Alright. Famous last words. Yep. 300 mile car. Send an anonymous threat. Using a device that is not yours, from an anonymous email address, email the other team a threat. Please. Oh, good. A pedestrian 300 mile car. Just nothing...
We're safe for now. Where... are they? Where are they and
what the hell are they doing? What have they been doing? Why haven't they done
a single challenge? I feel like—
It's freaking me out. Look, you know what? It doesn't matter. Because we are about
to book our train to Pittsburgh.
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. So, the funny thing is we
actually can't go to Pittsburgh because it would
get in too early for us to get off of the train. So what we actually have to do is book to, like, Connellsville.
Connellsville. Then, unfortunately, we are gonna have to
drive back to Pittsburgh, and that will take an hour. But look, I know
that the audience is absolutely achin' for a
shot of Connellsville. Two rooms left, baby. Woo! Let's absolutely goooo! Brap, brap, brap,
brap, brap, brap, brap. And I have booked our train. Well let's mosey on back
to Chicago Union Station. I am hungry, and
that train doesn't leave for an hour and forty minutes, and I think we should
get dinner in Chicago. Let's get some dinner
on the way. Alright, so, our two locations,
if we have to blaze it, are Sportatarium and
Ray's Muffler. Yup. Have a good day,
and good luck! Thank you.
Thank you so much. Excuse me, where are
the stuffed animals? Stuffed animals? (indistinct)
Okay, thank you. Here at Lou Malnati's. We may have just won the game. A miracle has happened. We discovered a new route,
which is: 10:30 am, Pittsburgh to Charlotte. Using our 450 mile
unrestricted flight. Then 1:20 pm,
Charlotte to Key West. Key West is 736 miles and it is west of Charlotte. That's a pretty good time. That gets us into
Key West at like 3:30. 3:36. That's crazy. Feels like a winning route. That's gonna be hard to beat. Unless they can steal our cards. Does this work?
Maybe the smallest one. Oh.
Yeah. We have our mascot. Let's check out. I'm getting ready to FaceTime them. What's our mascot's name? Why do you always
stand in front of walls? You have to tell us where you are. We're in Dallas, Texas,
and this is our new mascot. His name is Ben III. Wow. And that is an iconic
looking mascot right there. Flop-date? Okay. Uh-oh.
What? Ohhh. (bleep) Steal. Steal Elvis' spot. Stand anywhere that Elvis stood. You must be able to prove
that Elvis stood there. That's great. That's great. Go, call the Uber.
Call the Uber now. Okay. Are we anywhere near somewhere that Elvis was? Let's look. Okay, so it's
Dallas Sportatarium, right? Dallas Sportatarium. How do you spell that? S-P-O-R-T— It's just him... On stages.
On stages. It's all stages. Can we get on the stage
at Chicago Stadium? No. Okay, we also need to leave. I need a fast driver,
and I need a clear road. Why don't I have service here?! I can't load anything. Let me try restarting my phone. Okay, great. Come on, come on. Has he ever been to Den— to Chicago Union Station? Wait, wait, is that Elvis? Is that Elvis? Is that Elvis in Union Station? No, that's him in Penn Station. (bleep) Why does everything
take so long today?! So much waiting and
waiting and waiting. Okay, what's it looking like now? It's still coming.
Three minutes. Okay, the car is
just about to arrive. I'm watching a video from 1957 of crowds waiting
for Elvis in Chicago. But it's not clear if he's
going to walk outside. How many minutes?
How many minutes? How many minutes? Sam! Still three. Sam.
Now it says one minute. That's her. Sick. Hi! Thank you.
For Sam? Yes, for Sam. Look, we don't need this steal. No, we don't need this steal.
We don't need it at all. We need them to not get it. The Flop will reset
in the morning. So if they can't get it in
the next hour, then it's gone. It has to be the exact spot. Yeah. Our entire strategy
is based around this ticket not getting stolen. Yeah, if they steal the
1,000 mile flight west... We are in, I would call it
massive trouble. That is... what I feared. Oh (bleep) Oh my god,
where the (bleep) are we? The finale is up right now

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","Bvd1ozFzYu4","Hello and welcome to
episode four of our race from continental America's
northernmost city to its southernmost city. Right now, both teams
are making their way through the American West. Michelle and I are ahead, having made it all the
way to Boise, Idaho with a solid hand of tickets
and plenty of options out. Ben and Adam,
on the other hand, are still stuck back in Seattle. They're 20 minutes from
boarding a flight to Idaho Falls, but that plan might be
about to go out the window. Another Flop? Another Flop. While they were
sitting at the airport, this ticket hit The Flop: A non-stop flight
all the way to Denver. Whichever team secures this ticket will lock in a guaranteed lead. So it's all going to come down to who can run a drunk mile
the fastest. (gasps) Bye!
Bye! (bleep bleep) Okay, okay, okay.
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. Okay, I think we gotta— We have to try it. We have to! Ugh. I think we're
gonna miss our flight. How fast can you run a mile? I don't know, six minutes? Go, go, go, go, go. I'll follow you. I can do it in the airport.
I can do it in the airport. Find alcohol,
find alcohol, find alcohol. Okay. Oh my god, I'm insane. There's bars and stuff. Yeah, yeah, there's a wine bar. Hey there, can I get four
shots of gin, please? Can't you give me four shots? I'm twenty... six. Whoa, hang on,
hang on, hang on. We gotta get your ID. Yes, of course. What's the
most you can give me? Okay, great. So this is two, this is two.
So I'll do half. We appreciate it. Of course. Alright, good luck, Adam! I can explain what we're doing. You rolling?
I'm good to do it. You wanna do it? Yeah, I'll do it. Okay, you're
sure you wanna do it? I'm ready to go, if you need... No, I got it.
Okay... Go. I'm going! You know, it was probably
not the most awesome move ever ...to eat so much
macaroni and cheese ...right before this. Pretty intense flavor. Take that second
half of this one. Here she comes. How you doing?
How you holding up? Alright.
I'm good. Keep it going, keep it going. He's got to run a mile. Think of the Mile High City. Well done. (bleep) this. Uggh! (belch) She did that split
in like 1:45. So that's a six-minute mile
that she's running. That's crazy. My tummy is just ...macaroni and cheese
and gin. The perfect running fuel. There she is. This is— Uh-oh! Don't break your ankle!
Oh god dammit! Now a little more? (spits) There we go. (lolls tongue retchingly) How is this compared to
running in the Death Valley? (spit) So much worse! Insane. Go for it. (bleep) (retching belches) Ough. Ough. Okay. Don't throw up in the airport. Excuse me. Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben. Here, I'm coming to you. Do you want this? Okay. There we go.
There we go. Let's go. (screams) I'm gonna be honest,
my tummy feels so bad. I need to really, for sure... not throw up in the airport. (laughs) No, I'm good. Well, after that, yeah. Okay, oh. He's coming back.
He's coming back. Let's go! Come to meet me, maybe! Come here! Come to you?
Closer! I'm calling them. Getting prepared. (retches) Okay, come on. (retches) You nearly got it. You ready for it? Hello? Challenge completed. Guys, I've got
some really bad news. We already did it. You did not pick up the phone. We tried to call,
you didn't answer. Okay. That's a mile. That's a mile. Call, call, call. Call, call, call.
Call, call? Okay, okay,
we're making the call. There's no response.
That's us. That's us, Ben. (sigh) That's us. What? (giggles) Where are you? We're in beautiful
Seattle–Tacoma Airport. Turns out you can run in airports. Who knew? Okay, bye. Good bye. I'm very sorry, Michelle. That sucks. That's brutal. Ugh, okay. (sobs) I'm sorry.
I'm actually gonna cry. Okay, I'm pretty
drunk right now. Yeah, yeah. It's hitting me a little bit too. Okay, it's a—
(cackles) Michelle just
sent us a picture and says, ""I'm (bleep) crying."" Yeah, well, when you
go up against the boys, you are bound to (bleep) cry.
When you go up against the boys, you get absolutely (bleep)-ed. So I would say we're
squarely winning now. Yep. And everything's going pretty much perfect,
I would say. (bleep)-ing how? They were
right next to a bar. Let's regroup. Let's figure out the game plan. Okay, so we have... That's so disappointing.
I'm actually— I'm (bleep)-ing... We do now have the
450 mile from the pumpkin. Right? We could go to Salt Lake City. Yay! Wait, there's a flight
to Seattle in 50 minutes. You wanna go to Seattle?! Sorry, to Salt Lake City. Can we make that? Would we wanna make that? (coughs)
Should we take that? If we can book it? I think we should, right? Are you gonna give me
any useful intel? My intel is... It's Scorpio season.
Adam's a Scorpio. And that's what got him
through the mile. How did they seem so
coherent when we called? I think it was Ben or
something, I don't know. (half-spoken to distant music)
♪ Elbow somebody to lean on ♪ Swallow your pride. If I have faith. You need to borrow. I'm feeling so awesome. I need to book it now, so... Just do it.
I think so. I mean, we can probably make that. The only thing is,
it's in 50 minutes. If we miss that... our flight is gone. Then let's gooo! Yeah, so can you... Can you help me get
this stuff together? Ohohoho my god! I'm so mad at Ben and Adam. Ben and Adam editing this. I'm mad at you! Come on! Oh, by the way,
I've booked our flight, which means that ticket
is out of our hand. We now have a free slot
in our hand. There's an overnight
train to Denver at like 7. But we don't have any train tickets. Worst case scenario,
we don't get a train. But we still make it
to Denver tonight, and they don't get that card which is still phenomenal. The flight that popped
up in The Flop is... ...pretty good.
What is it? The 600 mile flight
to/from an obscure airport. Oh yeah, that is pretty good.
That is a pretty good one. You have to go
to an obscure museum. We can't do that right now. No. (jazz beatboxing)
But it's gonna be good for them. What are you doing? Yeah, I need a laptop
and shoes off. Very bad news. I put her date of birth in wrong.
We have to go to the desk, but we have so little time
until our flight closes. Yes. Yeah it has. Here we are. You earned it, buddy. I'm gonna be honest,
I feel like... The last time that I had
to get drunk on camera, I really... kind of held it together. Yeah.
And this time, I feel like... I'll let loose, baby. Yeah, it's time for Drunk Adam. Adam, do a jig. Thank you. Okay, it's definitely right now. Boarding closes in five minutes. We'll be great. You're doing great. B-20. Looks like it might be fine. You ready, are you okay to run? Luck, luck. Look, look. I know that everybody
wanted Ben to get drunk. But that's not how it went, okay? That's not how it went. I got drunk instead. And that is... is okay. I'm gonna call Maeve. What are you doing? Maeve's here! Oh my god, Maeve's here? Shout out to Maeve. I'm... I'm recording
on the camera. You are... the most beautiful
woman in the world. Almost there. This is... going down to the wire. Wait, where are we on? Hey. Here you go, guys.
Thank you. Thanks you too. We made it. Time to take a nap in this. Hey.
Hi, how are you? I miss yooouuu! (smooches profusely) I'm gonna normal up for the flight. We're gonna put
a bag over his head. Bye, Maeve. I'm calling my mom. Welcome aboard, and
thank you for choosing Delta. The health and safety of
our customers and crew is our number one priority, and the shared responsibility
of everyone on board. Yes, we are.
We're in it to win it. Yes, indeed. Love you, mama! How long is this flight? Shut up. Nobody knows. Can you send me my ticket? I'm giving you a lot of tasks here. Alright, off to Denver. Didn't think we'd be
going there today, but... Let's goooo! This plane does seem
like it's taking off late, which is unfortunate. It is unfortunate,
but you know what? We're still...
more ahead of schedule than we thought we'd be. We're in Salt Lake City! Okay, so here's the deal. Yes, here's the deal.
Here's the route that I think I've identified. I think I've found
a route that can get us all the way to New Orleans by the end of tomorrow. Assuming no steals. That would be the only thing
that makes it break down. We need to get this steal. So, by the way,
we just mentioned steals. That's a new kind of ticket
in today's deck that allows you to steal
a ticket from the other team. They're pretty rare, but a steal coming up
at the wrong time could throw a wrench
in anyone's plans. We have to get this steal. First one that's
open today, I think. That's an easy one. But...
I... What the wrap entails... Do you want me to film you? No, it's fine.
Okay. So we're going to Petco
right now. I just realized something. No, what did you realize, Sam? Is this good or bad? Let's go back to the gate. Here, here, here. Was it in the overhead? Yes. Oh no.
I wasn't thinking about it. What happens
if we don't get it? Okay, well this flight
was supposed to leave at 1:06. It's now 1:30 and we have not even
moved from the gate, so... We might be losing some
time getting into Denver. We were hoping to get
a train out of Denver tonight. And now it's looking more and more like that might not be possible. We'll see. Alright—
Weird question. Is that the pumpkin
Is that your pumpkin? Is that what you left?
that they brought out? Yes. Those aren't ours, no. That's someone else.
Okay, there's that. I know it's crazy, thank you. Oh, they took it off. Oh my god, I was panicked, okay. That was so lucky,
dude, oh my god. Okay, so let me
go back to explain. We go to Petco. We explain some birds,
the birds and the bees. We get the right to a
400 mile rental car. Slay. We use that rental car
to drive overnight – you know, stopping
overnight, obviously – to Montrose, Colorado. Are we going
to go Colorado to Dallas? Yes. Yes!
From there, we can get one really long flight tomorrow, kind of around noon to Dallas. And we'll have a
perfectly timed connection to get to, I think, New Orleans. New Orleans.
Yeah, the risk is if they steal one of these cards... I am going... I am gonna—
'Cause we're gonna be— I'm gonna freaking call
Ben's mom because she follows me on Twitter. If Ben and Adam try to
steal one of our cars, I am calling their
parents personally. You hear this guys when
you're editing this? Do you need a snack? Always. Well you have— But we need to
get in this Uber first. I'll get a snack at Petco. They have snacks. Not for humans. For Sam?
For Sam, yeah, hi. We've been sitting
on the runway for an hour. And they just did an
announcement to tell us that they forgot to put
all the bags on the plane. So they have to do that
before we take off. So... It's fine. We're at Petco. Yay. Let's find birds. Alright, this is awesome. Wanna get this parrot or
whatever ready for adulthood? So... As your legal parent,
I have to explain to you that you didn't come
from a stork, even though that's another bird. You actually came from... I don't know how birds
have sex. How do birds have sex? I'm not sure. Well, humans, let me tell ya. There's a thing called
a 'penito'. I'm saying that because (bleep) will probably
get blurred. Bleeped. Bleeped... in Jet Lag. 'Cause Jet Lag's PG. And it goes into a vahuna. And then... (bleep) And it fertilizes the egg and then you have a zygote. And that's pretty much
what happens. So... It's crazy out here. You have to have
two bodies fully connect to make a baby. And it's... It's kinda nasty. Yeah. Well, good news. That was 20 seconds. Good bye, my guy. Bye, and I'm sorry. But that's where you came from. Alright, great job. Well, that was easy. Let's call Ben and Adam. And I'm gonna tell 'em
how I really feel. Which is not good. Hello. We got the birds and the bees. Michelle's doing awesome. And... She just did an awesome trick. That was an awesome
trick that she did. Adam, I'm mad at you! Wait, wait, I didn't
hear anything you said. I heard it, I got you. Oh, oh, and I forgot
to mention. We're in Salt Lake City! Salt Lake City. Okay. Bye! Okay. Alright, you ready for a Flop? Flop me, baby! Flop it! Steal Jimmy Johns' crown. Order Jimmy Johns to a location. Before the Jimmy Johns arrives, you must make a sandwich and have one team member
deliver it to the Jimmy Johns. It's the steal. Let's go! Wait, Michelle,
Michelle, Michelle. Concentrate, concentrate. Okay, we need to find a
good Jimmy Johns nearby. Well (bleep) It is the game's
very first steal. Which is a problem because ...hopefully this flight
is about to take off, but we're going to be
in the air. We're not going to
be able to get it. They're for sure gonna
be able to get that. And then they'll be able
to steal one of our cards, or they'll just hang on to it and steal an even better
card down the line. But either way,
that is not great for us. There's no way
they can get to a Jimmy Johns because they're on a plane! But no, their plane just landed. Landed?! Seemingly. Either that or
they're boarding. Either way, we gotta hurry. Okay, here's the thing.
We need to— I'm going to book that rental car because we need to open up
a slot for the Jimmy Johns. Book it, baby. You want me to research Jimmy Johns? I can do that drunk. One second, I'm doing it.
Nope, nope, I got it. Oh, there's one. There's one right here.
There's one right here. Let's go! Okay.
Come on. Let's find a grocery store. I'm coming for you, Adam. You see me? I'm coming for you, baby! I'm coming for you! For clarity, apparently
our staffing here handles other airlines besides Frontier. They're a contractor. They handle Air Canada,
us, the other airlines... (bleep) We have to win this. I know, we really do. There's a Costco.
It's a five minute walk. There's the Jimmy Johns. Okay. Let's just get there. I'm downloading the
Jimmy Johns app. Okay. The only problem with Costco is that the food is
all the way at the back. You've got this. Wait until I'm ready to go. Okay, I got my Costco card. Okay, I'm going. Go! As I was saying,
the whole moral of this is: Just don't have alcohol. Just don't do it. Don't try it. Just... be good kids. I know a lot of
you guys watch–(hic) are high schoolers. Stay in school. Get into Yale like Adam did. Just kidding. We like Adam. But Adam's a Scorpio and Adam is
(bleep)-ing this up for me. Can we talk about how
I literally predicted Scorpio season
was gonna be crazy? Adam's a Scorpio,
he doesn't even realize it until he's literally editing this. (whispering)
I'm normal, I'm normal. But I send well wishes to the boys. I wonder if they're
getting off or on a flight. Please be getting on a flight. Please. Please be stuck on
a plane right now. Please. We have been on the runway for about an hour and a half now. Hopefully Michelle's
just so drunk that they can't really
get anything done. That's kind of what we're
banking on at this point, is that... she's just fully incapacitated. I wanna go to bed. But I won't because I'm a fierce, fierce
Jet Lag competitor. Come on, Sam. Alright, come on, Sam. Please. Hi.
Hi. Thank you.
Thank you. Go, go, go, go, go! I know, but I need to make it. Okay. Oh my god, rip that thing apart. I've got cheese and meat. That's the sandwich. I'm gonna go. Go, go,
go, go, go, go, go. You have directions? Wait, which way was it? This way.
To the right, yeah. And then left! Left out of the parking lot, Sam! Go! Ooh, bread. Now I can have
the leftover bread. They just started
loading the bags on. They are getting
those bags on board. And once it's all accomplished, I'll get back to you
with another update on our arrival time
there in Denver. Thanks. Thank you for your patience. Got it. I see the Jimmy Johns car. Frickin... ...got it. As far as I know,
Michelle didn't call me. Alright, back over there,
I guess. You know, I look like a maniac running across the parking lot
with a sandwich in hand, but that's what Jet Lag does to ya! Hello, Sam. Hello! Hi, Michelle. We've officially beaten
Jimmy Johns at their own game. How does this work? When you use it, then
we will tell you our hand. Okay, well, see ya. Miss you guys! Good bye. Ladies and gentlemen, please make sure
you take your seats. Make sure you check your
boarding passes one more time. I know we all
are going to Denver. Yo, Sam, we are
back in the game. Here's what's interesting.
What? I thought that they
were getting off of a flight. We know they're on the ground 'cause they're not
allowed to pick up a call when they're in the air. I thought that they
were getting off. They're getting on! We are so still in this game. Oh, we got a Flop. We got a Flop. 400 mile car. Bribe the chief of police. Visit any local police station
and leave a dollar outside with a note outlining your demands. 400 mile car.
Bribe the chief of police. Okay. Anyway, we should get
to our rental car. Are we still doing that plan? Yeah, we locked in.
We booked. I mean, we have it.
Alright. I mean, theoretically, we could steal and
fly out of here, but I just don't
have a plan for that. No.
Let me, let me— We need to save it. For the last day? Probably. That's crazy. We could probably steal
and go to Colorado. But we're already
going there right now. Yes, but much slower. What car did they use? They just used one, and that means
they have two other ones that almost guarantee would
get us to Colorado, to Denver. Let me check if there's a
Denver flight that we could make. I just feel weird
using the steal so early. I know, I know. The main cabin door
has been closed. All passengers need to be seated
with their seatbelt fastened and all carry on items,
including laptops, must be stowed. All cell phones and
other portable devices need to be for airplane mode. Flight [indistinct]
preparing for departure. There is a flight
we could make to Denver. Right now?
At 5:30. So we would actually
have time to make it. This is insane. What is your gut telling you, Sam? I think yes.
I like the plan that we had, but this gets us to where we
wanted to end today anyway. Because then
we're even with them. Pretty much, yeah. Because they're
about to take off. And we would have
one more flight card than them. And there's nothing left
they could take from us? Not really, no. Do it, Sam. Live free, die trying. I don't know what that means. What could you
have possibly done? We would like—
We would like to steal a car. Okay. We have a... an 800 mile flight
to a neighboring state and a 600 mile flight
on a small aircraft. Okay, we'll take
neighboring state. Yeah, yeah. Good bye. Miss you! ...evacuate through a window bank then while on the aircraft,
wait for a water evacuation. They are located in marked
overhead bins in the mid-cabin. For everyone's safety and comfort, federal regulations require
all customers to comply with posted flags and lighted signs
throughout the cabin, Well... as well as crew member instructions. That's not good. That's awesome. Let me go ahead and
book that, right? Yeah, book it! I am so glad we're doing this
instead of a rental car. This is perfect. We have burned
all the challenges. We're locked in.
Wait. All we gotta do is get to Denver. Wait. What do you mean wait? Sam, do you need my computer? No. No?
Oh my god. Oh my god, what?! The flight is sold out. Google Flights sold it
as available. Why did we do this? There's a Southwest
flight going to Denver, but it lands at 7:05.
I know. There's a bajillion flights that are just a
couple minutes too late. What's annoying is there's... there's a flight directly
to Colorado Springs. It's probably where
we want to go next, but it arrives past our rest period. (bleep) (grumbles) Aaah, I'm so mad! We're gonna figure this out, Sam. Stick with me. What else is neighboring to Utah? Arizona, but there's
no good flight to Phoenix. I mean, those are really
the only two states that would be useful for us. (bleep)
Maybe Albuquerque, no. Oh my god, (bleep) Okay, so the decision is, do we take that
rental car to Montrose, but then kind of in
the middle of nowhere for The Flop tomorrow? Or do we stay here, see if we can beg
our way onto that flight, but then probably just
waste the next three hours? If everything goes to plan, I think the route to Montrose
might be marginally better. But, I'm really worried
about steals and putting ourselves in
the middle of nowhere. Yep. Exactly. Okay, if we're trying to get
on that Denver flight by standby, we gotta go now. Let's come. Just route us to the airport.
Let's go. Yeah, I think I agree. Still sold out. (bleep) (growls) Hey, for Sam, hi. Has this been one of
the most dramatic days of my life? Which airline? Delta please.
Delta. Alright. We're here at the airport. It's going in and out
from showing available, so let's get to a desk. Hey.
How are you guys doing? Good. We were trying to
book last minute seats on the flight to Denver at 5:30. It was showing two seats,
and it was not, and it was showing it again. Is there any way you can help
to see if we can get on that? Or is there a standby
option or something? Yes.
Yeah, mhm. What do you
think the likelihood is if we were to wait here and see if someone doesn't check in? Low? Okay, no worries. Thanks for checking.
Alright, thank you. Well, that answers that. I guess we go to the rental car? I guess so. The rental car
option is still decent. So I wouldn't— Let's get on the road then. We still got the pumpkin. So how long
is this total drive? Five hours?
Five and a half hours. We should be able to
make a little bit today. We'll see. Let's get rockin'. Honestly, I like being behind. This is where I'm comfortable. This is— Sam, that's
why you haven't won as many seasons of Jet Lag! This is—
What's going on?! This is my home in Jet Lag. Sometimes it doesn't work out. Most of the time,
it doesn't work out. Jesus (bleep) Christ. Sometimes it might work out. ♪ Adam Chase ♪ Welcome to Denver, Colorado. Yeah. I thought I was going to
be feeling a lot better when we landed in Denver
than I am. I did too. Well, I actually
slept the whole flight. And when you wake up in the
middle of playing Jet Lag, it's very jarring. It's like someone's
pointing a gun at you. But in a fun way. We were supposed to have
about two and a half hours. And we could have
probably forced up a train and gotten it and gotten on the
overnight train from Denver. We would have gotten
off in Creston, Iowa. That would have been cool. It would have been very cool. I really want to take
an overnight train. But we don't even have time to
get to the train station now, even if we did have a card. No, we only have
about a half an hour. Let's just go position ourselves
outside of security then. Where are we? Oh, we're already halfway there. Yeah, we're going to a spot where we have a great card for it. The only risk is if they
steal it, of course. So we gotta be super careful – when and if they call us – that they don't know where we are. The plan is more or less
out of our hands now. We have accepted that there is a good degree of risk
that we are taking on, but we think it's the best plan in the circumstances we are in. Adam and Ben
are intelligent pickles. They might think that we have
gotten a flight to Denver. That's true,
because they'll notice the lack of noise basically. Yeah. And they'll notice that there was a Denver flight
on the schedule. They won't know that
we couldn't have gotten on it. So that's pretty good,
because they're gonna be— That's actually a
really good point, yeah. They're gonna be... They're not gonna be thinking
that we're doing this, I think. (sigh)
I wonder where they are. My guess is here. 'Cause here's what I think. I think that they are really
gonna want to be using their... high altitude flight. Out of Colorado Springs.
Out of Colorado Springs. Yeah. So my guess is that they... are probably here or
on their way there. I think I've been to the circus 'cause this feels like I'm
a (bleep) clown right now. This is my drive home. This is the route that I take home
from Salt Lake City or anytime I come this way.
Crazy. So I've driven through
this canyon a bajillion times. Oh, beautiful. That's how they
make wind, you know. That's how they make wind. I think what we
should feel good about is that they got
a massive W today. And still, it's
pretty neck and neck. Maybe not geographically,
but at least kind of like, effectively with the
cards that we have. So that, you know... We should feel decent
about that, I think. Okay. We have looked at quite
a number of flights. It is unclear what we
should do, I would say. The one flight card
that we have doesn't seem to have a ton
of great uses from here. Nah, I mean we could
go to Tulsa at like 10. But then from Tulsa,
we might get a little sticky. Yeah, I think— It's gonna depend on
what tickets pop up tomorrow. We just have to see
The Flop tomorrow morning. But yeah, it is 7 pm, so... We will see you here
at 6 am Mountain Time. Okay.
It is 7 pm. It is 7 pm and we are ending our day here in the middle of nowhere, Utah. This is amazing timing
because it's exactly 7 pm, and this is exactly the hotel
we wanted to stay at. So we don't have to drive
anywhere tomorrow morning. Yay!
Small behind the scenes. Perfect! And we still got the pumpkin! Ben Jr. Ben Jr. Good night. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus As you can probably tell,
that was... one of the more... chaotic days of... just my life. Certainly my time on Jet Lag. But there was a lot
to handle between helping Michelle and
carrying a pumpkin. and strategizing at potentially
the most crucial moment in the game so far and filming. So I apologize
for what might not be the best cinematography
you've ever seen. I think it was the best
cinematography I've ever seen. Thank you.
I appreciate your support. But for kind of an additional
layer of analysis on ...that whole chaos,
plus our decision at the end, we talked all about it on our Nebula-exclusive
podcast, The Layover. And The Layover, of course, is just one of many, many
reasons to sign up for Nebula because it is, of course,
its own cool streaming service with amazing series from
people like RealLifeLore, who you may remember
from earlier seasons. You've got documentaries from us. We did a whole documentary
in Alaska, of all places. It's actually the
first project that we three worked together and
collaborated on. So you can get more
us in Alaska content. Very different types of stuff.
Very different kind of content. Good.
Yeah, we're not on camera. But you can sometimes hear us
behind camera asking questions. Yeah.
Kinda fun. Yeah. And, I mean,
right now on Nebula – I watch Nebula all the time – right now I'm watching Taboo on Screen
by Broey Deschanel. It kind of gets into the sort of
taboo subjects of filmmaking. And I've been watching
the first two episodes, which are about the...
for any of you who are as sort of terminally online as me, and you've been, sort of,
plugged into the Zoomer debate of whether we should just
stop having sex scenes in movies at all, 'cause
Gen Z is really puritanical. I'm Gen Z, but it's
kind of weird, anyway. This show breaks it down. It's really interesting. And that's just one
of the many things you can watch on Nebula. And look, if you're
going to sign up for Nebula, you know, you gotta
do it with our link. Why? 'Cause you get 40% off an
annual subscription when you use nebula.tv/jetlag and also when you use that— I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, which is the way that Nebula
figures out that we sent you, so that they can give us
money to fund the show is it's the people
that use our link. If you just go to Nebula
without the link, they don't know that
it's because of us, and we don't get
anything from that. And then we can't
pay for all the airplanes. And then, that's bad. We can't pay for
the many airplanes we own. We're in a lot of debt. So anyway, you know,
go to nebula.tv/jetlag, get that 40% off, watch the next episode now,
listen to The Layover, watch Taboo on Screen,
do all the things. There's so much more
on Nebula, and all you have to do
is click the button here, or link in the description. See you there!"

to episode three of our race across America. Right now, we're six hours
into our second day, and we've just started to
make our way out of Alaska. Michelle and I are
currently in the air, on a flight from Anchorage
all the way to Seattle, Washington. We already earned a 400 mile car
and a 450 mile flight in Alaska, giving us plenty of options
out of Seattle when we land. Ben and Adam, however,
only just landed in Anchorage on their delayed flight
from Utqiagvik. To make matters worse,
the last flight of the day from Anchorage to any other state
– that is, this flight to Seattle – leaves in just 34 minutes. And it's too close to departure
to buy a ticket online. That means that Ben and Adam
have no choice but to go to the gate and beg the airline
to sell them a ticket. Otherwise, they'll be
stuck in Alaska for the rest of the day. Hi.
Hi. Is there any chance
it's still possible to book a ticket on this flight? Yes, ma'am. Yeah, it's—
What I'm doing is so stupid, but I'm in a race
against another team. I can't take the 4:00,
I have to take this one, or else I'm stuck here all day. If there's any way that you
could help us out. Of course, yes ma'am. She said she has to finish
checking in the flight, and then she'll see. So, we'll see. Okay. Now that we have some time, I think it's time for... the Zodiac Zone. ♫ (gong, slow harp) Because we can't leave
things up to chance. We leave them up to the stars. It says that Sam and I can
comfort each other in times of anxiety. And then, let's see Adam. Oh, I can't pull up Adam's. That's all we have for today. We'll see what tomorrow holds. Zodiac Zone. ♫ (gong, slow harp) It's under 30 minutes now. So I think the system
might not even allow it. No ma'am. Yes, ma'am. The 4:00 flight's
the only one that comes up. There's no possible way to get us on this one? No one you could call, or... Sure, yeah. If you can put it on
standby for this one, if that would let us get on. That would be great. Yes, of course. Okay. We can get on? We can get on this? Thank you so, so much. We can, we can, we can. Thank you so, so much. I'm sorry, I know what
we're doing is really dumb, but we really appreciate it. Thank you so much.
Thank you so much. (cackles) (whispering)
We're going to Seattle! We're going to Seattle! (giggles exhaustedly) I really can't
believe that that worked. Thank you so much to Julie, who did not seem amused
by our bull-(bleep), but ultimately saved our ass. And now, we're both
going to be in Seattle. So... We'll see you in Seattle. Let's goooo! Hello.
Hello. Welcome to Seattle. We're here. It's raining. I'm terrified. Good news, we're in Seattle. And Ben and Adam are not. Bad news, we expected them
to miss their connection. Yeah, 'cause their
first flight was delayed. And I don't know how
they would have made that because we checked
a bajillion times. You cannot book a Delta flight
within 45 minutes, and they landed within
45 minutes of it. And I guess the reason
why we think that happened is because we have
heard nothing from them. And they should have had
plenty of time to do challenges and all the incentive
to do challenges. Right. So I don't know how
they would have done that. This is what I'm telling you. It is Scorpio season,
and Adam is a Scorpio. This is the kind of stuff
that happens... I don't know if the
Delta reservation system... (scoffs)
listens to Scorpio season. The good news is, though, that leaves us with some
pretty good challenges to do in the next two hours. I mean, I think the one we want
is really that random card. Yeah, it's not on the board yet, so we've gotta
complete everything else until it is, pretty much. Okay, so just so we're
clear, this is our plan: Each day, there's a different deck that new tickets are drawn from. And Michelle, being Michelle, has memorized every single
ticket in every day's deck. On our flight to Seattle,
we realized that there's only one more powerful
ticket in today's deck: the 600 mile flight
on a random airline, and we'd be able to
earn it pretty easily because one of the spots on the Random Places
map is in Seattle. So, we're going to
try to burn through easy challenges on The Flop until that ticket comes up, allowing us to grab it while
Ben and Adam are in the air. First up: Face cookie. Put a cookie on your forehead and get it in your mouth
without using your hands. Okay, cookies secured. Ah, a casual $13. Jesus Christ. Alright, let's find a
relatively inconspicuous spot. Okay, do you want
a vanilla sprinkle or a chocolate chip? Well, let's try
different tactics and see if one works
better than the other. Nope. I think you gotta be gentle. Ohh! Oh my god, there's people walking. I'm on my eye. The nose is what's tough. (laughs) I'm on my eye. Okay, I'm blinking it down. I'm blinking it down. Okay, watch out. You're leaning a lot,
so you gotta be careful here. Not too much. That's pretty good. No, a little bit this way. Yeah, a little bit this way. Yeah. Oh, that's pretty good,
that's pretty good. The tongue trick. No, more out, more out. More that way.
(giggles) Ooh, ooh, ooh. That's pretty good,
that's pretty good. Oh my god.
That's— Ooh, ooh, ooh. Oh my god, I just
touched it with my tongue. Yeah, towards here. A little bit more,
a little bit more, I think. This way.
Ooh, there we go. Let's go!
There we go. Okay, let's call them. See if they pick up, I guess. They did not pick up.
It's just a procedural step. We don't expect them to
pick up, but this does... It confirms
they're on the plane. Which I really don't
understand how they did that. Okay.
Let's do The Flop. Big money, big money,
big money, big money, big— Oh, there we go!
(squeals) 600 mile flight
on a random airline. Go somewhere #random. Go anywhere on our
list of #random places. Spend at least 15 minutes
being #random there. Once completed,
randomly generate a number between 1 and 7 to determine which airline you
can fly on with this ticket. Let's gooo! Alright, so off to Archie McPhee.
We get to go straight there. Yeah.
Come on, Sam. Slay. This was the right tactic. Let's go! Yes. Thank you.
Yes. Okay, we have arrived
at Archie McPhee. So, all we have to do is visit, but I figure we should
at least buy a thing. Yeah. We should find
something to buy. We could do
a silly random montage. Maybe.
In advance. Montages can be
expensive, though. Why? A lot of editing time. Oh. You gotta sync it
up to the music. I think Ben and Adam
are down for a montage, right? Right, right, right? Montage starts.
Well, I mean... Okay, this will be Adam.
Then we need a Ben. This kind of gives Ben vibes. So with all the talk
of horoscopes this week, I think it's time to
get a scientific answer on how this week
is going to go. So let's find out. ""Now seems like a good
time to reevaluate who you choose to
spend your time with""? This does not bode well.
Michelle... I think we've been doing
excellently as a partner...ship. Right? What? Alright. Solid day. Yeah, good day. We made some ground. Ben and Adam had
some Ls, some Ws, but... Major Ws for
Ben and Adam, obviously. I really don't understand how that happened.
I don't get it! It looks just like Seattle. Feel that? It's like tropical. Relative to our previous situation. Welcome! ...to Seattle. Are you ready? Yeah. You took such a long pause. Let's take a look... at what has happened. Okay, two videos. Here's the first one. Hello!
Hello, gentlemen. We have no idea how
you made that flight, but... congrats. (both laugh) Oh, face cookie. Okay, that's fine.
So they got a car from that. Hi, Ben and Adam! That looks like... We come to you
from Artie— Artie Mc—Yeah, okay. Archie McPhee's. Okay.
So that's the random airline. Yeah, where we just had
15 random minutes. Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean... The interesting thing
about that flight is it could end up being
very, very useful for them, but it could also end up being... Gonna be useless, yeah.
not that useful at all. The other thing we need to do is we need to figure out
which airline we get. Oh my god! This is the craziest part of it. Oh my god. How do we do that?
Yeah, so... You need a random number, one through seven. One.
One? What's one? American, that's pretty good. It's a big airline. Nicely done. Chaaa! Let's go! Yeah.
Sam! One of the big three.
That's what we want. Here's what I really
think the situation is. I think the real situation is: we need to be in a good spot
ready for— to do challenges the moment that The Flop
happens tomorrow morning. Okay, do you know
where we're going? No. Alright, what now? I think now it's time to strategically position
ourselves for tomorrow. It's just turned 7:00. Yep, it's 7 pm,
we are at the ride share pickup
at Seattle–Tacoma. I think it's gonna
get bloody tomorrow. Day three... the tickets become
much more powerful. If this is the
end of an episode, maybe it's the middle
of an episode. If it's the end of an episode, I'm saying next episode's
gonna be really exciting. If it's the middle of an episode,
I'm gonna say, you know, the next part of this episode
is gonna be pretty exciting. I think both of those,
great points. Good night!
Good night! Good news. It is 7 pm, and our day is done, which means we can get food. That's the most exciting part.
Yay! Good night!
See you tomorrow! Now we're heading into Day 3, and teams are neck and neck, but that could change quickly. The Day 3 deck contains some of the game's
most powerful tickets, like this one that lets you
steal an opponent's ticket, or the non-stop flight to Denver that teams can earn by
running a drunk mile. That ticket is why we positioned
ourselves outside this Safeway, in case we need to get liquor
first thing in the morning. Securing one of these tickets
could mean the difference between pulling way ahead
or falling far behind. So now, let's fast forward
to tomorrow morning and see what tickets are available. Hello.
Good morning. Good morning. Alright, let's do a Flop. Okay.
Alright. Our first card is... A 600 mile flight
to a city starting with G, U, Y, F, I, E, or R. If you visit a diner,
drive-in, or dive. Our second card:
A 300 mile car for wearing too much denim. An 800 mile train if you
write a word on Strava. An 800 mile flight to
a neighboring state if you are a great neighbor. There's your Flop
for this morning. Okay, bye! We miss you, Michelle! Bye! See you later. Gosh dang it! Okay, we've got Guy Fieri. That's a terrible Flop. Yeah. Okay, so obviously... We're gonna wanna
do the neighbor one. We need to do
the neighbor one. Yup.
Freaking ASAP. So, Guy Fieri, I don't
think we can do at this hour. Do you want me to check? Maybe quickly, but... And then the great neighbor. That, the Goodwills
aren't gonna be open for a few hours.
Correct. Is the Goodwill open? My guess is no. And the answer is, in fact, no. That's a great point. Those are all extremely
hard things to do at 6 am. But that's
probably good for us, because it's a bad Flop. So we can make progress while they're stuck here
dealing with a bad Flop. How about you check Guy Fieri, I'll check the first
flight to Boise? Are there any
Guy Fieri locations? No, these are all closed. What about Slim's Last Chance
Chili ""Shake"" and Watering Hole. Chili ""Shake"", Watering Hole. Voula's Offshore Cafe. It's open. It's open. Voula's Offshore Cafe is open. Oh, should we go? It seems to be
actually quite far. The problem is, if they're
going for that one too, I think they're closer. But is that worth it? 'Cause that's a pretty
conditional card. Oh. What are any cities that
start with 'Guy Fieri'? Yakima. Eugene, Reno. Could fly to Reno. Does Seattle even
have flights to Reno? I bet it does. Okay, I think that actually
is the better move. Okay, so there's
a 7:35 to Boise, so we would have to go. I don't think we have
time to research. We basically need to decide now if we're gonna take that flight. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm getting us an Uber
to Voula's Offshore Cafe, and I just have to hope that
they're not also headed there. (growls internally) Right?
(winces, lolls tongue) We just need to decide. Do it. Let's do it. Airport? Is that what your gut's
telling you to do? I think so. Lock it in? Lock it in.
Great. Hey, for Sam? Yeah.
How's it goin'? Yep.
Yeah. How are you doing, guys? Good, how are you?
Doing great. Thank you, have a good one. The good news is, if anything
really quick comes up, we might be able to do it in here. So we should, you know,
have a finger on the trigger. Wait, I shouldn't say
that in an airport. Well, Ben, I'll go ahead
and tell ya, I don't see them. Okay, that's a good sign. Good morning.
Good morning. Hi. Hello, and welcome
to Voula's Offshore Cafe, where Guy Fieri went in an incredible episode of
Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. The menu has a section of the
things that Guy Fieri ate, actually. So this is super convenient. Which one do we want? All of these are
gonna make us feel awful. Yeah. So I was looking at things. Basically there are
three good places we could fly with this card: Reno, Nevada; Idaho Falls, Iowa;
and Great Falls, Montana. Probably the first two. Probably the first two. Basically, right now,
two leading theories. Leading theory one: we fly to Idaho Falls,
starting with 'I' ...and then drive three hours
to Salt Lake City then figure it out from there. It's not a bad move. I mean, frankly, if we— Even if we ended the day
in Salt Lake City, I'd be pretty happy.
That wouldn't be that bad. Option two: we fly to Reno, and we get on a train overnight
that could shoot us out in Green River, Utah,
so Eastern Utah. Which is a little
bit the middle of nowhere, and that kind of scares us. Does scare me, I'll tell ya. Tell ya that it scares me. But we're just gonna see. First things first,
let's eat this pancake. (whispering)
Top secret talk time. We have made it
to Seattle Airport. ♪ We have! ♪ It was very quick
and efficient, actually. No word from them yet. I have to imagine,
based on that... they're probably trying
to do the Guy Fieri one? I think so. This diner has been
featured on one show. But now it's about to be featured on a second, even better show. I'm Ben Doyle, and this... Is the Snack Zone, baby!
Is the Snack Zone. Today on the Snack Zone,
we're eating a Chinese pancake. Ow. What this is, is it's a pancake
with ham in it. I think our deal is, we're going to Boise. We'll get there basically
at 9 am Seattle time, which is when a lot
of things open anyway. It'll be 10 am there. Perfect.
So more things will be open. Yeah, Goodwills
and stuff will be open then. Yeah, so we should
look into locations. Girl, I got some Goodwills
in Boise, let me tell you. 'Cause I did my spreadsheet! Ayy! How do you feel with
the whiplash of learning that you're going to Boise
with an hour's notice? I love it.
I love every second of this. I'm having the time of my life. It's crazy. It's like if I eat any faster,
I'll throw up. Don't do that. I will get through this pancake. You know what,
for this last little bite, let's get a little syrup on here. Adam, what's your review? That was a pancake
with ham in it, for sure. I feel like I ate
the pancake so fast that I didn't even really taste it or know what it tasted like. But, I'm sure it's great. Anyway, let's call them. Hello. Hello, we are at a delicious,
wonderful breakfast cafe where we have just eaten
what Guy Fieri ate. In Seattle, right? Oh yes, and we're in
beautiful Seattle, Washington. Okay, bye. Good bye! Okay, well, let's see what's
next on The Flop, shall we? Okay. Okay, I'm waiting
to see what The Flop is. Oh my god, if the
drunk mile comes up before we board this flight... Yeah, we need to decide
in 10 seconds. Our flight is boarding, but depending on what
comes up in The Flop, we may not get on this plane. The next card on The Flop is... 400 mile car. Explain the birds and the bees
to a bird or a bee. The explanation must be
at least 20 seconds. You must be within
at least 3 feet of the bird or bee while explaining. It's a 300 mile car. Pretty useless. We can't do that. And it's a car. Great.
So, let's go board. That's good.
That's good for us. And honestly, that could not
probably be a better Flop. 'Cause we don't want— In our situation.
We don't want cars. They can't do the
other one super easily, at least the good stuff. Alright, so now
let's take a look. So this is interesting. There are two cars, a train,
and the neighboring state flight, which is a good flight. It's a good flight. I mean, can we just
triple-check that there's no... There's nothing like a
Goodwill or anything? There very well might be. Oh, there's a Goodwill
that opens at 8. Ooh, where? The Seattle Outlet Goodwill. And that's back
towards the airport anyway. Back towards
the airport anyway. 12 minute drive. Easy, okay. We're gonna go to the Goodwill. I think we'll have to wait for
a little bit for it to open, but then we can speed through and do this challenge,
hopefully real quick. Thank you. Bye, thank you! Hi. I'm not sure what
people other than us in this situation line up
early for the Goodwill, but... Okie dokie, we've
made it to the Goodwill. But they told us that we
could not film in there or bring our backpacks in there. We've sent Adam in to go rustle around for
red sweaters and ties. We chose me to stay
with the backpacks because obviously I am the
strongest and most powerful. Therefore, I can defend the
backpacks better than Adam. Okay, we clearly
stumbled into a world we were not aware existed. No? It was insane in there. It was insane in there? You were like,
everybody got stationed. And there was a countdown until when you were
allowed to get stuff. And then everybody just
started going nuts. Grabbing things and
putting them in their cart. I don't know what
they were looking for. This, these two sweaters
and ties, was $2.64. That's awesome.
Okay, let's put them on. You take the big side,
put it over the little side, and then loop it. No, you've— Nope. I (bleep)-ed it up. Take the big side— I'm just gonna do it. Okay. Oh, these are very petite. Yeah, that one could be mine. This is for a dog. Yeah, yeah. As long as it's on me. Are you ready
to be a good neighbor? I feel like the
spitting image of Mr. Rogers. Fred Rogers himself? Yes. Fortunately, Adam,
I have great news. There's a lot of trash around here. Great. Well, this
will be really easy. We have to pick up 10 pieces. And we actually should hurry, because if they are
competing for this, I don't want them to get it. We've decided to
spread disinformation. (giggles) It's all about psychological
warfare, right? It is. I think this is gonna be a tactic
moving forward, yes. Yep. Here we go. Or, should I give context? Nah, it's fine. Trash. Alright. Now that's one piece
of trash right there. Oh, there's a cup here. Yep. Two. Seven. This is a bag of dog poop, I think. I don't know what this is. Ten. Look, here we did it. We've done it. Now we have
to find a trash can. We do have to find a trash can. We should have
started with that. That's compost. Here's garbage. We've done it! Well, now we have to— We have to donate
these now, though. Oh, right. To a different Goodwill. Okay. Hi. Thank you! I think we can just put them— Put them in here, okay. Put them right in. Okay, well... We've done it.
Alright, let's call them. We have received a video. We just landed. Let's see what happened. Ohh, what's up?
Hello, Sam and Michelle! What?
I don't— I don't know. We've just been
really good neighbors. Oh no. And claimed an 800 mile
flight to a neighboring state. Anyway, enjoy flying to
wherever stupid place you're flying. Okay, let's look at The Flop. Alright, time for
The Flop, Ben. New ticket, new ticket. 600 mile flight
on a small aircraft. Make a giant roadside
object look small. Visit one of America's
giant roadside objects, according to our map. Take a photo that uses
forced perspective to make it look little. 600 mile flight
on a small aircraft. Now that is a
pretty, pretty good one. I mean the challenge is a little— Well actually no,
I think that there is a giant roadside object in Seattle. The world's largest
cowboy hat and boots. I mean... come on.
I mean... The real question is,
we've got a couple— We've got a full hand right now. And so if we want to
earn any more tickets, we've got to use one. Right. So now is kind of the time
to decide where we're going. Here's their plan. Ben and Adam are going to
use their Guy Fieri ticket to take the 12 pm flight
to Idaho Falls, and drive from there
to Jackson, Wyoming, where they can take a
flight in the morning using their neighboring state ticket to get all the way to Denver. Michelle and I, meanwhile, don't have many great
options out of Boise. So after we landed, we started burning through
tickets on The Flop to get something good to pop up. We started by attempting to
write a legible four-letter word by running around on Strava, but I had a bit of
trouble writing roll. Pony. No.
Ugh! Anyway, on their way
to the airport, Ben and Adam decided to stop at the Giant Hat n' Boots
to quickly snag the flight on a small aircraft. Adam, Adam. I will play cowboy music,
you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, get closer so
you can be a cowboy. No, you're too small to
be a cowboy right now. I know, I have to
be way closer to you. Do a cowboy expression. Is this what cowboys would do? I think so. Say what you're hungry for. Beans. Yeah, yeah!
No, that's working. It looks like
I'm wearing the boots? Yeah. Yee-haw! You're swirling me with force. Well, like a cowboy. That got this ticket to pop up, which would be good in states
like California or Texas, but neither team wanted it. Okay.
Okay. I don't think
that's the best card. No, no, no, no, no. So let's see if we can
complete this right now. We are no longer going
to be going through California, because we're going
to go through Idaho. And I don't want to go all
the way south to Texas. Okay, stick to the plan. That meant we had to keep
trying for a better ticket. So we went out into the city
to try the Strava challenge again, and Michelle set out to
write the word 'acid'. Done. Hopefully Sam gets that
that spells 'acid'. I'm ready. Okay, is it looking good? It's good. Oh, that looks pretty clear. Is it acid? It's acid! Yes! Nice job. Challenge complete, graphic. Let's give the boys a call. What do you want? Hello. We have just spelled
the word 'acid' on Strava in Boise, Idaho. Let's learn the new Flop. 1,000 mile flight to or from
an airport above 5,500 feet. Live like you were dyin'. Go skydiving,
rocky mountain climbing, or spend 2.7 seconds on a bull. Indoor skydiving and
mechanical bulls qualify. Rocky mountain
climbing is defined as laterally climbing
20 consecutive feet while at least two feet
off the ground on a natural feature anywhere
in the Rocky Mountains. Okay, new card on The Flop. It's a high-altitude flight.
Okay, now this one is interesting. I would really like to get it
to stop them from getting it. Should we go do that?
This is really good. Go, call the Uber!
Okay. This is so exciting!
Oh my god. Okay, so should I
go to that climbing area? I think so, right?
Yeah. Rocky Mountain climbing. Here we go! Blackquist Rock Climbing. (grumbles) We're not in
the Rocky Mountains. Is Idaho Falls in
the Rocky Mountains? I think a lot of Idaho has
Rocky Mountains. This is great. I mean, a 17-minute drive
to a rock climbing spot. And we're in the
Rocky Mountain region. Oh my god.
This is perfect! Hey, for Sam. Yeah.
Hey, how's it going? Where is the nearest
indoor skydiving place? There is an indoor
skydiving place in Seattle. Oh, we're really close to it. We're really close to it, Ben. Have a good one.
Thank you. Okay. We've got to be
really quick because there's a chance they're trying
to do this challenge too. Seriously? Well, yeah.
I mean, that's a good one. The only one they
can do is the indoor skydiving. It's not open.
Yeah, but you can do— Oh, it's not open? No, it opens at noon. No, it doesn't open until noon. I looked. I looked for mechanical bulls.
I don't know. Hey, what about
Bourbon Jacks Honkytonk Grill? Does it have a bull? Oh, yeah. Oh yeah, oh yeah. Bourbon Jacks Honkytonk Grill
has a bull. Hi, sorry, we're gonna change the place that we're
going, if that's okay? This is awesome! Yeah. I mean, it's crazy
that this is just... It was a 15-minute drive
from a random Albertsons. Oh god! Yeah. Right here. How is this
not climbing already? Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no. It says the mechanical bull
might be gone. Oh. Hey there, do you guys
still have that mechanical bull? Oh, okay. So there's no way to ride it? Okay, great, thank you. No?
That's a no from Bourbon Jacks Honkytonk Bar—
Honkytonk Grill. And they call themselves
a Honkytonk Bar and Grill. Let me keep looking, though. This is precarious. Yeah? It's not great this way. Yeah, this
looks pretty tough. Yeah. We're in the worst gear. Yeah. We don't
have shoes or anything. It's looking a little
bit better over here. Mechanical bull,
mechanical bull. Just don't look too
far from the airport, because it's going to make it No, I know, I know, I know.
...harder to pull off. I know, I know. Ah, it's okay.
It's okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. We're doing a stupid thing. Yeah.
This looks better, yeah. Yeah, this is looking better. Okay. If we sort of just... went across this, across and up. Ooh! The (bleep)?! Do you want me
to give that a shot? Yeah.
Okay. Let's see it, Colorado man. Alright, is this two feet up? Oh, far, far beyond. Okay, I'm going to
start going laterally. It's very slippery. I think if we could get it,
we should. But seemingly we can't. I'm just worried also that the... if the non-stop to Denver shows up while we're in the air. It could. Certainly could. It's a real risk. Okay.
Alright. Welcome back to Seattle–Tacoma. I think we should get through and go to where there's
duty-free alcohol. That's pretty good. Sam started here,
and is all the way here. I think that's 20 feet! Let me just go
over there to be sure. Sam, I think you
have lived like you are dying. Let me live like
I'm dying slightly more. Oh, okay, got it. Okay. Is that good? That is beyond. Let's inform Ben and Adam. Woo! Let's go! Ooh, they're calling us. Tell me they didn't go
Rocky Mountain climbing. Sounds like you
know where we are. Did you— Did you go
Rocky Mountain climbing in the Rocky Mountains? We did! Yes, yes, of course you did.
This sucks. Of course you did. You ready for a Flop? Yeah. Flop it up. Okay.
Flop it up. 400 mile car. Fund the military
industrial complex. Spend money in any way
that you can prove funds the United States
military industrial complex. This money cannot be spent online. Alright, well... Good bye.
Bye! Disaster averted for now. They, again... They can burn through
challenges all they want, but they're still in Boise. I imagine they have some
very specific flight they want to be taking. But they've been
there for a long time. Hopefully they're just not
able to accomplish much while we're in the air. Let's look while we're at it about the military
industrial complex. Here's the thing.
The list that we got of stuff that is
military industrial complex is massive. Raytheon, we could get
an air defense system. Uh-huh. John Deere is one. There has to be
a John Deere. Probably.
A Home Depot. Hey, for Sam. Pro tip, the
best airport restaurant that I have yet found is the Beecher's Cheese Shop that is in the
Seattle–Tacoma Airport. I discovered them
because I started buying their very expensive frozen
mac and cheese at Whole Foods, and then it turns out it's also
a real place at this airport. I have to take my
incredible Lactaid pill. Mmm, the delicious taste
of Lactaid. Okay, we're at Home Depot. Oh, engine oil,
that's what it was. John Deere Drift Guard
engine oil. We're gonna buy this,
and then we're gonna FaceTime them. And if they don't respond,
they're probably on a plane. (gasp)
Hello. Ugh, stop calling us! We're just over here
trying to enjoy our mac and cheese
We are tired of your bull-(bleep). at the airport,
and you keep calling us. What do you want? We have funded the
military industrial complex. I guarantee you
there were easier ways that you could have done that, but we're not going to
tell you what they were. New Flop. Big Flop date. 450 mile flight. Become a pumpkin parent. Acquire a full-sized, live pumpkin at least 12 inches in width
at some point. You must travel with the
pumpkin for the next 6 hours. If you are not in possession
of the pumpkin after 6 hours, your opponents may steal
any card from your hand. 450 flight, pumpkin parent. Okay, good bye. (giggles) Well, okay, that's not
exactly what we need, but we can get it really quickly. We can, but we have
to carry it for six hours. That's fine, that's fine,
that's fine. I already see pumpkins. That one looks healthy. And it's not too tall,
which is nice. It only has to be 12
in one direction. Perfect, grab it. Grab it? There we go. How do you feel
about our new child, Sam? I love it. They're going to be so mad. We're getting a call. (heavy sigh) What do we do if
the Denver one shows up? Do we just leave the airport? I don't know. (laughs) She's beautiful. Thank you. You want to know
what her name is? Ben. Okay, that's creepy
that you did that. Well, look at your outfit. That's true. I am looking very pumpkin-esque. Yeah. Another Flop? Another Flop. Non-stop flight to Denver. Do a mile drunk, not high. Run a mile.
For each quarter mile, you must drink one-quarter
of the amount of alcohol that would get a player
legally drunk. Uh-oh. (gasps) Bye!
Bye! Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, (bleep bleep) Okay, okay, okay.
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Okay, I think we gotta... We have to try it. We have to! Ugh, I think we're
gonna miss our flight. This is the ticket
everybody wants. This is it. I can go to the airport. Find alcohol,
find alcohol, find alcohol. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus One of the teams is
going to make it to Denver. Who knows who? Except for all the people
on Nebula, of course, because they've already
watched episode four. It's out right now on Nebula, just like every single episode is out
one week early on Nebula. So it's worth going
and watching over there. But there's also a lot of
other reasons to watch Nebula. One thing you might
want to check out on Nebula after you've gone and watched
the next episode, of course, is: Lindsay Ellis did this great
original piece on Guy Fieri, the ups and downs of
Guy Fieri's notoriety. Obviously, we got a little reference
to Guy Fieri in this episode. And if you want to learn more
about Guy Fieri's career, that is perhaps one of
the most comprehensive versions of it
that I've ever seen. And Lindsay Ellis also only
posts stuff on Nebula now. So, if you want to
see any of her stuff, you gotta go to Nebula. I never knew I wanted to
know this much about Guy Fieri. I did, I always knew. No, you did? Okay, well...
Yeah. And there's actually a lot of
stuff you can only see on Nebula. And there's more
and more by the day. Nebula is actually releasing its biggest ever slate of Originals. More Originals than they've ever
put out at this pace before. And it's really great stuff. These are big budget,
unique projects from independent creators. Part of what Nebula
does is, you know, we have all these YouTube creators who make really, really great stuff
on super low budgets. So if you give them a bigger budget, then they make incredible things. We can pop up some of the things
that are happening on Nebula now. All of the different Originals
that are coming out. They're very exciting,
from all kinds of creators. Creators, a lot of them, you probably already watch
their stuff on YouTube. You could watch their
passion projects on Nebula. They're really good. And, I don't want to
get ahead of ourselves. It's not going to
come out for a while. But we are working on a
really big Nebula Original. Big and secret.
That's all we can say about it, is that it's big and secret. It's, for sure, is a secret. It might be good. Could be.
We'll see. That's a secret. Either way, it's probably,
you probably want to see it either if it's good or a disaster. But, you know, TLDR, there's bajillion
reasons to be on Nebula. Bajillion.
Bajillions. And, you know,
even if, you know, the Jet Lag stuff alone
isn't convincing enough, there's so much good, unique
stuff coming out all the time. And, you know what? If you use our link,
little secret for you, nebula.tv/jetlag,
you'll get 40% off, which brings that down
to how much? Well, Sam, it's $30 a year,
which is about $2.50 a month. But what about...
Daily... I mean, you would be looking at 10 cents a day. That's crazy. Less than half a cent an hour! What? I have so many half cents. Where? In his pockets! Oh. You won't show us?
No. Okay. Anyway, go to
nebula.tv/jetlag to sign up, and thanks in advance
for your support. Bye!"

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","NFPQW7gQ6Ho","Welcome to episode two of our race from the top of Alaska to the bottom of Florida. In this game, teams must complete
challenges to earn tickets which they can use to
purchase transportation. Last episode,
my partner Michelle and I managed to earn a ticket onto
today's one and only flight out of America's northernmost city,
Utqiagvik, Alaska, giving us the lead on
Ben and Adam, who are now stuck in
Utqiagvik with no way out until the next flight
at 10:30 am tomorrow. Well, that is bad. But all is not
lost for Ben and Adam. With Michelle and I in the air, they now have
two and a half hours where we can't compete
with them for tickets. This is especially bad for us,
because today's best ticket, a 1,500 mile flight that could
be a team's way to the lower 48, is still hiding somewhere
in the day's deck. So with the time left
in the game day, Ben and Adam are hoping to
force up that powerful ticket by getting rid of one of the easy
challenges in today's Flop: Find a non-American flag. Okay. Oh, one fun fact about
this place is that because everything has to be shipped in by a plane and stuff, frozen pizzas are $20. (whispering) $20?! Isn't that crazy? Ben, I've got great news. Michael Angelo's Baked Ziti has a beautiful Italian flag on it. Mamma mia!
I feel transported! I feel transported to the
great nation of Italy. That's a ticket claimed. It's not a great ticket,
but it's a ticket. I think the more
interesting thing is... if something good can
come up in The Flop now. Yeah, okay. So let's go ahead.
Alright, let's generate. A random number. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. 1500 mile flight
to a coastal state. Have a picnic on the beach. While sitting on a beach, both team members
must share and enjoy at least three different foods. So, this is the best ticket that's in today's deck by far. Because here's the thing.
If we get this ticket, that means that we'll have not
only a flight to Anchorage, but we'll have a flight
straight out of Anchorage to... Seattle.
Seattle. Let's have a lovely little picnic. I'm feeling pretty good. Let's buy a
delicious candy treat. We deserve a treat. We can get some Cracker Jill. What the hell kinda
woke BS is this? Ooh, Pop Rocks. M&Ms. Three delicious foods. $7.98. Thank you. Having this ticket pop up
is kind of big for us. Yeah. I think it's gonna—
'Cause here's the thing. They're gonna get to
Anchorage by tonight, but they're not
gonna have a way out. They're not
gonna have a way out. So you would think
that Sam and I have a big lead because we're already on
a plane out of Utqiagvik. But the answer is no. Right now, Ben and Adam, I'm guessing they're doing
the picnic on the beach so that they can get down
to the contiguous 48. So they're definitely
gonna be able to get to Seattle. Tomorrow.
Tomorrow. We of course have the advantage of being able to get
to Anchorage tonight. But there's pretty much nothing much we can
do once we get there. Maybe one challenge, but we're
pretty much done for the night. We gotta get to Seattle. (rapping)
♪ Let's go to the beach, beach ♪ ♪ Let's go get away ♪ ♪ They say what they gonna say ♪ ♪ Have a drink, clink,
found a Bud Light ♪ ♪ Bad (bleep) like me
is hard to come by ♪ So true. (laughs) We have
arrived in Anchorage. Good night. Alright.
Thank you. Jet Lag.
Thank you. Thank you.
Good night. Okay, we just got here. Did you learn some news? I did. They were busy while
we were in the air. So they have gotten their
flight to Anchorage tomorrow. They've also won a flight to get to, most likely, Seattle. And they also found a
non-US flag, and now they have a car. So it means we've got
some work to do in the morning. But the good news is
we have a plan. So let's go do that. So here's the plan. Michelle and I need to
get to the lower 48. Driving would take 41 hours
and go through Canada. And there aren't any trains, so our only choice is to fly. And if we want to fly
direct to Seattle, not stopping in
Juneau or something, there's only one ticket
in tomorrow's deck that will get us there: a 1,600 mile flight you can earn by finding a moose
and telling it a joke. We need to find that ticket
and complete it fast tomorrow, because there's a
10 am flight to Seattle we really want to make. You start each day where
you ended the last day. So to optimize our chances, we're gonna end our day
in Earthquake Park, a supposed moose spotting hotspot. We can get there by taking an Uber, even though we don't
have a car ticket, because teams are allowed
to travel locally for free. Hello!
Hello. How are you? Okay, generate a
new card in the Flop. 400 mile car. Climb a tree. Climb up a tree to at least
4 feet off the ground. Okay, the new challenge
is to climb a tree. I don't think there are
any trees here, Ben. No, that one's not going
to be possible for us here. Alright Ben, do you want
to hear my assessment? Let's hear your
expert analysis. We have a full hand. I like our hand pretty well. There's no cards
currently in The Flop that would really be useful to us. Yeah.
So I say... we go to a hotel. Yeah, I mean, I think
we can just call it. I don't really want to be
out here when it's pitch black. Hello. (both giggle) We've made it to the park. There's a car that
we could do here, the climb a tree one. Correct.
It's for a car thing, which is not very useful right now. But we might as well.
We have space. Yeah, let's climb a tree. Honestly, right there. It literally looks like
we're in a horror movie, Sam. Ready for my skills? I'm so ready
for your skills, Sam. ♫ (hard rock music) Woo-hoo! Go, Sam! Woo-hoo! How do you feel up there? It's so much
better than down there. It's crazy. (wheezes)
It's breaking. Please get down
before you die! So the reason that
we came all the way here was to put our pin
in this place for a strategic
position for tomorrow. Wait, I need help.
Oh my god. It's 7:40. We're gonna call the day here. We'll see you in this exact spot. 8 am tomorrow morning. Good night! We're gonna hop on
a flight to Anchorage. This is our spot for the night. Good night! Now, it's the rest period. In this game, rest periods work the same way they do
in all of our games: No strategizing, no traveling,
and no challenges. But this time,
with one exception. If teams can manage
to book a bedroom on an overnight sleeper train
with one of their train cards, they are allowed to make progress
through the night on that train. That's not relevant
for tonight, though, so here's all you need to know: Tomorrow at 8 am, the game will restart from
these exact locations, and The Flop will be
wiped and replaced with four new tickets
from the new day's deck. But first, it's time for the teams to go to a hotel and sleep. Or at least, try to. It is 6 in the morning, and I could not sleep
at all last night. Every five minutes, I was having nightmares
about The Flop for today. Because that is how pivotal
today's Flop is for me and Sam. And you know what
makes it even worse? Stay with me. Today is the first day
of Scorpio season. Adam is a Scorpio. If you are a Scorpio
in Scorpio season, a Leo in Leo season,
whatever it is, that is when you are
at your peak. 'Cause here's what I think. Here's what I think. Here's what I think. You know what, actually,
I don't know what I think. Okay, now it's 8 am
and time to start day 2. (rooster crows) We are so back. (laughs) It's 8 am, it's still dark out, but we are back at
Earthquake Park. We need to FaceTime Ben and Adam.
Oh my god, I'm s— I am so anxious about this. Good morning. Boo! Good morning. Alright. Were you scared? Yeah, we were really scared.
Were we scared? Yeah, I'm scared. Alright, I am generating the cards. An 800 mile train. The challenge: Find a real gun. A 600 mile train: Spot a UFO. A 1,600 mile flight that is scheduled
to land at an even-numbered time. (whispers) Come on,
let's freaking go, let's go. The challenge is:
Amuse a moose. And the final ticket
is a 450 mile flight: Contribute to a waterfall. Okay! Okay.
Okay! Okay. See you in Key West! They seemed... They seemed pretty pleased. Okay, okay, okay.
We need a joke, we need a joke. This is really good. My gut is telling me... let's put a cap on how much time
we're looking for the moose. And if we don't find
the moose here in that time, we go to the waterfall. I think that's right. I think we want to spend,
realistically, we can't spend
more than 30 minutes looking for the moose.
Right. And still make
that 10 am flight. But we gotta start looking. Yeah, yeah.
Let's go, let's go. I'm looking for moose jokes. We'll worry
about the joke later. I mean, this raises
the obvious question. Are there moose in Utqiagvik? If you Google
'moose in Utqiagvik', an article from 2020 pops up that a moose was found here, but ""far from its natural habitat."" I don't like that us finding
a moose would be a news story. If you Google 'Anchorage moose', then the first article says ""How to find a moose in
Anchorage in less than an hour."" Okay, well, that's not great. Here's a map. We're there. So yeah, I think we
want to just take this trail in, basically, right? Yeah. Okay, so let's head... walk fast. So, do you think Adam and Ben are
gonna try and find a gun? Maybe, but I think
it could be tough there. There are other
challenges we could do. We could potentially do the— We could probably do the gun one.
We could probably do the UFO one. I personally don't want
to do either of those because I would worry that it would free up a spot in
The Flop for a good ticket. Yeah, since we're probably
going to be flying so much today, we want The Flop to be
as bad as possible. Yeah, I don't wanna
do them any favors. Hopefully it takes them
a long time to find the moose. Look, I know for a fact
that there are moose at the zoo, but the zoo
does not open until 10. And so otherwise
they're going to have to try and find one in the wild,
which is possible, but... Yeah.
Tough. This is tough. I mean, the light
really only goes... (whispers) I know.
20 feet in or so. Do you know
when moose wake up? No. Yeah, I don't know either. What sound do moose make? Do they moo like a cow? Their name would
imply it, I feel like. Oh, Ben, I got
some news for ya. It's really (bleep) cold. Yep. We've still got two hours
until our flight, so... Utqiagvik has a lovely
Iñupiat cultural heritage center. And so I say we walk to that, we see if there are
any moose on the way. Yeah.
And if not, we just sort of hang out there. I'm gonna go ahead and
tell you right now, Ben. Not seeing any moose so far. I'm not seeing anything. Me neither. You wanna go back and
then go to the left? Yeah, let's go this way, yeah. Okay, this path looks pretty good. I feel like the moose aren't
out for breakfast yet. ...for all 14 hours of darkness. Does this loop back around? I think eventually. I haven't seen any wildlife. Oh, this is like a trail. I certainly didn't know
where they hang out. Sam, Sam. Something moved up there. Something moved up there. Oh, it's a person.
God damn it. Moose check. Moose check. There's no moose. No moose. Polar bear check. No polar bears either. So, good news and bad news. But we did make it to the
Iñupiat Heritage Center. Alright, the woman at the front
said this is the best room. Get ready for the best room. Whaling Gallery. Whoa, this room does rock. This is the best room. Oh, that's beautiful. Dang. Huh. No moose on the coast? None. I think we need
to turn around, Sam. I know. Alright. It's okay. We've got the zoo as a backup. I feel like this is
the size of a big dog. I feel like it's not
intimidatingly big. I feel like if I saw this,
I'd be like, yeah. You think this is
the size of a big dog? I feel like it's the size
of a really big dog. I think you're
wrong about that. Yeah.
Is this our guy? Yeah, I think so. Is it weird for me
to ask the Uber driver if they have a gun on them? I've never been anywhere like this. We've arrived.
First of all... Gorgeous. Ignore the construction. Crazy! Beautiful!
Gorgeous. I guess we should
kind of just get to it. Let's fill it. That way,
maybe we can gain some of that quarter mile
distance we have to... So we're going to go
all the way to the brim? Ready? Yep. Okay, let's stay focused. No distraction. Oh my gosh, Ben. Look, it's a little tiny one. It's a little tiny doll. (whispers)
Oh my gosh, I want a little doll. I want— I would want to
have this doll so bad. Honestly, now that we're in it,
a quarter mile is a decent bit. Look at that view. (whispering)
I can't. Guys. Status report,
my hands are getting cold. Well, good news is it's 9 am. They have not yet informed
us of any moose spottings. And we are now
headed for the airport, because our flight leaves
in about 90 minutes. So, Sam and Michelle,
we're coming for ya. Status update, my hands are
getting very cold. No! Don't think about it, Sam. 0.24. Let's see if by the time
I get down there, we get to 0.25. 0.25! Alright.
That's it! A quarter mile hike! So this is waterfall-y,
right? Yeah. This is a waterfall. This is a waterfall. Yeah. Look at that.
Only lost a tiny bit. Definitely less than 10%.
That's like 1%. Killer.
Ready? I have an idea. Yeah? Can we sing
""Don't Go Chasing Waterfalls""? ♪ Don't go chasing waterfalls ♪
♪ –go chasing waterfalls ♪ ♪ Just stick to the rivers ♪
(humming) ♪ And the something
you're used to ♪ Hell yes. Time to FaceTime
Ben and Adam! What's up?
Hello! Please tell me that
you didn't find a moose. Oh, no. But we just showed this
waterfall who's boss. Yeah! It's a nice looking waterfall. Well, enjoy that 450 mile flight. Have fun with that. (giggles)
Enjoy your flight. Bye, guys!
Bye. Bye. Well... We were kind of hoping. I mean, we were hoping
that they would be stupid. We were hoping that
they were going to waste a lot of time trying
to find a moose. Yeah.
And not find one. What they did instead... is they're clearly waiting
for the zoo to open. (sigh) It's fine, it's fine. I mean, I'm honestly
just more nervous about what shows up next on The Flop. Can you do The Flop?
Yeah. 600 mile flight to a
state that borders the Pacific. Planespot from across the Pacific. Planespot, from the
end of the runway, four aircraft that cross
the Pacific Ocean from Asia, Hawaii, or Australia. It's good?
Eh... Okay, that's a pretty
good card, unfortunately. We can't do that here. I mean, the only plane
we can spot is the one that we're
about to take. (long sigh) Shoot. And they're probably going
to get that before we land. I don't think that's
worth optimizing for. 'Cause the only reason
we'd want to do that is if we wanted to go
to California. I think the next
challenge we want to do is the zoo at 10. The other idea is we can ...find a gun. Well, where would
we even go for the gun? Like Walmart? (dial tone) Thank you
for calling Walmart. How can I help you? Hey there,
I was calling to see if you guys have
a firearms section. Yes, we do. Okay, thank you so much. Let's go! Let's go! I'm so excited. (bleep) It's not great. It's not looking good
for Team Badam. So we're gonna get
into Anchorage at 12:30. There is a flight from
Anchorage to Seattle at 1:00. Which we could take. Which we have a ticket
that lets us get on. But the thing is,
you aren't allowed to book more than one move in advance. Right. So we would have to book after we got off our plane. Yeah. And we might not be
able to book that late. Yeah, I mean,
I think our only hope is that our flight gets in early. Let's look at what
flights they could take. 'Cause I feel like we might be... I feel like maybe I'm
getting ahead of myself here. Wait, what was that
notification I just got? What notification? (groaning sigh) What?
Michelle, I have news. Why are you acting like that? Because it
doesn't sound good. What if I told you
it was good? What is it? Ben and Adam's flight – at least their inbound aircraft – is an hour and a half delayed. Oh my god! Skippity doo dah ay! Oh my god, this is crazy! What is your
impression of Adam Chase when he found out that
the flight was delayed? No. No! Noooo! That's my impression. Yeah, that's pretty accurate.
He repeats himself. 'Cause he goes through
all of the... The stages of grief? He goes through all of
them in five seconds. It's crazy. No no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no. No no no no no. This is really
really really really really really really really bad. So now we're gonna get
in probably around 2:00. (snickers) We cannot catch a break
this game. We get in at 1:39.
1:39. (bleep) We would have to try
to get on the 2:25. That's pretty possible, though. Maybe. We would land
46 minutes before it leaves. Normally, we can't book... 45 minutes is the cutoff. It's those kind of margins
that make the show fun, though. Eh? Right? Hey, for Sam.
Hello! Okay, so here's the thing. Here's the thing.
What's the thing? So, their flight
seems to get in now, probably around 1:30-ish. But the last flight
that they could get out ...is at 2:25. No! To Seattle before... Before the end of the rest—
Before the rest period starts. So they might not even make
it to the lower 48 today. They might just get stuck here. Okay. Isn't it—
Put on the gas, Sam. Those are fishing rods. These are not. Oh my god! So we have found a firearm. Okay, should we call them? Therefore,
challenge complete. Let's call them. (dial tone) Why are they calling us? Hey guys. I want to show
you something. Oh. It's a gun. You're showing us a gun? Okay. We do have to go, but... Shouldn't you be boarding
your flight by now? What a great question.
You know what? That tone that you're
taking with us makes me think that
you know why we're not. Have fun, kids. Bye. Oh, no! Ben and Adam looked so sad. (gasps) Wait, we have to update
The Flop. Yes.
Okay. Well, let's
just do it right now. I'm gonna get my phone. 400 mile car. Cry. Produce any actual tears,
using any means necessary. 400 mile car. Cry. Okay, I mean, easy.
We could do that. We could, but
do we even want that? Well, if we do it, then we get another one
up on the board. Okay, true. At the zoo,
we're gonna do it. We're gonna cry at the zoo. Oh, yes. How are you guys? Doing well, thank you.
Hey, for Sam? Yeah.
How's it going? (snickers) This is so bad. Egh... We have arrived
at the Alaska Zoo. Enjoy your visit.
Thank you. Hello, Mr. Yak. Hi, Camel. Hello. We're trying to simultaneously... Cry.
Cry, and find the moose. (giggles) Almost there. Oh my god!
He already started? What is going on? I'm not even trying.
This is crazy. You're insane, Sam. You're insane. You're so clinical about this. I was like, I'm gonna think
about something very, very sad. And Sam is just like,
computing a tear over here. Wait, wait, wait. Can you see it? I do see. Oh, Sam! Has it teared yet? No. Oh, god! Oh, look at that.
Here, let me call Ben and Adam. Another call. Do you see my tears? I was thinking about how
sad you must feel right now. Sam! Alright, we gotta go, bye! Bye.
Bye. So, as expected, they are
barreling through tickets to try to make
something good pop up. Hopefully...
something befalls them. Sam? Wait, wait. Where is the moose? No. Can someone tell me
why we're at a zoo next to the moose exhibit and there's not
a moose in here? I'm gonna say I'm extremely
concerned right now. This is not great. Maybe down here? There's a road
that goes down here. Here's another moose exhibit. Moose exhibit. No moose. (whispering)
What is going on? Am I going crazy? There it is! There it is!
There it is! Do you see it? Hi, moose! Oh my god, finally! Sam, you've
got to tell it your joke. So, Mr. Moose... What do you call it when
a moose gets scared? Moosebumps. You guys are
obsessed with calling us. Yeah, leave us alone. Chill the (bleep) out, maybe. Do you see our friend? Yeah. Yeah, we see him. Alright, we gotta go, bye.
Bye. Bye. (heavy sigh) Let's go!
Don't have much time. We gotta get to the airport,
get through security quick. There's our plane, Ben. It is here. Alright, well,
let's go get on it. So, it's 11 am. If we can get on that plane and get out,
in the next 20 minutes, we're probably okay. Have a good one.
Thank you. What is this,
our fourth time here? 11:14. I don't know. I don't know, I'm nervous. Ben and Adam. Yeah, thank you.
Thank you. Let's do it. Okay, well it's good. We got a lot of people
coming out now. They're putting away
the cones. Okay, that seems good. Maybe that guy's the last guy. No, maybe that guy's
the last guy. That guy dropped
something, get it together. Is this where you took us
for lunch the other day? Yeah. Wanna eat there again? I don't know if we'll have
time for a sit down spot like that. So, Sam. Michelle. I'm a little sad because
we've been together for several days now,
even before filming. And there's something I did
that you haven't noticed. To my body. Did you get a haircut? No, I didn't get—
You did your nails. I did Jet Lag nails! The plane is moving. The flight attendant said that she'd know we were
going to get in at 1:33. 1:33 would be fine. I think we can work with that. Flight's getting in... It's 1:40.
Late. The flight that
we need to get on leaves in 45 minutes. And it's not booked. We have not— We can't book it. We can't book it until
we're off this plane. We don't know when
the cutoff is. We can't figure it out. Ben's, you've been
doing a ton of research. Seems to maybe be
a half an hour. But some things
have said 45 minutes. Some things
have said 45 minutes. If we can't book this flight,
we are so (bleep)-ed. I mean, I genuinely am really,
really, really worried about it. And if you guys
could do me a favor, I do have two gentlemen
that are trying to make a very, very tight connection for a very special race
that they're working on. If you would do me a favor
and let them hop up before you so they can try and win this race, I would greatly,
greatly appreciate it. B8. You said B8. This is C8. Hi. Is there any chance
it's still possible to book a ticket on this flight? Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Are they gonna let
me and Ben on the plane? That's the question. That was the question that we had. That's probably the
question that you have too. I would love to find out. It's a great question, and you could find out
the answer right now because episode 3 is
out right now on Nebula. So we put every episode up
one week early on Nebula. So you could go... Oh, are you checking
to see if it's on there? Yeah.
Well, by gum. Wait, is it? Yeah.  Yes.
Woah! What? Wait, let me... That's crazy! Wait, do we get on the plane? It's very surprising,
the answer to that question. Oh my gosh! And I'm really glad that
I clicked through and found out.
Uh-huh. Listen, we know that
if you're watching this, you haven't been convinced by
signing up to Nebula so far. And one of the reasons
could be, you know, there's just too many subscriptions. There's a subscription
for everything these days. We know this, you know this,
everyone knows this. So we did— We do have
a special offer for those of you that are just
peak subscription fatigue. But if you just want
to pay once and be done and never think about
paying for Nebula again: It's an offer. We are— We have a Lifetime
membership offer right now for a limited time for the holidays. And it's really that simple. One fee, you just pay it, done. Nebula access for life,
Jet Lag early access for life, all of the other stuff
on Nebula for life. I mean, there's really not
much more to say than that. It's a Lifetime membership. It's available for a limited time. Yeah It's like instead of renting
Nebula every month or year, you just own Nebula.
Yeah. Well, just not legally, but yes. (guffaws) And that, you know,
it gets you a lifetime of access, not just to Jet Lag, like Sam said, but to, you know... a huge library of content
from other creators. You know, shows,
documentaries, podcasts. One is Patrick Willems. The great Patrick Willems
just put out a... Holiday Special about Star Wars. It's very, very fun, and... No spoilers, but... Three of your favorite
globetrotting nerds may make an appearance
in this special. We are in fact— The set is behind the
iconic Jet Lag void. Oh my god,
there's another camera. We can cut to the other angle. Oh wow.
Do you see the set? Hello!
There's a little taste of it. That's a lot of fun.
That just went up on Nebula. And it's just, again,
it's just a drop in the bucket of other amazing content
that you can find on Nebula. No matter how
you want to sign up, whether it's the Lifetime membership,
an annual or a monthly, you can do so at
nebula.tv/jetlag. And when you do,
it'll help support the show. It'll give us a portion
of your subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed, which helps us, you know,
make this show bigger, better, cooler. Is that all the words?
Yeah, that's all the words. But anyway, go to that: nebula.tv/jetlag or click
the button on screen. And thanks in advance
for your support. Good bye!
Happy holidays! (loud clap)
Alright. Oh, that was crisp. That was a really good clap.
Thank you. I wish we could put
that in the ad read. That would convince
people to get it. Okay."

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","Qfb9eVgksms","We're here in
Utqiagvik, Alaska, the northernmost city in America. And over the next five days, we're going to be
using a combination of planes... trains... and automobiles... to race all the way
to Key West, Florida, the southernmost town
in America. But right now, it's 3 pm. There's only one flight
out of here in just over two hours, and there's only one ticket
that can get us on it. So we have got to... go, go, go, go, go!
(yelps) Oh my god, Michelle!
This is for real, this time! Ben, Ben. Okay, okay.
Okay, we have to— The Flop is gonna happen, so... we have to see
what's on it. The Flop will be a motion graphic
that you'll see now. Okay, here's
how this game works. Right now, we're in the
northernmost town in America. The first team to get
to Key West, Florida, the southernmost town in
continental America, wins. But, in order to get there, we need to chain together
over 4,000 miles of planes, trains, and automobiles all the way across the country. But it's not as simple as just
booking a flight to Florida. In this game,
teams will need to pay for their transportation
with tickets, which they'll earn by
completing challenges. Every morning,
four tickets will go into a shared pool called The Flop. Each ticket allows a team to take
a specific form of transportation, like a 300-mile car or
direct flight to Anchorage. Either team can earn
one of these tickets by completing the
challenge attached. And once a ticket has
been claimed, the other team can't get it. For now, that's all
you need to know. Oh, and one last thing: The only way to get
out of Utqiagvik today is a single flight
that leaves in two hours. So let's see who can get on it. So, challenges,
challenges, challenges. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It looks like, okay,
so there's only one ticket that will get us out of here today, and it is the
build a snowman challenge. Okay, so they're
gonna be doing that too. Okay.
Okay. The only one that's gonna get us
to Anchorage is the snowman, so we gotta do the snowman. I assume that they're
gonna compete for it. I'm assuming that
you're competing for the snowman?
Yeah, we're doing it too. Build a snowman on the beach. Construct a snowman out of
natural snow on any beach. If both teams compete in this
challenge simultaneously, the winning snowman will be
determined by a Twitter poll conducted 45 minutes after
snowman construction begins. Okay, so 45 minute
countdown starts— 45 minute
countdown starts now. Bye, losers!
(shrieks) Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Okay. So, we have to strategize.
We gotta talk snowman strategy. And the beach is right here. This is the Arctic Ocean,
by the way. This is literally
the Arctic Ocean. Okay, so I'm assuming that they are headed into town
to get supplies. Wait, wait,
they're going to the beach. But why are they
going to the beach? I don't know, but—
We need supplies! Wait, do we? Okay, do you know the way? Yeah.
Okay, you studied. It's right then left
to the grocery store. I did study! Well, we gotta
be quick at the store. We don't want to waste time. What are they doing?
I don't know. Why are they standing there? What do they know
that we don't? (bleep bleep) I think they're
making a mistake. There is a grocery store in town, but it's a bit of a walk. How far is the store? Six minute walk thru—
Six minutes? (bleep) I wonder, do you think
they're not doing supplies? Don't worry about them.
Focus on our strategy. I know, but keep in mind, our strategy is their strategy. Our strategy is opposing theirs. I think what we do is,
we use the full amount to make the biggest
snowman possible. And it'll just dwarf their snowman. We can decorate it with
stuff that's on the beach. Yeah. (panting heavily) What do you think they're doing? (strained grunts) Okay, that's not gonna move. Okay.
Okay, we gotta be quick. No, we should see if they
have charcoal for the eyes. Fruits? I have an idea. What if it's the Chiquita woman with the banana hat? Yeah? So I think the move, Ben... Let's just start, just... We put together as many
clumps as possible. Ohh... ohh... ohh. Here, look how
expensive that is. Fifteen bucks. Do you think
we need to have... alcohol in its hand
or next to it? No, there's no alcohol here. Oh, right.
Come on, let's stay focused. There we go.
Candy! Those are shapes.
Those are animals. What about these?
These are pretty long. That looks like hair, yeah. That does look like hair. How about Serry Chours— Cherry Sours for the smile? Because we're going
candy theme. I guess?
Candy theme, that's it. That's the theme. That's the scene.
What else do we need? Do we need a hat? Carrot nose! Oh, this clump? I got this clump! Oh, (bleep)
Oh, that clump's huge! That's certainly
the biggest clump we've ever had on this show. Here's the thing! At a certain point,
it's gonna have to start being in the shape of
a snowman though. That is true, but you know... It's a very open-ended prompt. It's true. What is a man, you know? What does it mean
to be a man? Who's to say? Lookit.
Okay, we gotta get back. Are we getting
one of these hats? Hat. ♪ Hi! ♪ The pink one's pretty cute.
Yeah? Thank you so much!
Have a good afternoon. Oh my god.
Come on, Sam! We're running. Every minute counts! So I'm thinking one
approach that could work well is taking those
big boulders of snow and kinda whittling them down. Yes. ♪ Clump it up ♪ ♪ Clump it when you're startin'
with your head round ♪ Let's try that,
see if that works well, versus a rolling strategy. Yes, correct. No rolling. Waste of time. It only works in
Charlie Brown cartoons. Ben, I'm gonna take a clump. Yeah.
I'm gonna roll it around in the really soft
snow up here. 'Cause that's the way you're
supposed to build a snowman. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is...
It's not really working. No. Does it look bigger? Uh, maybe. There's the whale arch. Let's make sure not to
show them what we bought. Should we pretend
the store was closed? We're gonna lie to them? Like psychological
warfare, right? Oh, Ben, there they are. There they are? (Sam and Michelle panting) Well, you guys made the
right call not going to the store. Was it closed? Yeah, they had a power failure.
Yeah. So the store was...
Uh-oh! ...straight-up closed.
Don't talk to them, Sam! We don't have time to
tell them what happened! Okay, yeah. There we go. They believed it.
They believed it. Power failure. I wonder if they're lying,
and they got stuff, and they don't want
us to know about it until it's too late. That's like... I mean, come on! How did you get
that many big ones? Okay... What the hell is Ben doing? Ah, (bleep) (icicle cracks)
Oh (bleep), that— That mother-(bleep)
almost impaled me. It's kind of like I'm
just spanking our snowman. He's a bad boy.
Huh? Our snowman's a bad boy. (hollow thumping)
What are you doing? Okay, that's very promising. Okay, I think we need to
start working on outfit and such. When you focus on styling. Okay.
But we need a head. Huh? I'm kind of turned on.
Sure feels a woman. Oh, that looks—
That looks— Holy (bleep) Okay, it's precarious.
Don't touch it. Move! Sam, get your ass over here!
We're not done! Oh, you brought snacks. Oh my god, Michelle, where
did you find the carrots? Oh, the store
wasn't really closed! No, we found these
on the side of the road. This was Sam's idea!
I didn't wanna lie to you guys! I feel like he didn't
get us that bad with that. 'Cause the hole needs
to be smaller than the carrot. Oh, yes.
Yeah, let's pack it in. Oh (bleep), the carrot
actually looks really good. Yeah, it's iconic. Oh (bleep),
they bought a hat. Oh my gosh,
they have gummies. Sour S'ghetti hair, huh? I need you to move
faster to ignore them! (mutters) It's not opening! I don't know how to
put another arm in this thing. I think it's fine. It's incomplete!
We have 10 seconds! Now what do we need?
We have 10 seconds! Okay, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no, no, no!
Don't (bleep) risk it! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Hands off!
(bleep) Oh no.
Okay. Alright, I mean,
we have to really hurry. So, post the poll. Okay, which is
the best snowman? Twitter poll. How do you feel?
Honestly? Theirs is
really good, Sam. Pretty impressive
for no materials, but I feel like
we should get credit for getting materials. I know, but... Ours is pretty
cute looking, though. Look at her. Damn, look at her. Look at this fine lady. I'm checking her out. Let's pull up Alaska Airlines and get 100% ready to book. Sam is pre-filling out
our flights. We're honestly filling out
the flights as a formality, because I think we lost. Their snowman is so good! I really don't
want to get stuck here. I think that... the soonest we would
get out of here if we lost this would
be tomorrow morning. I am still worried about
even making this flight though. Me too.
It's going to be (bleep) tight. It's going to be tight. A snowman
is determining our fate! Our fate will be determined
by many stupider things over the next five days. I'm gonna be honest, and I really hope this
doesn't bite me in the ass... I feel confident. Okay, Ben, let's
get our backpacks on to wait for the reveal. Let's get ready to go. Okay, here we go. Poll ending. It says poll ending. 765 votes. Oh my god,
it's loading right— I'm gonna throw up.
I'm literally gonna throw up. Okay, okay,
wait, wait, wait, okay. Let's gooo!
(others scream) Go! Go! Go! Wait, I don't have my backpack. Get your backpack, let's go!
That was astounding! Bye, boys! Wait, I gotta book the flight.
Bye, Ben and Adam! I gotta book the flight. (whispering) Bye! Bye, Michelle! This is crazy!
The biggest win is that we don't have to stand
out here in this cold doing challenges now. If we don't
miss this flight! Come on, book it!
Yes. I'm gonna be honest,
I'm shocked. I'm shocked and appalled. Let's refresh the Flop.
I'm generating a new one. 800 mile flight.
Dance like nobody's watching. Get 1,000 feet away from the nearest building that
could contain people. Once stationed,
both team members must memorize and
successfully perform Amy's TikTok dance,
at tempo, with no mistakes. Okay... It's dance like nobody's watching. Okay, that's another ticket
that can get us out of here. That ticket would get us out, but we have to get 1,000 feet
from the nearest building. Okay.
Okay. Let's start walking. Okay.
Monday, October 23rd. Is that right?
Today's Monday, yes. And who are you?
Michelle Asha Khare. And what's your channel? I'm Michelle Khare.
Follow, like, subscribe, thanks. And what do you do? Oh, I host a show
called Challenge Accepted, which is all about me trying the world's most
intense professions and lifestyles and communities. And why are you here?
I'm here... because Sam let me
do this for finally. And what's your
social security number? Alright, let's hustle
a little bit. We're not going to
let this set us back. No.
Never bet against the boys. So, I mean, the ticket
that's available now could still get us
to Anchorage tonight. It's just that, as we've mentioned, the flight leaves in
an hour and a half. And we have to get
1,000 feet from a building and learn this dance. Wait.
I'm very excited. What do you mean, wait? Sorry.
What do you mean, wait? Well, the flight
didn't go through. I tried to pay for it,
and it didn't go through. Did it book? No.
What do you mean, no?! I don't know, it keeps
giving me an error. An error? Okay, so it turns out, the place where
I think we can do this is like a mile away. We're still gonna try. 'Cause the flight leaves
in 70 minutes, so... I mean, even if we got there
20 minutes before it left... we could probably still board. Okay, gonna attempt this again. Please, god. If not, we can probably
get it at the airport. Nope. No?
No. Okay, let's go. Let's get to the airport. Wait, let me try
one more thing. Oh, Sam! We're gonna miss the
plane that we earned! Are Ben and Adam okay? They'll be fine. So Ben, one real
actual thing is that we genuinely have to
watch out for polar bears. Yeah. There, it's supposedly... peak polar bear season.
Uh-huh. There are (bleep)-loads
of polar bears here. Uh-huh. And we've seen lots
of signs being like... ""Don't get eaten."" So I think all of this is
technically part of a lagoon, so I don't know if
we can walk on that. Whoa, the snow's pretty deep. This feels quite... I think we're good. I feel like I'm trying
to walk in such a way that I don't... sink down. Oop. (dogs barking) Left. Yeah. Okay, we have made it to... the middle, truly,
of nowhere, finally. Oh my god. That's a plane. Oh, is that the plane
that they're gonna get on? It has to be, it's the only plane. It's the only plane. Ticket counter. (gasps)
(phone ringing) The ticket counter's closed. Oh no. It's over here, I think. Oh my god. (exhaustedly) Hi. Hi. (indistinct)
Huh? We need a ticket. Are there still seats
on this plane? Correct. Yeah, we tried to
do it online just earlier. Oh, because it
wouldn't go through online. Okay, okay. What's the number? So, if we can do this, we have to learn and perform
a TikTok dance out here. And if we can do it fast enough,
we can get on that plane. Let's do it.
Okay, here we go. ♪ And nothing seems like fun ♪ ♪ When you've dropped
your ice cream cone ♪ ♪ And you walked
the whole way home ♪ ♪ What can you do
to turn it around ♪ Oh no, it seems involved. ♪ What can you do
to turn it around ♪ ♪ Wiggle your toes
Clap your hands ♪ Oh god! It's so complicated. ♪ Stomp your feet
Get ready to dance ♪ ♪ And shake it like you got
ants in your pants ♪ ♪ Wiggle your— ♫ (bleep) I don't think we're
getting on that plane. The (bleep)? Oh my god, Amy! This is so complicated.
And a one, and a two. Sam is calling, because
we can't buy a ticket here. And we have like ten minutes
to try and book this flight. Oh my god. I'm gonna get out my computer
and try my computer too. (grunts) Drop your ice cream cone,
sad, sad. I turn and I go,
shoot, doop, doop. I'll be facing forward. And then we turn it
around like this. Shoo, shoo. Okay, then it's
just (bleep) kicking. Boop, boop. And then we go, boop,
boop, boop, boop. We are so (bleep)-ed.
Yeah, we're (bleep)-ed. I just nearly had
four panic attacks, heart attack, and
self-implosion in a row. Because it wasn't
booking on the phone. We get here,
they don't book in person. But thankfully,
we got it on a laptop. And with three minutes
to spare before it closed. (muttering) What can you do
to turn it around? Oh, I turned around too early. One, two, three, four. Oh no, that's the Vogue!
Shake it! Ohh. Tss, tss. No, you did it too early. I am gonna go ahead
and let you know, Ben, that it has just started snowing. And a bop, bop, wiggle your— No, no, no.
It's, you have to little pause. It's a bump, and a bump,
and— no, no. One, two, three, four, wait. Yeah, we're for
sure gonna die out here. We're gonna— We— The plane leaves in 40 minutes. The entirety of the airport. It's so...
The airport is this room. Yes.
(giggles) And there's nothing past security. You just go through security and board the plane, that's it. You know, I genuinely
still can't believe that we're getting on this,
because I thought Ben and Adam's snowman
was so good. It was very good.
It was so good. Yeah. What can you do
to turn it around? Oh wait, (bleep) Two, three, four! Oh wait, (bleep)! I always forgot what to do. Okay, polar bear check. Oh yeah, polar bear check.
Polar bear check. No polar bears at the moment. That's good. That's positive.
That's good. Vogue! No, (bleep)! It wasn't Vogue!
It's stop, then Vogue! This is... not going well. (bleep)-ing hell. Ugh. Hi there.
Hey. Your jacket is inside out. Just as an FYI. That is really where I am
mentally right now. Everything about the
past hour of my life has made me see
maximums today. Yes, anyway. We are officially on the aircraft. (whispering)
We're on the plane today. Very little more
can go wrong now. Why would
you say that, Sam? (sniffles)
One, two, three, four! I do, I do, do. What can you do
to turn it around? Nice! One, two three, four.
Vogue, Vogue. I think that was it! I think that one... I think we got it, baby! We do have to notify them. Okay. So I'm gonna call
Sam and Michelle. Heugh... okay, it's recording. I am duty-bound to
inform you that we have... danced like nobody is watching. Furthermore, I just
would like to mention as a piece of
personal information... that I'm extremely
(bleep)-ing cold. And it started snowing... about ten minutes
into us doing the dance. But see you on
your flight, losers. We only have to walk
two miles. We are, we're
gonna get on that flight. The one we're on? You're trying to get on
this plane? Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna
work out perfectly. Be scared. Be afraid. Okay. Good luck.
Good luck! Cool. Do you think they're
actually trying to get here? No.
No. No. Here's what I'll say. I can see the plane.
There it is. And it has not,
it hasn't left yet. Look, we keep
walking towards that plane until it's not there anymore. That's what I say. Bye, Ben and Adam. This is a robust taxi. If I'm fully honest, I actually really miss
Ben and Adam. They're really fun.
Really? Yeah. They're so fun. Adam, what do you
think are in these pipes? Water. Oh. You don't have a
very whimsical mind. Oh, sorry, what do
you think's in these pipes? Chocolate. So it's... it's kind of a
Native-designed salmon thing. That's so cool. Ben and Adam
are gonna cut this. They hate facts about planes. (giggles) Let me get the plane. (loud rumbling) Bye, Ben and Adam! (wind surging) I'm hearing
a noise that I don't like. Oh, (bleep) Well... That is... bad. That is the only plane
out of here today. Which means... we are here until
tomorrow morning at least. Wait, get your hand in here. There's someone there. Bye! Smudged. Yee-haw. Hwoop! This is make or break. Find alcohol,
find alcohol, find alcohol. Now I look like a maniac running across the parking lot
with a sandwich in hand, but that's what Jet Lag does to ya! Oh my god, what? No way. Ben and Adam editing this? I'm mad at you! Come on! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus All that and more
this season on Jet Lag! It's a super exciting one, and you can see it all
one week early if you're a Nebula subscriber. Just to especially
entice you right now, I'm putting up two shots
from episode two. Okay, this is me and Michelle. We're reacting to the
same thing that happened. It's this big unexpected
thing that happens. And you could find out
what that thing is and what's making us
make these faces... Right now.
The episode's up right now on Nebula! So if you're watching this,
we know that you haven't signed up
for Nebula yet. And...
And that's okay. Part of that might be
because, of course, there's a lot of recurring
monthly fees that you have to pay. And it's kind of stressful for those all to stack
and stack and stack. But we have an option for that. It's a limited time deal. To be honest,
it's not the cheapest way to get access to Nebula, but it's a different way
to get access to Nebula. And it's called Lifetime. Basically, you pay one fee, and you get lifetime
access to Nebula. That's it, it's really that simple. And it allows us to
really grow the platform. A surprising amount of people
seem to like having it, which is why we brought it back. This is now the
third time that we have it. So, it's available.
Link in the description. And if you're looking
for the perfect holiday present for the Jet Lag nerd in your life, you can now gift
Lifetime Subscriptions. Just go to nebula.tv/gift, you put it in their email,
you write a little note, and you'll be giving them a
present that will last a lifetime. And in addition to getting
to see next episode early, Nebula is a whole
streaming service. It's got tons of
amazing original shows and documentaries
and podcasts from all your favorite creators. And one of those is our
aftershow podcast, The Layover. Every week after the show, we get together with the
guest this season, Michelle. And we talk about what happened. We break it down, we do some behind the scenes stuff. Talk about how
we designed the game. Talk about how
we designed the game. Get into the nitty-gritty
of the strategy. Lots of fun stuff. So if you're interested
in diving deeper, The Layover is
a great way to do it. And you can obviously only
listen to that on Nebula. I think that that's a very
good reason to be on Nebula. But, the thing is, there's more than 100
other creators on Nebula, and they're all doing
exceptional stuff. They're making original content. They're releasing stuff early.
They're doing exclusive stuff. It's really, you know,
designed to be the best home to the stuff
that a creator makes. And, you know, that also
extends to the business model because the creators get a
portion of your subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed, which is really good, stable, recurring monthly income
that we can rely on without the ebbs and flows
of, you know, ad rates. If you click the button on screen
or the link in the description, you can sign up
using our code and... Please use our code. Yeah, not like
Real Engineering's, but... Thank you in advance
for your support. And good bye! Good bye!"

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","vXthU0h0pOQ","Hello, and welcome to the finale of
Tag Across Europe. At the end of the last episode, we came inches
from catching Ben here in Howald, Luxembourg. We had boarded Ben's train,
thinking we had him trapped. But Ben, not even realizing
that we were in Howald, had gotten off on our
platform to transfer trains. Now, we're being sent
back up to Luxembourg station
on an empty train, and he's about to hop
on a train that goes further into his region towards Metz and Nancy. There are just over seven
hours left in the game, and it's still a toss-up. If none of us make it to
our win location by 8 pm, then the win
is going to go to whoever's region
the Runner is in at the end of the game. If we can catch Ben
within the next few hours, then Adam might have
enough time to make it back
to his territory. So let's see if we can recover
from this game-changing swerve. He's not on the train. He must have gotten off. He's definitely still there,
and he's showing live. We just got swerved. He must have
seen us getting off. (sighs) You gotta respect that. When's the
next train from there? What's that station called? Oh no. What, is there a good one? Okay. There is my train. I'm getting on it.
The question is: Are Adam and Sam on it too? If they are, there's
nothing I can do about it. Well, it's been a few minutes,
and I don't see Sam and Adam, so I think
that means that either they didn't realize that
I was transferring trains, or they weren't in Luxembourg
at all to begin with. Either way is very good news, 'cause that means we're
getting pretty freaking far. Adam.
Yeah? He's on it. We just set him up
perfectly for that, Jesus. I mean, that's pretty incredible. Oh man, just perfect
connection to the exact spot. Here's what I wonder.
I wonder if he was just planning on
taking that transfer. But that train stops
at Bettembourg, so we should've
just gotten off there. Does it?
Yeah. Oh yeah, it does.
Yeah, weird. No, he must have spotted us. Well, I guess
we need to get on the next train to Metz then. This gets into Metz at 1:27. He'll have a 30-minute lead. 30 minutes, geez.
So ours is slower? Yeah, ours is slightly slower. Alright, well let's
get to the platform. Wow! Damn. That is embarrassing. Wow! I mean, how can you
hate him for that? I mean, it's just
good gameplay there. Yeah, uh-oh. It's fine. Once we get to Nancy, at least we'll be
comfortably in my territory. And then we can start
playing really unpredictably. And that is gonna be fun. We've already been playing
a little unpredictably, but it's because
there was a rat that was controlling my mind. This time, it will
just be me for fun. Okay, see you in Nancy. Good bye, Luxembourg! We might actually
already be out it. It's pretty small.
No, we're not. Not yet. I checked. I can't believe that.
I can't believe that. That's crazy that
he pulled that off. Yep. You gotta respect it. He's officially in France. (sigh) Bonjour to him. They speak French in
Luxembourg, too, but... Okay, well... Bonjour to us. Yes. Bonjour to everyone, really, in a larger sense. Yeah. Except the... Except the
Chinese Communist Party. Yeah. Not bonjour to the
Chinese Communist Party. Not a fan.
To them, I wish them adieu. Okay, so now something
kinda weird happened. While Ben was on
his train to Nancy, he found a train from Metz to a tiny town
called Bar-le-Duc that only leaves every
four and a half hours. If he could catch
the next one and get himself
trapped out there, it would be almost
impossible to catch him by the end of the game. The thing is,
he only found this route as his train was pulling
into Metz station. So he panicked and
got off his train, not yet realizing that he
didn't have enough coins to take the train
to Bar-le-Duc, and that the next
train from Luxembourg, which we happened to be on,
was going to arrive before he could
leave the station. Okay, I've gotten
off my train at Metz. There is a train
from here to Bar-le-Duc in half an hour. And there's not another
train until 6:30. So if I get on that
and I get to Bar-le-Duc, I think that they're gonna have
a really hard time getting there. I think I'm gonna be... kinda, I don't know. I'll be all posted up. I'm sorry,
I'm a little frantic. I just realized this
all at the last second. I don't have enough
coins to get there. So I have to pull a challenge, and I have to be
able to do it here. Okay, that's the situation. That's the situation. Okay. Cursed!
For the rest of your run, veto periods last
three times longer. I'm not vetoing it! I am not gonna veto that,
and in fact... I may not even have to pull
another challenge this game. So this might have saved me. Okay. Now I just have to figure out that train to Bar-le-Duc. Bar-le-Duc. Okay, it's not
for a little while. It's not until 2:06. So as long as they
can't get here, okay. Bleh. As long as they can't
get here before 2:06, I'm getting on that train,
and then I think I'm safe. So the question is,
are they gonna get here? Oh (bleep), okay. I have to do some research. I have to see
where they could get. Oh, I'm shaking,
I'm shaking, I'm shaking. It looks... I mean, it's 1:33. Ben's train should've
left at 1:32, but it seems like he's
still in the station. Yeah, I mean, sometimes
these are tracker errors, but... I mean, it shows live. We'll see. Yep. I mean, we are gonna
be at Metz, where he is, in 20 minutes.
Mhm. Okay, so... I may have (bleep)-ed myself. If they can get here to Metz... before I get on that train... then... I'm finished. Because there are
no other trains... that I can get on. But if I get on that train, I think I might win... there and then, pretty much. So, it comes down to this. Are Sam and Adam
about to arrive in Metz, or aren't they?
I don't know. Well, he's still there.
Ohh, he's still there. He's still at Metz. We will be there
in six minutes. Ben? I think— I think it's
the end of the line. I think that you're—
Hey, train pun! That was good.
That was good. Thank you. Adam, what are you
researching? Nothing.
Nothing? Nothing.
You're just on Twitter? Yep.
Okay. What does Twitter say about
the train routes to Germany? Shut up. Adam... We are basically here. Mm-kay. Still shows
him in the station, so this could be a
tricky search. And that also means that
he could be on a platform, or on a train that
is about to leave. I guess
I might as well hide, because there is a
possibility that they are on that
next train to Metz. That does get here
just before the train that I want to take. So, if they are on it, I guess I want to waste... as much more of
their time as I can. Oh, there he is. There he is.
He's running. Where is he running? I see him.
I'll go get him. Is he running to
the other platform? You sure you saw him?
No, I saw him. Is that him? Wait... I thought I saw him. Adam!
Yeah? On the tracker, he's that way. Okay. Just in case... Adam and Sam get here before my train to Bar-le-Duc... I'm gonna hide
in this photo booth. I guess I might as well get
some photos while I'm here. Choisissez votre produit
en touchant l'écran. Attention, ces photos
ne sont pas conformes pour les documents officiels. Souhaitez-vous continuer? I don't know
what these words mean. It kind of looks like he's
in this main hall over here. That train's not
going anywhere, is it? He couldn't have
just gotten on it. I mean, there is
a train to Nancy leaving in two minutes, but... On another—
Wait, where's that? I don't know. Oh, shoot! It looks like he's in here. Please look straight ahead. Ready? Three, two, one. Wait, wait, where's
the train to Nancy? Platform A. It leaves in two minutes. We need to get to
platform A. It kind of looks
like he isn't here. Okay, well, I think we need
to get to platform A, though. 'Cause that's his only way out. Well, according to this,
we passed over him. He's gotta be on platform A. He's gotta be on
platform A, Sam. It's platform A. Platform A? (camera snap) Please look straight ahead. I don't see him.
I don't see him anywhere. That's platform A. Where is he? Is he up there? I'm gonna check up here. It shows him right here. Is he hiding
in this parking lot? I mean, this is the exact
location where it shows him. Your photos are printing. Please collect them
outside the shade. Thank you.
We'll see you soon. Oh, wait. Okay. There's my photos. He's gotta be
hiding somewhere out here. It shows him right here. I think we need to
search elsewhere. I think we need to go down. Yeah. I mean,
tracker accuracy, it's— I mean, it's giving us
a really accurate position. It's giving us
an accurate, live... But like, right here. I don't hear any
frantic sounding boys yet. Maybe we need to
see if there's a basement level or something? Yeah, I don't know. Or maybe we need
to check the shops. Two minutes.
In one minute... In one minute, then I'm
gonna run for the train. Okay, okay, here I go. (softly)
I don't see them. And they would... probably be
frantically running up and down this train... if they were looking for me. (heavy inhale) Okay, we're leaving. I still don't see 'em. I think I
might have... phew... Think I might have made it. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
No. No. No. What could he have taken? How did he—
No way. What did he get on? What just left? How is that possible? You checked the
Nancy train, right? I thought I checked it. It left five minutes ago. Yeah. What was after that? He is on a train...! (exhausted chuckling) (whispering)
Let's goooo! How did he pull that off? What, where—
Oh my god. What other trains were there? I don't even know.
I'm trying to figure it out. I really don't understand. We should have played
more defense on the trains. We should have just
stood on platforms. Make sure he couldn't
get on anything. Well, I mean... the Nancy one I thought
was the only option. Okay.
I saw a regional line. I'm gonna put this here,
and you can stand. My arm's tired. I saw, I saw, I saw—
It went— I'll find where it went. No, I agree.
I also saw that. Verdun, or something. No, but that goes north.
The train to Verdun leaves to the north.
I checked that. There are no trains from here that go the direction he's going. What track is he on? I can't even figure that out. He's on the track
that goes to Paris. I think he's
galaxybraining it, and he's gonna get
back to his territory through Paris or
something, I don't know. This doesn't make any sense. And I haven't
seen him stop yet. This doesn't
make any sense at all. A lot of his moves
have not made sense. Whoa. I just realized
a really good idea. I could put my mic
on my hat. Okay, this... This has to be it. Let me look. Yup. 2:06. That's it.
(shudders) We can't get there until... We might have to go to Paris
and then go the other way. The fastest way to
get there is through Paris. Getting there at 6 pm. That is—
That is what he took. How did we miss that? I guess we couldn't
find it because there's... There's so few of them.
There's one every four hours. Well, why couldn't
we find it on here? Yeah, 'cause I think we were
looking at the departures soon. And there's only one
every couple hours, so... That's 100%
what he's doing. Okay. So... Hey, my sandwich.
Sorry. Okay, well, they're
not on this train. So I can get to Bar-le-Duc... without getting caught. I don't think Adam's
gonna be able to get back into his
territory in time. Maybe he'll think of something if they catch me, but... We might have just been GG'd. (trills lips)
I mean... I mean, I genuinely don't know if there's anything we could do. Maybe not. So, I mean, I think
at the very least, it makes sense to
head down to Nancy. Okay, let's go to Nancy. It appears Ben has stopped. Well, there's
actually quite good trains from Nancy to where Ben is. They're only an hour. Yeah?
And there's one in— When are we gonna
get into Nancy? I think 3:50-ish, maybe? 3:50? Around then, I don't know. Ah, shoot.
There's one at 3:35. Oh, no, we're
not gonna make that. Alright! Bienvenue à... ...Bar-le-Duc. So, we are now in my territory. And there are about
five hours left in the game. And Bar-le-Duc is
pretty good, to be honest. There are not a lot of
trains that go here. We're pretty in the
middle of nowhere. When Sam and Adam
do catch up to me... Adam won't have any options. So... I'm kinda gonna
just wander around and see Bar-le-Duc. Let's take a little tour. Is that a statue of
Leon Trotsky? No, okay. Okay, so Ben is in ""Bar-de-Luc"". We can seemingly get
a transfer there. Yeah, we can—
From Nancy. We can get there from Nancy. We would arrive around 5:40. Maybe there's enough time? He is... He is trapped there.
Pretty much. He has no trains
to get out of there that don't just go
back towards Nancy. Yeah. So, we are gonna
be able to tag him. The question is just: can I get back into my region? We are not far from my region. I don't think I have a shot.
I could have— No, I don't think you do. Yep. Yep, okay. Welcome to Nancy. Well, good news, bad news. Bad news is that
the hourly trains to ""Bar-de-Luc"" leave four minutes ago. Good news, we have
56 minutes here, where we can just
check things out. We're sure
there's no faster way? Assuming Google is right. Next train to ""Bar-de-Luc""? 4:34. Okay. ♪ Bar-le-doo-doot-
dooo-do-doot-doo-Duc ♪ ♪ Bar-le-doo-doot-
dooo-do-doot-doo-Duc ♪ ♪ Bar-le-doo-doot-
dooo-do-doot-doo-Duc ♪ ♪ Bar-le-Duc ♪ Yeah, there's a
little river here. That's pretty pretty. I'm gonna sit by the river. (exhausted groan) Well... There have been
several times on my run where I thought that I had a sense of where
Adam and Sam are, but... At this point,
I really gotta say, I don't know where they are. Seemingly... they got themselves in a
mess of trouble, somehow. I think they
would have caught me... were it not for
something unforeseen. But that's...
how the cookie crumbles. Oh, I would love a cookie. Well, welcome to Nancy. Thank you. I'm glad to be here in... Well, I was gonna say
I'm glad to be here in Nancy. But frankly,
I would much rather be in ""Bar-de-Luc"". Yeah. Well, I mean,
in a more real sense, I would rather be
in my region after catching him
in Luxembourg. To get swerved twice in a row... Yeah, that's tough stuff. We spent all that time
on the parking deck. I mean, it showed
him right there! It's gonna look real
embarrassing in the edit. It's not gonna be
one of our finest moments. No. Well, this is very pretty. Look at that. Look at that.
What? Look at that.
Look at that. Look at what?
Look at that. Look at that. Oh, just look at
things in general? Look at that. Look at that.
Are you calling me 'that'? Feels rude. Yeah. Look at that.
Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that.
Look at that. Look at that.
That's pretty... That's pretty slay. That's pretty... epic win. Right, guys? Should probably
go back kind of this way towards the station. So... We're about
10 minutes away from Ben. But it's 5:20. How are your
options looking, Adam? Quite bad. Okay, hello. So, after looking at
all of the arrivals and all of the departures going into ""Bar-de-Luc"", at this point,
there is no way... There is mathematically no way that Adam could get
to his win area by the end of today. So... I don't have to go anywhere. I just have to sit
on this bench and take in the view and wait for Sam and Adam
to get here, I guess. Let's see when they show up. Last train, probably. Welcome to Bar-le-Duc. A place that I'm sure the camera is intimately
acquainted with by now. Yeah, Ben's
been here for a while. Yep. Okay. Oh, very pretty looking. Ben seems to be
waiting somewhere this way. I like the things on the hill. It's very pretty here. Look at that! I don't think we
need to really worry about sneaking up on him. Nah, I don't think there's too much of a rush.
He doesn't seem very concerned. This has been quite the
roundabout tour of Europe to end up... approximately 125 kilometers, less than 100 miles away
from where we started. Yeah, we... We took the scenic route. Look who it is. There he is! He's not running. No, and I don't think
he probably needs to. (high-five clap) It's a nice little
spot you got here. Seems like that's that. Well, Ben, as I imagine
you have figured out... I cannot get into my
region before 8 pm. No. (sigh) Which means... you are the winner
of Jet Lag season 7. Yaaay! I didn't think it would happen, but then it did. Ben... I have something for you. Is it the trophy?
But it's not in there. Oh. It was under here all along?! The trophy was
inside you all along! Oh my god.
Oh my god. It's on top of my head? Yeah, but now it fell
into your lap just now. Oh, it fell in my lap just now?
Yeah! Sam! That was a good game, Ben. I mean, you earned that win. There were some
very tight moments. Evading us
two different times. I was wondering... I was sure there must have
been some close calls, but I couldn't tell exactly. You couldn't tell where?
Wait, wait, wait. I had some
guesses as to where— Wait, wait, wait.
Where did you— Wait, in Luxembourg?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Where did you think
there were close calls? Well, cause there was a weird— There was some thing
where I got Ratatouille'd. Where I was like,
I'm gonna make it look like I'm going back to Luxembourg, but then actually I'm gonna
get on another train. Wait, you don't know!
That is amazing. That is amazing.
What happened? Oh my god, Ben!
(guttural chuckling) The train that you were headed
on back up to Luxembourg? Ohh.
Yeah. That you got off? We got on that
train at the station that you got off.
That you got off. What? We assumed you saw us. No. (Sam and Adam laugh) Well, here's the thing. We thought— We couldn't believe that
you had managed to see us! You could have made that
transfer one station before. Yeah, why didn't
you just get off earlier? I don't know. (giggles)
(sobs) I mean, you
anticipated our move. We were there for
ten minutes looking for you before you got on
the train to here. I wasn't sure. I was hiding in a photo booth. (wheezes) You wanna see—
Wait, in fact— I bet that we have
footage of the photo booth, 'cause we—
(laughs) Was it on platform one?
I took this— Well no, it was down in
the station a little bit. What an incredible run. I can't believe
the photo booth thing actually did something.
That's crazy. We were there! Ben, you've just won season seven
of Jet Lag: The Game. How do you feel? And you've been on
a lot of trains. I do genuinely feel...
jet lagged. (all cheering) Good bye!
See you in season eight! See you in season eight! Bye, folks.
Thanks for watching. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Thank you so much for watching
this entire season of Jet Lag. And congrats, Ben! You did it, Ben! I did it. I did it.

off-season with no gaps... sign up for Nebula. Another way that
you could keep jet lagging is you could go and
watch Crime Spree which is the pilot
season of Jet Lag. And it's available
exclusively on Nebula. It's not even on YouTube! That season, Sam had to go
around the United States breaking a bunch of weird laws. And we also had
not figured out that we should have
rest periods yet. So you can see what the
consequences of that was. You can see me react—
Kotaku called it janky. Kotaku did call it janky. You can see me reacting to bringing the most embarrassing
possible items through TSA. Oh yeah.
Oh yeah! And the TSA agent knowing
what I was bringing through. Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
'Cause it comes on the X-ray. Anyways. There's a law in Texas,
you'll find out about it. Yeah, anyways. Nebula, you know, it really is a great way

That's not that much latte! Yeah, that's, yeah,
you can't even add those and get to a full latte.
I think it'll be fun. Anybody that watched all
the ad reads for this season will understand this bit. And if you didn't, then
you'll be totally lost. Yeah. Well, you see,
it started at one half, but we've had inflation. (laughs)

to episode 5 of our 72-hour game of tag, where each of us
is trying to get to a different location in Europe before the other two
can tag them. Right now, Ben's on his
way to Zermatt, Switzerland with a huge lead, thanks to a series of
escalating setbacks for the Chasers. See, as Ben made his way
through the Netherlands, we wanted to go
directly to Breda, a hub where we
could cut him off, but a signal fault forced us
to go a much longer route. Once finally in Breda,
Ben was headed to Belgium. We wanted to take a
train to Brussels, but discovered it made
its first stop at 8:01, one minute after the
rest period begins, meaning we weren't
allowed to get on it. So instead, we figured
we'd go up to Rotterdam and take a high-speed train
to Brussels in the morning. But then it turned out
that train was sold out. So we have to wait
to take a train when the game starts at
6 am tomorrow morning. But this small train station
doesn't have a train to Brussels until 7 am the next morning. All of which is how
Ben's 15-minute lead just turned into a
3 hour lead. And as you can tell, we aren't feeling
amazing about it. This just seems impossible
that it could be this bad. So now we get
to Brussels at 9 am? Yes. Three hours
after the game starts? Yes. (grunt) There's gotta be... That can't be right! Okay, let's... Okay. (softly)
Off to Belgium, then. I didn't really think
I'd get this far, so I'm feeling pretty good. I am going to get to
the Brussels Airport by the rest period. I'll be able to start from
there tomorrow morning. When will Sam and Adam
be able to get there? Who knows? They know, probably. Is there a bus or something? I'm— I don't think so. Is there a place that
we could take a taxi to that would be useful? I don't think so. Are we sure, though? Stick with me for a second here. ...No. There's gotta be something. My god, how is this possible? I don't think he's
taking the news well. (dejected sigh) We could go get some dinner. Are we sure we've
exhausted all of our options? I mean... Wait, wait, let me look. Okay, what if
we tried to go to Roosendaal and Antwerp in the morning,
potentially? We could. Okay, I'm just... Just for starters,
we could do that. Also, we could take a
29-minute car to Brecht. Okay, yes. Brecht is even better. Yeah, see, look. Brecht to Brussels
tomorrow morning, 6 am. We get there at 7:36, look. I think that checks out. Okay, so there's
a lot going on here, so let's walk you through it. Basically,
what Adam figured out is that the Chasers
can use our ability to take
30-minute taxi rides to go to a place
called Brecht tonight. Brecht just so happens
to have a train right when the game starts
next morning, to Antwerp, where we can then make a
quick connection to Brussels. In total, this one
little move will save us a whole 90 minutes. Which is why... We need to get in
a taxi to Brecht right now. So we hopped in an Uber and made it to the station just in time
for the rest period. Alright, we are at
Noorderkempen, and we have reached
the end of day two. Good night. Good night,
see you in the morning! Meanwhile, Ben made
it to Brussels Airport. Coincidentally,
the exact location where we ended
day two last season. We are here at
the Brussels Airport. Someone on my train
got arrested for smelling a lady's hair, so that's kind of interesting. Anyway, what is my plan? What's the plan?
What is the plan? Great question.
Here's Ben's plan: Luxembourg. It's in his win region, and he has a lot of
options from there. He's hoping to chain together
a few trains to get there, with stops in
Charleroi and Namur. But first, it's time to sleep. Okay, good night. (smooch) So yada yada yada,
rest period, and it's 6 am the next morning. Ben gets on his train
to Charleroi, we go to Antwerp,
and just like that, the chase is back on. Okay, so, headed to Brussels, but I think that's on... I think it's
literally right there. Literally this platform. Welcome to Antwerp. It's a very cool train station. We should go up.
Look at that. Let's go up a level.
Let's go look at it. I feel like this
is one of those things that somebody would
frame up really neatly in one of those
really annoying, accidentally
Wes Anderson-like videos. Yeah. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Okay, say something
in sort of a detached tone. Sitting on trains for two days wreaks havoc on your bowels. I'm feeling good this morning. I mean physically, terrible. I am on the brink of death. But game-wise? Feeling pretty good. If I can get all the way
to Luxembourg, my options really open up, and then I should be able
to just embed myself somewhere weird
in my territory. 'Cause I think at this rate... No one's gonna make it
to their end location. I think the winner is
gonna be determined by where the Runner is
at the end of today, at 8 pm today. Just a quick reminder: if nobody makes it to
their end location, the win goes to
whoever's end location is closest to the current Runner
at the end of three days. This is day three, meaning
that whoever's win region the Runner is in
at 8 pm today will win the game. But that just means
that I have to get somewhere weird
in my territory where they can't get to me. And I feel like I should
be able to do that. But... We'll see. Okay... hello.
Okay. So... Ben has left Brussels.
He is headed, it seems, to a place called
Charleroi[shar-la-roy]. Charleroi[cha-ta-rha]. He will get there at 7:30. Luckily, the train
we are on to Brussels continues on to, what is it? Charleroi[cha-ta-rha].
Yeah. And we'll get there at 8:30. So, we'll only be
an hour behind him. That's good. We frankly have no idea... where he's going. I mean, he seems to be probably planning to chain
together regional lines to make his way
into his territory, which to be fair is
a very smart move. You can't cut somebody off if you don't know
where they're going. So... I think we just gotta
follow him for now. We're doing fine. We're doing fiiine. I had a dream last night that Sam and Adam fell down
a well, and I won. And when I went home,
there was a parade... for me. And people were in the streets, they were crying...
tears of joy. They were weeping. And Joe Biden was there, and he kissed me
on the forehead. And he gave me a big... key to the city. And Sam and Adam were
still down in the well. Was it a dream or
was it a premonition? Only time will tell. Okay. We are here in Charleroi. I have about 15 minutes to transfer onto
a train to Namur. There's my train. Okay. Off to Namur. We have news. He's going to Namur. Which... we thought he might do, and... We could've gotten off
in Brussels and gone straight to Namur, and gained a
lot of ground on him. But we didn't,
we didn't do that. He has a lot of options
from Namur. Well, most notably, he has a direct to
Luxembourg. It would be cool
to go to Luxembourg. I mean, I would
enjoy going to Luxembourg. Yeah, we can take the 8:50.
So we can take the 8:50 and just be one hour behind. At a certain point,
we can't be one hour behind, though. Yes, at a certain point,
we do have to catch up. So, here's the situation. The situation is...
interesting. The situation is entertaining. It's good, suspenseful
entertainment. And that's what we're
here for, right? This train to Namur
gets in at 8:22. There is then a train
to Luxembourg at 8:47. Which I don't have
remotely enough... ...coins to take yet. If I can earn... a whole bunch of coins
in 25 minutes and get on that 8:47... that means that I will
have bought myself... I think at least a
two-hour lead in Luxembourg, which would be amazing. And if I don't make
that train, it means I'll probably
get caught in Namur. So... I've just
gotta pull a card as soon as I get off
this train, and... ...pray. Pray that it's something
I can do really quickly. Okay, okay, we're in Namur. The train for Luxembourg
leaves in 25 minutes. So, let's pull a card. Okay, I'm using the
last of my coins to... double this next card. And... I guess
the fate of my run and the fate of this game... sort of come down
to what card I pull. Okay... here we go. Become a French chef. Become a French chef. Make mayonnaise. You must successfully
emulsify egg and oil into at least one
tablespoon of mayonnaise. That's gonna be
hard to do in 25 minutes. (chuckles) Oh god. Ohh. Oh, the legs are burnin'. Oh, da legs are burnin'. There's a place called
Shop & Go over there. Oh, okay, eggs. Oil, oil, oil. Some kind of oil. Can I get oil out of
something else? Vinaigrettes. Yeah, there's oil at
the bottom of this. That might
(bleep) me up, but... I have no choice. Merci. Now I just have to emulsify. I just have to emulsify. Welcome to
The French Chef. Today we're going to
be making mayonnaise. Crack an egg into here. We're gonna get some oil. Yes. And then... we're gonna be
extremely... vigorous about this. Egh. (breathing heavily) It's mostly paper
right now. We're gonna pour
this out and try again. Egg. The oil. Hello, alright. We are in Charleroi. Ben is in Namur now. We remain an hour behind him. Basically... We need something to change. We need something to happen that slows Ben down
in some way. Yeah, there doesn't
seem to be much that we can really do... to get ahead of Ben.
To get ahead of him. It seems mostly down to... hopefully something
messing up on his side. So, hopefully,
we're cutting to him vetoing a challenge, or not... Falling in a ditch. Yeah, or not
having enough coins. Or dying. No. Of embarrassment,
'cause he does bad. Yes.
Yeah! Oh, okay. It spilled out. Oh dear. This is bad. This is bad. Okay, we're gonna... They're looking at me. We're gonna throw this out. Okay. Found a cup in the trash. We're gonna try again. Egg. Oil. The train's leaving soon. (panting) Okay. Okay, okay. I think that that is
sufficiently emulsified. It's completely mixed. So... Oh, we're gonna throw
all of this out. Okay. I'm cleaning off
the rest of the egg. Ugh. Ugh. Eh (bleep), oh ew. Ugh. Ugh. Oh, I don't know how
much time I have! I don't know
what time it is. Ugh! Ohh. Okay, okay. Oh, it's still here. Pardonne. Merci. That's my train to Luxembourg! Looks like you didn't
make it in time, boys! We're going to a new country. The train to Luxembourg
leaves in three minutes, and he is in the station. I do think he's gonna
go to Luxembourg. Which I don't love. I don't love that. Things aren't going great. (sigh) I'm gonna touch that wire. Yeah, I think
you should touch it. It seems to not— I don't think that's
electrical. (strained grunts) Couldn't get there. (bleep) yeah.
Touched the wire. Nice. Let's get on the train. Ohh. (panting) I think we're leaving. Yeah. Yeah, we're leaving. Okay, let's freaking go. I have to finish washing
off all my stuff. Oh, we gotta wash
the camera too. Okay, let's go find a seat. Looks all historic and stuff.
Oh, there he goes. Okay. Alright, well... I'm trying not to
freak out yet... but it does seem like he's
going to enter his win area now. And it doesn't seem like we
have a good way of catching up. (silly grumbles) I agree. Alright, well... Welcome to Namur Station, where you just saw Ben.
Thank you. I was talking to the audience. Not you. Rude. Ben left,
what, 18 minutes ago? But now we have to
wait a half hour to get on a train. So... Welcome to Namur. It's a beautiful city full
of construction mostly. Okay, so it is 9:48, and Adam just
tweeted something. And that suggests to me that they just got on a train. Because usually
what I do is I'll sit down on a train,
a long train, and I'll pull up my phone
and pull up Twitter. And that would make sense because there was a train
one minute ago... from Namur to Arlon. And if they got on
that train, they could get to
Luxembourg by 11:50. So I'm gonna assume that
that's what they're doing. And so I just have to get out
of Luxembourg before then. I think that
should be no problem. Welcome to Luxembourg! One of the toddlers
in my car said, ""We're in Germany–France!"" And what is Luxembourg,
if not Germany–France? It seems like most of the routes
I would take out of here go through a place called Metz. Already have enough
budget to get there. So I think what
we're gonna do is we're just gonna...
pull a card see what the deal is, and then hop on
a train to Metz. Sam... Ben is officially
in the region where – were the game
to end right now – he would win. Okay, he could get to Metz
on this train at 12:12. (chuckles increasingly)
That's way— That's a lot earlier
than we could. When could we get to Metz? I mean, we're not even
getting to Arlon until 11:30, and then we would need
to take the train, and then we would
need to take a taxi, and then we would
need to take a slow regional train
to Metz. Okay... If Ben gets on a train 14 minutes from now,
headed south, then the game is potentially— Okay. If there— If Ben gets
on the train at 11:24... We are well and truly
(bleep)-ed. Let's give them
a little shuffle, and then we will see
what we're doing next. Cursed! You are now being
Ratatouille'd. The next move you make
will be decided by a rat. Please access the
Smithsonian Zoo's naked mole rat live feed
and go to Camera 2. Whatever direction you first
see a rat cross the camera, you must travel
at least 2 miles in that direction
before continuing. Okay, I have to access
the naked mole rat cam. And they're gonna decide
where I'm gonna go next. I have to access Cam 2. Okay, so that rat
just went that way. So I have to go west. Is Metz at least
two miles west? No. No, it is not. So let's look at
the departure board and figure out what
we're allowed to take. Oh, okay, well, it's 11:25. Yeah.
And he's still there. I feel like I'm just kinda setting myself up
for heartbreak here. Probably. Ugghhh... I've got a real— I've got a pit
in my stomach. He's— It still says
he's in the station. Yeah. But why would— There's no reason he
would be in the station if he wasn't taking that train. There's not another
train for ten minutes. Wasserbillig. What about Trier? That's in Germany. That's not where
we want to go. Pétange, that sounds French. It's in Luxembourg, but
it is the right way. Okay. I think that's our
best bet for now. It's Pétange. Maybe the rat is helping me. Maybe this is actually gonna
make their lives harder. Okay, it's 11:30. Yeah. It doesn't
show him having left. I think he didn't take it. That seems conclusive. 'Cause it seems to be
roughly live location. Okay, he definitely
did not take the train. Yeah.
Wow. That is a massive relief. Pétange. It's interesting. I mean, I never considered
going to Pétange, but... This rat's... This rat's got an
interesting strat, because the rat was
like, just go west. You know? Don't worry about
Sam's win area. Adam's going next. All you gotta
worry about is him. As long as you're going
away from his win area, it's gonna make it harder
for him to get back by the end of the day. You've totally got a
good chance of winning, even if you get caught. I'm gonna trust
the rat on this one. I mean, I have to trust
the rat on this one. That's the challenge, but... Let's just hope
the rat's right. Where is he? West. What? None of this makes any sense. I think he's on that
line that does that curved... Oh, he's on the curvy line. But that means
he's going to there. Yeah. Well, we could even maybe just take a taxi
or something. Luxembourg is so small. Alright, well,
now I think Ben's... I've gone from being worried Ben was about to
run away with it, to thinking Ben's actually
in quite a lot of trouble. Alright, I've decided I'm actually gonna
get off a little earlier. I've gone my two miles.
I've fulfilled my curse. That rat doesn't know
what it's talking about. I think that I have to
go back to Bettembourg, and then down back to Metz. It seems like I'm
going to just get trapped if I... go to... all the way to Pétange. 'Cause there are just not a
lot of trains out of there. Hopefully, I'm hoping that... me being kind of indecisive
and going all around and having a rat factor
into the equation... will throw them off enough that they won't be able to
stay right on top of me. If they're even right on
top of me, I don't know. It's a very
nice train station. I just can't even
figure out where he's going. Cause he's in... Esch-sur-Alzette.
He's in Esch-sur-Alzette. We could take a
20-minute taxi there. I mean, if we
were to take a taxi, we might as well take it now, but the problem is then
we're... potentially... In a place that
there's (bleep) nothing. Yeah. We might be
stranding ourselves. Oh wait, no.
There is a train to there in... Oh, it leaves in two minutes. Wait, what? Yeah, Luxembourg to
Esch-sur—(indistinct) Oh, okay. What train is it, Sam? It leaves in two minutes,
so 12:17? The Wasserbillig one? No, it's the one to Rodange. Rodange? 5AB to Rodange, great. So it's up here.
Wait, I don't— what? But that's a different departure
time than it shows here. Well, I don't know.
That's what it says. 5AB to Rodange.
This is 5AB. Well, yeah, but
does it stop at the... Oh, yes, it does stop. Oh, that says out of order. ""Destination: Rodange."" Yeah. Okay, the door closed on me. Let's do it. Now it shows him... north of that. Is he headed back towards us? Yeah, because it
seems like he's just on the same line coming back. (whispering)
Jesus Christ. What is he doing? Okay, so I'm actually
going to take this train all the way up to Howald, and then I only have to
be there for ten minutes before I can transfer
on a train down to Metz. Hopefully in that ten minutes, they don't realize
what I'm doing. My hope is that they
think I'm going back up to Luxembourg Station. And since I'm getting
one station from there, and I'm only there
for ten minutes, hopefully they don't realize
that I stop in Howald and then go back down. And then hopefully by the time that I'm on that train
back down... it's too late. Yeah, so I guess if we were
to go all the way to Bettembourg, he might jump us on the tracks. It's possible. I mean, he left just a
couple minutes before us. Yeah. I mean, he's closer to
Bettembourg now than we are. Which means maybe we're going to get off at
this next stop here, so he doesn't jump us. We need to decide now. Let's get off.
Yeah, I think so. Okay, he's definitely
coming north. He is? Okay. So, search is on. Okay, okay. So we have to get on
the train and find him. The key is, I think we want— There's a high chance
he's trying to get off at the Luxembourg
Central Station. So we need to catch
him before that. Oh, it's double decker. Uh-oh. Double decker's tough.
What if— Here, I'll take the top floor. You take the bottom floor, okay? Which direction do we go? Let's start at the back. And go to the front. Well, we need to
expose ourselves right now. What? Oh, we're basically
at the front. Okay. I'll take the top,
you take the bottom. Alright, well...
Nothing? He left. He left? Oh my god,
did he get off? What if he saw us? There's no way he got off. Is that the station though? That's the station.
That's the station. If he got off, then that's
one of the biggest... gamer moves we've ever seen. Okay, I'm here in Howald. Hopefully they don't realize
that I'm actually stopped here. (sharp inhale) Fingers crossed. He's not on the train. He must have gotten off. Definitely, he's still there,
and it's showing live. We just got swerved. Caption+ by JS*

to episode four of our game of
Tag Across Europe. Near the end of last episode, Ben and I managed to tag Adam
in Emden, Germany, only one ferry ride away from
his end location in Borkum. That means that
I'm the Runner now, and I'm hoping to make it
all the way over here to Jersey, UK. So far, I've spent
half of my budget getting to Salzbergen, where my plan is to head
through the Netherlands, back to Paris,
and go from there. But my next move might not be
as predictable as I had hoped, because I just drew
the Ratatouille Curse. If I don't veto it,
the direction I travel in next will be decided, at random, by the naked mole rats
at the Smithsonian, possibly sending me straight
back towards the Chasers. But if I do veto it,
it means trudging forward into the Netherlands with
hardly any budget left. So what do I do? Mmm, do I veto this? Oh, I need to decide fast. Okay, so basically
it's a 1-in-4 chance that I get the west
direction that I need. I'm looking for scooter
rentals or something, but I don't see any. Grrr! Okay, so here's the problem. North, I go right back to them. East, there's no trains. South, there's a train that
could take me one stop south, but there's no train
that I could make before they would get to
that next stop to the south. So, basically, with a
3-out-of-4 chance of getting caught if I accept this curse... I think I've got to veto it and just wait for this train and hope that I can
do another challenge on my next connection. That sucks. Well... I don't think I'm gonna be
in Salzbergen again, so... may as well
look around. Jeez, look at the
size of this thing. This is very cool. Let's go look at this church. It looks... historic. The advantage of walking
around is that hopefully we'll make them think that
I'm doing a challenge. We want them to lose
confidence, I guess. I don't really know why,
but it seems like a good idea. We should not be operating
from a place of fear. No. 'Cause he's the one
that is in a bind. Right, not us. Wait, was that, that
seemed like a real glitch. There were
two identical men wearing identical clothes
who had bikes. Let's see if we can get this. I think that's
just what Germany is. No, no, no.
No, no, no, look. There's one. Those are the same man. They're the exact same. Those are identical men.
They're identical men. We're gonna blur their faces. We're gonna blur their faces,
but that's going in the video. Those are the same man. Here we go. You can tell we're
in the Netherlands, because there's
already bike paths. They are the same man. Look, they are the same man.
That is the same man. And they're gonna sit
next to each other. Maybe they're best friends. I think that that's a cool way
to find your best friend. Yeah. Everyone's best friend is just
whoever looks the most like them. Yeah.
That's the system. Actually, everyone I've
ever met who looks like me, I have hated. Ohh, there we go. Welcome to Salzbergen. It's so hot here.
Yeah. How did it get so much hotter? What I would like to do
is go inside of a building. But, oh, there is a building. Okay, good. This is probably my... biggest incentive
to make it south. Okay, now I'm arriving
in Hengelo. The train I need
to take out of Hengelo leaves in 19 minutes. So if I want to earn
any budget here, I need to do it before
that train leaves. If I miss it,
Ben and Adam will arrive before I have
a chance to escape. Alright, next train
is at 1:46. Name of the game:
don't miss that train. Second name of the game:
pull a challenge. Third name of the game:
complete that challenge. Fourth name of the game... Hydrate. Okay. Shuffle, shuffle. Shuffle, shuffle. Okay, we're pulling this card. Find the town hall. You have 30 minutes to find the town hall of
wherever you are without consulting your phone
or asking anyone for help. If the building you
assert to be the town hall is not the town hall, you automatically veto
the challenge. If you fail to find the
town hall within 30 minutes, you automatically veto
the challenge. Oh my god, we gotta go. We gotta go, we gotta go. We gotta go. We only have 19 minutes,
because... because... we have a train to catch. Alright, let's try
to find a map. The German train stations
definitely had maps. No map. There's a map. I found a map.
I found a map. Found a map.
Found a map. Oh my god.
There's a map. Oh, this is great! Oh, no, this isn't very helpful. (groan) Here in Salzbergen. We still have to just
hang out here for a half hour. I'm so excited to go
to the Netherlands. I've never been. I imagine it will
look a lot like this. Well, it is funny
when you look at Europe, especially this area
of Europe, it's like: There's France,
and it's so big. And then there's Germany,
and it's so big. And then there's just Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg. It's all kind of
the same thing, though. They're not going to like
that I said that. I would not say that
all of them are the same thing. I feel like
there have been many... sort of very notable conflicts about how they're
not the same thing. Yeah, but my assessment
is that they were kind of... going a little overboard
with that. Okay, so we're there. But there's no buildings marked. I've gotta assume it's nearby. I like the look of that
kind of square thing. I'm gonna start
looking over there-ish. (anxious snickering) I'm pretty sure
I suggested this challenge, and I regret it already. Town halls in
European cities tend to be in the most prominent
center kinda square. At least that's my
experience with... other European countries. Because it's all
kind of, they're just, they like their
little chocolates. You think the people
who didn't want it all to be one thing
went overboard? I think... 'Cause think
about who did want it to be all one thing
and who didn't. A man by the
name of Jesus Christ (wheezes) ...wanted us to
come together as one. We hate Nazis. Disclaimer. This feels... This feels central. Ooh. That kinda feels
pretty central. Look at that church and the
other tower in the background. I want to go over there. I'm really running out of time. This is not great. Okay, I'm liking this. Okay, well that's,
you know, definitely a church. However, that tower, I'm not sure if it's a church. It doesn't really seem to have
any religious symbols on it. Yeah, this building is interesting. It has bells. I think I see offices. It's got flags.
It's got flags. It's got the EU flag. Ohh. Come on. Just haven't seen a sign on it. We're really running out of time. There's just gotta be
a sign on it somewhere, right? Okay. If I'm
gonna make that train... I have to call it. I don't see a sign. I'm gonna declare it. I declare that
my assumed city hall. Now let's see. Yep, that was it. Okay, okay, we gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. Train leaves in five minutes. I gotta carefully run a bit, which I'm probably
gonna regret later. Let's goooo! Let's go on a little walk. It's so hot though. Yeah, I know, get over it. We could go
to the Flohmarkt. Oh my gosh, the Floh— They really want you to go. Oh, see, here we go.
Here's the little downtown. Quick, Ben, say
something really funny, 'cause this shot is pretty. We can use it. Bing-bong. Okay, almost back. We got this. Leaves in two minutes. Platform 2A. Two... One... Is this it? Zutphen. (bleep) yes. Adam, what's the update? What's the Sam status? Ben, he has left Hengelo, and he is on his way
to Zutphen. So he continues on... his basically
one-hour lead on us. Yeah, okay, it says Hengelo. So I certainly don't
want to panic, by any means. But I will say... Sam is making progress. It is— He is reaching the point of
meaningful-ish progress. We'll see. I mean, all we can
really do right now is... stay right behind him. Yep, it's true. And... It's true. If something devious comes up, we can try and jump him. Yeah. Oh, look, look. We're in the Netherlands, Ben. This is the Dutch countryside. It looks...
We're in Holland. ...freaking crazy out here. They've got a factory. And trees. That house.
House. It's exactly the way
I always dreamed it would be! This is my Netherlands. Welcome to Zutphen. Okay, so I got about 30 minutes
until my next safe train. The one that, you know... The next one
that they can't make. Or rather, my last safe train. But I don't have the
budget for that anyway, so I need to do a
challenge either way. So I think I might as well
buy the double-up powerup, because if I don't
complete this challenge and I have to veto it, I'm pretty much caught
here either way. Yeah, let's buy it. Lock it in. (pff) That's the lock it in,
I don't know, graphic or... Damn it. Okay. Final shuffle. (sigh) Come on. See something old. You have 30 minutes to find
the oldest thing you can. You must be able to verify
the thing's age within 50 years. Your reward is the
age of your old thing, up to 2,000 coins. This is great. This is no risk. Okay, we gotta go. I see an old tower thing there. I'm gonna go walk towards that.
That seems like a good start. Welcome to the
Netherlands, Adam. Thank you! It's 2:29, and he's
still in Zutphen. So I think that means
he had to stop in Zutphen for a challenge,
which is great, cause that means
we'll gain a half hour. We're about to hop
on a train to Zutphen. So you better hurry up, Sam, or we're gonna getcha. So it seems like we came to
a great spot for this challenge. There is a church from the
11th century in this town, but the problem is that we have to verify the
thing's age within 50 years. All the references just
say ""11th century"". Nobody seems really sure about
its origin date beyond that. There's also the oldest
public library in the world right here in this town,
which is crazy. But, I wasn't able to find
a date super quickly on that, so I'm gonna go to
this church for now... which seems like a good one
that does have specific dates. Look at this. Gorgeous. It's pretty old looking. Alright, I'm going to try
to get a specific date. Okay, so this is
officially Broederenkerk. And it was built,
according to this website, between 1307 and 1308. It seems like there might be slightly better options
in this town, but the train I want to
take is in 15 minutes. And I can't really verify
any other ones quickly, and the station is
5-10 minutes away, so I think I'm going
to lock this in. That was lucky. Alright, let's get
back to the station. Is that us?
That's our train. Let's go get on it. It looks like he's headed
back towards the station. So, I think he is going
to take a train at 2:58. Then, if we do
get in at 3:23, we can get on a train
in 5 minutes, headed to where he's headed. It's not a lot of time, Sam. That's not a lot of margin! A lot of things, Sam! Back at the station. Alright, we're gonna head
almost two hours south to Breda. From there, there's one more
train to get me to Brussels, which would be awesome. But to be honest, I'm not
sure if I have a safe— a kind of mathematically
safe option out of Breda. I'll do a bunch of
research on the train. That might be where
today's journey ends. But if Ben continues
to track south, which makes sense,
that would be great. 'Cause then if we can
shut down Adam's quickly, I can get another run and seal the deal,
I think, tomorrow. Okay. We are in Zutphen. Welcome to Zutphen. Sam left here not long ago. Yeah, he left here
about 20 minutes ago, 25. And we have a train
in 10 minutes. So we're going to be
35 minutes behind Sam now, which I think is pretty good. That's still better. I mean, it's...
Pretty good. It does not give him
a lot of margin. It's a pretty
straightforward chase here. Yeah, we're just
chasing after him. Which he's evading. Okay, so...
I've done my research. In Breda, I get in at 4:40. There is a train to
Brussels leaving at 4:42. So, if I can make that transfer, I can make it all
the way to Brussels with the budget I have, safely. If I miss that transfer, I don't think I have
another good option. I'll probably
get caught in Breda. But yeah,
we'll just have to see if we can make that
two-minute transfer. Let's hope it's just across
the platform or something. That'd be awesome. Alright, off to Breda. Or wherever he stops,
if he stops earlier. I think these are the nicest
train seats we've had. Like movie theater seats. I feel like
I'm gonna see a movie. I'm gonna see a movie
of what it looks like... of everything between
Zutphen and Breda. Yeah, it's gonna
be an awesome movie. Okay, well... Everything was going great. I was j chillin, watchin the Formula 1 British
Grand Prix, which was great. And we stopped here, and
a big storm blew through. And now this train is cancelled. And I don't speak Dutch,
so that's the extent I know. All I know is that it's
not goin' more that way. Where am I, by the way? Okay, well the first letter
in where I am is an apostrophe, so I'm not really sure
how to pronounce that, but I'm gonna call
it Hertogensbosch... 's–Skert— 's–Serto—
Erto–gzenbosch. Adam, Adam. I do not like to wake you... But it appears that Sam
has gotten off the train at 's-Hertogenbosch. He's off the train
at Hertogenbosch? At apostrophe-S–
Hertogenbosch. I don't know why it
starts with an apostrophe. That's potentially
good news, maybe. Oh, we're quite close to there. Yes. Oh, great. We'll be in Hertogenbosch
in about 15 minutes. Okay, so the deal is
that there seems to be a signal switch issue somewhere
between here and Breda. The problem is that
Breda is where I need to go to transfer to Belgium. Or maybe I can get
to Eindhoven? Let's check.
That's to the south. There's a 4:50 to Eindhoven. It's in 21 minutes. I mean, there's
every chance that Ben and Adam
are right behind me. We're approaching
where he is. I think we have to
get off the train. What is this? Yeah, that's the
station where he's at. There's trains that keep
showing as cancelled. And I think, like our train, its future stops must've
been cancelled or something. It says,
""Eindpunt van deze trein"". That sounds like
""endpoint of this train."" ""Endpoint of this train."" There are no trains running between Tilburg and
""S-Verbagden"" due to a signal failure. Yeah, okay. And this says
terminus of this train, so this train is stopping here. That might be
why he's trapped. Maybe. Okay, well,
the sign says that... The sign says that seemingly, the signal issue is
between here and Tilburg, which is the next stop. That makes me worried that
Ben and Adam's train canceled, but only from here. Meaning they're
probably pulling up literally right now. It looks like
he's in the building. Mm-kay. I think he might have gotten
screwed by train cancellations. There's a lot of people.
Oh yeah, look at all these people. Yeah, I think all the
trains got cancelled. Oh, Sam. Oh, that sucks
for you, buddy. Alright. We have to be a little sneaky. Do you have him
on the tracker? Okay, this seems
to be the platform that Ben and Adam's
train would be at... if it existed. Which it doesn't seem to. Hopefully. It just shows
him on that platform. That train's not
gonna leave, is it? Ben, figure out where
this train's going, in case we need to
book tickets on it. Says his location is
literally right here. So he must—
I think he's above us. Should we not
go in and look? We would see him
through the window. Okay, this train is... seemingly going to leave. Is he on this train?
Should we get on it? I think he's trying to
trick us into getting on it. Here, we need to run up here. I mean, it literally
shows him right here. Maybe he is on the
dang train, I don't know. He's doing a relatively good
job of hiding somewhere. And you do have to
give it up for that. You do have to
respect him for that. Okay, wai-wai-wait.
Oh no, it just updated. Okay, no, he's over there. I got you.
Oh, there he is. Your train not cance— Your train didn't cancel
till here? No.
It canc— It got here. It got here,
and then it cancelled. I thought I
checked your platform. Well, I was...
prepared for that. Uh... Yeah, good luck!
(laughs) Bye, boys. I have to figure out
how to get outta here with all these cancellations. Okay. Okay, there's a train... going in the right direction. It leaves from here. Okay, that's my train. Ben's already on the move. That probably means he's
going down to Eindhoven. Oh, did that train
already leave? It left at 4:55 or 4:56. Okay, so it
left a minute ago. And he's on the move. Well, I think that was the only train
leaving the station. Well, it seems like the best
way around this signal fault. I have made it to Eindhoven. Eindhoven. Seemingly... my options are pretty limited. But I'm gonna pull a challenge. And because... desperate times call for
desperate measures... I am also going to be
doubling it. This is kind of my last shot. It's all gonna come down
to what I pull. The deck has gotten
a lot lighter since I last had it. Okay, we're gonna pull
a top one. Remember, this is doubled. Choose your own adventure. Do 50 burpees.
There is no time limit. A burpee has been

city's population. You get one guess. You must be within 25%
of the right answer or you automatically
veto this challenge. I think I'm
gonna do 50 burpees. 900 doubled, 1,800. That's pretty good. Maybe that gives me
some more options. There's a train to Brussels... at 5:41 from here. Two hours and 27 minutes. I could afford that
if I did this in time. Okay. We have to do 50 burpees. So... One. Okay, that was one. Two. Three. Oh my god. Ben is out in... Eindhoven, seemingly.
Yeah. So I think we just want to
take the soonest one to there, which is that 5:36
to Maastricht. We'll be free
three minutes before then. Yeah. I mean, that would be great. So the question now is does he head basically east, which would indicate
he's going to Germany, or west, which indicates
he's going down to Belgium? Or do we just catch him in, you know, about 20 minutes?
Or that. That's an option. Yeah, that's an option too. (tired huff) Four. (breathing heavily) Five. Oh god, oh no. Ohh, six. Ohh. (groan) Ah (bleep) Alright. So Ben... is... Well, let me check.
Ben is in Eindhoven. Is he still
in Eindhoven though? He is still in Eindhoven. He's still in Eindhoven. We will be there
in about 20 minutes. Yes. So that's not great
for Ben, I would say. So it is time for him
to get on a train. Yeah. Thirteen. Fourteen. Four...teen. He could take this to... Den Haag.
The Hague. That would be the wrong way. No, that would
take him to Breda. 'Cause he could do
Breda to Brussels. Right. Well he doesn't— He's not gonna have the
budget to get to Brussels. Ugh, 28. (grunt, panting) I think I can get to... I think I can get to Brussels, because there's a transfer... at Breda. It's 20 minutes, so I can finish this
challenge there. You can do it, pal. Ben should be leaving if he's on the train
that we think he's on. I mean, I— For his sake, I really
hope he is on it. Thirty... two. (shudder) Thirty seven. (exhausted breathing) Okay, here's the situation. I am on the train to Breda. I don't have enough
to keep going. But if I finish... thirteen burpees... in the train station
before my transfer... then I can make it and I can get out of there
and keep going. Pray for me. Ooh.
Oh. Ooh. Oh. That's looking—
There you go, Ben. There you go.
Nice job. Now that's resounding. I think he's... Yeah. Nice job.
Yeah. There you go, buddy. There you go, there you go. So that means Ben's
taking the French route. Which is smart. Or at least the Belgian route. Yes. One would assume. Or, at least, the Breda route. I mean,
it could also mean that Ben just panicked
and got on a train. (sigh) 20 minutes
until my next train. I don't have enough
to get on it, so I need to do
13 more burpees. One— Oh my god. That is the door. No, left. Okay, shut up. (sigh) Alright. So here's the sitch. Things are... good now but potentially could be
bad very soon in the future. Could swiftly turn from...
Yeah. ...great to... not as good.
I would say (bleep) Ben could get on a
train to Brussels and get all the way
to Brussels Airport before the rest period starts. Yes. Yes.
If he has the budget. Meanwhile, we would
be stuck in Breda because we couldn't get
on a train to Brussels. It would leave too late
for the rest period. And at that point... he would have built... almost an
hour and a half lead. Potentially more. Plus however long
it takes in the morning to get on a train towards him. 41. Ugh. 42. Ugh. Which is a far cry
from the 15-minute lead that he had...
just moments ago. So basically, if Ben has... right now, more than
1,200-ish coins, we're in a lot of trouble. (stiff groaning) 50. 50. (exhales loudly) 50. I did 50. Let's get on
the train to Brussels. Ohh. Oh, my whole body hurts. I've never done those before. What? Who the hell...
thought about those? I did that all so quickly, I didn't even have time to... look at what trains they
might even be on, so... I have no idea where
they could be right now. But I'm just hoping
that I can get on this train to Brussels
before they get here. That's all I got. So basically, if Ben is about
to get on a train to Brussels, if we are cutting— Look, here's the situation. I'm assuming that we just
cut from footage of Ben saying what he's about to do. And if what
he just said was, ""I'm getting on
a train to Brussels,"" then we are in a lot of trouble. I made it onto the train. Well, Adam... I have good news
and I have bad news. (guffaws)
Which one would you like first? Is the good news that
he's still at the station? No. Let's check how screwed
we are for tomorrow morning. Okay...? Alright, first train
from Breda to Brussels. Starting at 6 am. Eeegh, ooh. You want the bad news
or the bad news? (giggles) Not until 7:42? So Ben's 15 minute lead... Will now be two hours. Two hours, thanks to... train schedules/overnight. Oh, that's not great. So, yeah. (silly grumbles) We're sure there's nothing...? Well, we gotta get off now. So let's look at trains
leaving in the next hour. These are all going
back to the Netherlands. This one's heading to Brussels, but we can't take that one because its first stop is
after the rest period starts. We can't get to Antwerp tonight. No, we cannot get
to Antwerp tonight. So we can get to Rotterdam, but there's no sense
to go to Rotterdam because it's further away,
and the train that goes faster from Rotterdam to Brussels
is sold out. I think that might be
GG for today. What about if we... (bleep)
(both cracking up) What if we what, Adam? If we... (wheezes) Sure... Surely there's
something we can do. You wanna just go
straight to Zermatt? No, I don't wanna go
straight to Zermatt. They have glacier skiing. Yeah, I'm sure. I don't have a
lot of suggestions. Caption+ by JS*

see more of my run, you can watch next week's
episode right now, only on Nebula. On Nebula,
you can also listen to our Nebula-exclusive
podcast, The Layover, where we recap every
week's episode. This week we will
recap the strategy, the behind the scenes
of this episode. And we'll also reveal the exciting and strange
McDonald's items that we got from the
Belgian McDonald's during our rest period. Wait, what did we get? Well, I got... Well, don't tell them.
Well, you can't tell them. Yeah, it's exclusive. Anyway, Nebula is great,
in my opinion. And part of my opinion
is based on the fact that I was a co-founder
of Nebula, and that's 'cause myself and
a bunch of other creators, we got together
a couple years ago and we were basically asking, how do we create the
best viewing experience for viewers like you? And the most sustainable
platform for creators like us? And the answer was Nebula. From the audience's side, they get to watch all
these big-budget Originals where we give, you know,
we give creators more than they normally have to produce a normal
video on YouTube, and we see what they
can make with even more. So we've had some stuff,
like we had Patrick Willems's first
feature-length film, The Coconut,
it was awesome. Night of the Coconut.
Yeah. We had Philosophy Tube's
first kind of fully produced play. It was also awesome, and we filmed it and
put it on the platform. Tons more. It's great.
I love the Originals. And then of course
we also have all of these creators'
normal stuff ad free, a lot of it early. We have we have some
exclusive companion stuff like The Layover, for example. There's really so much to it, more than I can
possibly explain here. And then, on the flip side, what we do to make sure
the platform is sustainable for creators is a portion of the
subscription fee when you sign up as a viewer goes to the creator. So when you sign up,
for example, at nebula.tv/jetlag, we get a portion of that for
as long as you stay subscribed. Which gives us, you know, predictable recurring
monthly revenue that's not subject to kind
of the whims of ad rates that we can rely on
to grow our business and do more of Jet Lag and make it bigger
and better and cooler. So, yeah,
it really works well because it gives a better
viewing experience for you and a more sustainable
business model for us. So, make sure to click

to sign up. And thanks in advance
for your support. Bye!
Good bye!"

our game of Tag Across Europe. As a quick reminder,
each player in the game is trying to get to a
different location in Europe without getting tagged. Thanks to a series of
mishaps for the Chasers, Adam, the current Runner, is getting dangerously
close to his finish location on the island of Borkum. The good news for
the Chasers is that – thanks to delays – Adam is now stranded
in Münster, Germany, where our train should
be arriving any minute, giving us a perfect
opportunity to catch him. But he's got one last
plan to evade us. So I'm gonna stay here,
go into the city, far away from where
they would arrive. And to make sure
I don't get caught... You know I brought a disguise. Ever since last season, I was roasted within an
absolute inch of my life continually, until this day, for taking off
the wig that I wore. Just taking that unbelievably
stupid wig off for a second. Aah! (laughs) You got him?
I got him. Oh, that sucks so much! The problem was,
that I realized, the wig is way too hot. So instead... I've got a sun hat. Now the sun hat covers
the back of my head and the sides of my head
with these flappy things. Right?
I throw a mask on. There's no way you're
gonna know that that's me. Another thing I realized
about my disguise, and disguises in general,
is the key to them is that they can't
look like disguises. So you have to think,
what would go with the hat? What would somebody
actually wear with this hat? And what would also cover up
my bright pink shorts? Skirt. The backpack is... ...reversible. Plain grey backpack. Totally different vibe. They will not be looking for it. I have no idea where they are. Theoretically, they
could have gotten here about ten minutes ago,
at the earliest, I think. If all of my math and
guesses are right. I'm gonna guess... their train was probably delayed? Seemingly every train
was delayed. Ben, what did the
announcement just say? (snickers) The train is delayed
for 45 minutes. Because they... what?
What do they have to do? They're waiting for
the replacement crew here. They're waiting for
the replacement crew. Which is a thing. It is—
It's a very important thing. But it's currently 7:33. So that means
that we would— The rest period would start while this was still
stopped here in the station. Which means we have
to get off here and end our day here
in Dortmund. And not Münster, where Adam is. We can get on a train
tomorrow morning to Münster and get there before the
first train to Emden. And that definitely
won't be delayed. And it definitely
won't be delayed. It's the first
train of the day. Because the Deutsche Bahn... runs on time.
It's Germans. Oh, it's time to be real. Tomorrow morning... I'm gonna have to
find some way to sneak onto the train
at 7. It'll get me to Emden. I have the coins for it. I just have to get on it. I mean, I just literally
have no idea where they are. They might not even
be in the city. They might not even
be near the city. They also might already be here. How would you rate
our performance today? I would say our
performance was fine. I would say the... Deutsche Bahn's performance
was confusing. Hello. I declare ourselves done. We are declaring day
one done for the Chasers. We are stopping here. We will be here at... See you here. 6 am.
6 am. God, I'm so out of it. Good bye.
Bye. Oh, you can hear the bell.
That's nice. Yeah, so it's 8pm. So... now it's the rest period. We'll pick this up... at this exact spot
tomorrow morning. Like Adam said,
now it's the rest period. All players will go to
a hotel for the night. We will resume from the
exact spots we ended tomorrow morning at 6 am. That 6 am start is pretty
unfortunate for Adam. There's not a train
to Emden until 7:07, meaning he's stuck
in Münster until then. But there is a train
that Ben and I can take to Münster
that gets in at 6:54. Meaning that if all goes well, we'll have the
chance to catch him. Alright, good morning. Welcome back to
Münster, Germany, where we are
very scared and worried. The important thing is that I need to get on
a train at 7 am, in an hour from now. (sigh) And if they're here,
that means I'm gonna have to
sneak past them to get onto that train. They might not be
anywhere near here. They might be very far away. That would be very funny, if I'm in disguise
and they're very far away. Cut to them being
very far away. Hello! It is 6 am.
Good morning. And everything
is totally fine. And everything
continues to be totally fine. Yeah, absolutely great. So now, we are going to
hop on a train to Münster. Which is gonna be on time. Is that what that means? It can't possibly mean that. Well, it's not on there. Zug fällt aus. I know what that means.
Yeah. Why? He's gonna be able
to make it to Emden. And we're... We're not. We're gonna be able to
make it to Emden eventually. I'm so exposed. If they're here,
there's no way that they don't get me. I'm just like,
there's no one around. Literally every shape
I see, I think is them. Also, it doesn't help that
I don't have my glasses on. So I'll just see a
blurry set of colors and think it's Sam's hat. There is an 8:05 am
to Emden. Okay. So we get on this
delayed train to Münster. We miss the
first train to Emden. Adam is on that train,
probably. We get on the
next train to Emden. And hopefully he's
still stuck there... Because the ferry
doesn't leave... I think, until 12:30. Adam probably thinks
we have accidentally gone to Amsterdam
or something. It's gotta seem so strange. I would at least be
paranoid if I were him. I'm gonna go home
and board this train. I figure I'll sit
in a side seat... and look out the window. So that if they were to board, they wouldn't be
able to see my face. Okay, this is our train to... You want that one
or that one? Let's go to that one.
Okay. That one looks better. (whispering)
Oh, oh, here we go. Yes. Alright. I mean, unless they are somehow at a station above me... we're making it to Emden. Adam has sent us a... a yee-haw emoji,
a cowboy emoji. Which one's that? I don't know
what yee-haw means. I don't know what
yee-haw means. I think it means
that he got on that train. Oh, I guess he was probably
expecting us to get in before he got on a train.
Do you think he thinks he's constantly
swerving us or something? Well, yeah, yeah. Adam, I'm sure
whatever you're doing is really smart and cool, but... you can chill out
a little bit. (whispering)
This is my breakfast. Okay, so I'm about
to get to Emden, which is very exciting. There's a ferry from
Emden to Borkum. If I can get to Borkum,
to the lighthouse, I mean, I win automatically. And the problem is I'm getting into Emden
at 9:09. There's a ferry at 9,
so I'll miss that. And the next one
is not until 12:30. I have to imagine... that they will make it
to Emden at that time. I mean, it's
very, very possible that they're already
on their way here now. I'm gonna go to—
Train to Emden is here. I don't know. I don't know
what his plan is. I don't know
what he's gonna do when he gets to Emden. Well, that's the thing. He has to know at this point
that once he gets there, he's gonna have three and
a half hours until a ferry. So he's gotta have
more of a plan than just 'let's sit around'. I think the
move is gonna be... get to Emden,
stay in disguise, do challenges. See if I can save up for a powerup to slip past them at the
last minute, potentially. You know. We'll have to see. There is no way
that could be real. You crazy for this one, Germany. Alright, so I'm not
gonna double up, because that costs 250 coins. And right now I do have enough
coins to take the ferry. So I don't want to
risk losing those. You know, first do
no harm, basically. Cursed!
You are now a knight. You may only walk or run
in the pattern of a knight. For every three steps
forward you take, you must take
one step to the side. You will remain a knight
until you go to a castle. Alright, well... Is there a castle here? Okay, no, so there
are not any castles. Yeah, I think I have
to veto this. I think if my whole goal
is to avoid detection, I can't be walking
in a weird pattern. (deep sigh) Not great. Not great. Okay. Alright, let's just
kinda wander into the middle of
nowhere, shall we? Let's get far away from
where they will go. Do you have a
message for Adam, Sam? Hydrate or die-drate. Maybe I'll get
a coffee or something. That would be nice. You know,
make a day out of it. Make a morning of it. Alright, veto period's up. Draw another card.
Please be good this time. Find an American flag. Find a real American flag or a depiction of an
American flag in the wild. The flag cannot be
created by you in any way. Oof. Okay. Oof. Alright, I don't think I
want to veto this again. I need to start earning coins if I want to be able
to buy that powerup. Okay, let's think. Let's think.
Let's think. Alright, so my first
thought on this... is a grocery store. I feel like a grocery
store would be likely to have American-made products. And then those might have
an American flag on them. Oh no, they're all back
towards the train station. Oh crap, okay. 'Cause they could be getting
into that train station within 20 minutes. Okay, we're gonna run
to the grocery store. We're going to look
for flags on the way, and I should be able to
get to the grocery store and out before they
could get here. Life360 thinks
that Adam is driving. Do you think he's driving,
or do you think he's just... Oh, he could be on the bus.
...booking it? He's going
eight miles per hour, so he must be on a bus. Come on. Pick up the pace. Alright, we're in a little
more of a downtown-y area. We've got an Italian flag here. In this wine shop, maybe. Maybe on one of these ads. Domino's Pizza, come on. Come on,
give it to me, Domino's. Yeah, nothing. Alright, we gotta hurry. They're gonna be here
in nine minutes. We are not letting
him get out of Emden. Unless we accidentally do. Unless we
accidentally do, we won't. I wish everything
was not closed. No, there's a bank. Nope, okay. Alright, we might
have to veto this. But we're three minutes
from the grocery store. They might not even
be coming here yet. They might not...
be anywhere nearby. Oh, come on. It's like a novelty shop. It's got so much
American stuff. Simpsons. Come on. (whispers)
Oh, that's so close. That looks like an
American-themed thing. Oh (bleep)! Yes. Yes, there, boom. That is an American flag. Ca-caw! Alright, challenge complete. Oh my god. I did so much running. Alright, we need
to disguise up now. Pull another challenge. See what we get. Alright. New card, be a good one. Come on. Cursed! You now have
wet hat syndrome. For the rest of your run, your hat must be wet
at all times. In order to ensure your hat
remains sopping wet, you must completely drench
your hat in water every half hour. If at the half hour mark, you are unable
to soak your hat, you may not advance
in the game until you have done so. Okay, well... This is gonna be
funny with this hat, but that gets me... really, really close
to the coins I need. Basically,
any other challenge... and I can afford
the powerup. Let's buy water. Alright, you ready
to destroy Adam? Yes, we are here in Emden. Where Adam still is. And he is...
what did you say? Only an 8 minute walk from... 8–10 minute walk, yeah. From the station, so... The key is we've
gotta sneak up on him. Yeah, we can't let
this get into a foot race. Right there.
Nice. Hello... three water. Three water, Wasser. Danke. Guten Tag. Okay. (water dripping) Awesome. He's moving again. Maybe we want to get in a... ...taxi?
Well, it's so close that I kind of doubt
it's worth it. He's in a
big park or something. Alright, I'm going to
run for just a little bit to try to just build up
some distance on them, if they have just gotten here. Then I'll probably
just transition into walking as far away
as I can get. He is on this road,
but he's quite far. But we need to not get spot... Spotted. Let's actually cross the road, because that'll
restrict our sightline. Okay, okay. Okay, he's going
further that way now. Okay. But on the same road? Yes. He was just in this park. When we got to the station,
he was in this park. Okay. So we're not far at all. Look, it's the water. That's cool. Okay, well he's by water. He's already done the thing. He's by water? Yeah, he's by some little
canal or inlet or something. Okay. We are hot on his tail. Okay. So the key is then... we have to spot him
before he spots us. And we've got to be
really smart about when to go in
for the tag. Okay, so that's the waterway. You said he's on the other side. Here, you see? Here, Ben, look. We're right there. Well, I think what
we should do... One of us posts up there. The other one move in from here. From where
we are right now? Right, on this road. He's probably doing a challenge
and not paying attention. Alright, I think I'm far
enough away from the train station that I have time to
pull a quick challenge. Shuffle, shuffle. Cursed!
For the rest of your run, you may only
take transportation that leaves at
odd-numbered times. This is based on the last digit
of scheduled departure times. Nope. Nope. Definitely can't do that. (bleep) That's a veto. (bleep) So, you understand
where you're going? Yeah, so I'm
going down this road. Down this road,
to this crossroad there. Yep. Okay. I'll hide behind this corner. Yeah, yeah. Text me once you've arrived. Okay. Good luck. You too. Well... Shoot. Well, if they're not here yet... I have to guess that
they'll be here soon. I think we gotta
just keep moving. I think we gotta just
keep in motion here. Okay, so I'm here. Sam's here, Adam's there. It looks like
he's coming my way. He's probably about
to cross right up there. And then I will follow behind. Oh my god. He's in disguise. Yes. Hello?
Ben? Yeah, he's close. He's coming to you,
and he's in disguise. Okay. Oh, he's in disguise. I saw him. He's in a
sundress or something. (softly)
Sundress, okay got it. Got it, got it, got it. (slow-mo)
Ohhh (bleep)! (giggling) Come here, Adam! Oh my god, they're running.
They're running. There's no escape! I believe in you, Ben. I just don't think... (both panting exhaustedly) I don't think there was
a way out of that for me. I certainly don't
think you're getting on the ferry after that. One hell of a run! Well done. We got him! Let's go! Where the hell
were you guys? Ben, what's your prediction
on the first thing Adam will say
when we catch him? ""Oh, where were you guys?"" Where the hell were
you guys this morning? I thought you were
going to be in Münster. The Deutsche Bahn. Yeah, they're bad trains. Ohh. They have (bleep)-ed
us so many times. I can't even begin to describe. There's Sam. Yeah, I see him. Hi, Sam. Hello. How's it going? Nice little breezy
outfit you got there. Did it throw you off at all? What? No. I saw it immediately
and I was like, oh, he's in a disguise. Yeah, I was
worried about that. Well, anyway. I mean, good luck getting
out of my territory, boys. Cards! Cards! Give me your cards!
Give me your cards! In fairness...
Gimme your cards! In fairness,
I really needed them. Gimme the cards!
Okay! Okay! Here! Thank you. It's 10:31. I'm leaving. Good bye. Bye, Sam.
Good luck, Sam. Thank you, Ben. Okay, that was pretty
perfect timing. I have just enough time to make the next train south to Münster. Back at the station. Deutsche Bahn, please
don't let me down. Yeah, we just gotta get Sam. I think he has to— I think he basically has to go all the way back to Münster,
'cause these are all tiny regional stations.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, well, actually... If you were trying to
go directly to Paris... Yeah? It wouldn't have you
going back to Münster. Because this route gets him into
the Netherlands pretty quickly. Yeah, here we go.
Yeah, this, I agree. I think this is what he'll take. Emden to Salzbergen,
Salzbergen to Hengelo, Hengelo to Zutphen,
Zutphen to Breda, Breda to Antwerpen, Antwerpen to Paris. I think that is likely, right? I bet you that he goes
through the Netherlands just to avoid Deutsche Bahn. Alright, slight
change of plans. I've done some research, and I think there's
a better option than going all the
way back to Münster. Because I can get off
at a stop before them called Salzbergen. And from there... there is a
35-minute transfer to a train over the border
to the Netherlands. So we're going from
Deutschland to Dutchland. I'm sorry. What I can do after that
is I can string together a bunch of regional trains, kind of not through
big cities at all. And the advantage is they will mathematically
have to stay one hour behind on basically the
exact same trains. But, I will have some decent 30, 20, 40 minute
connections where I can hopefully
earn enough budget to be able to keep going. And I think it gets
better, because the advantage of getting down
into Belgium is from there, the fastest route for Ben
to get to his destination... The fastest route is
through Paris, my zone. So he's going to be incentivized
to go deeper into my zone. Which will advantage
me in the long term. So I think this is
the best bet. Alright, we're out
of our freeze period. And Sam has gotten on the train
that we expected him to get on. And there is another train... that does the same
thing in, what... half an hour?
30 minutes from now. It's just an hour behind Sam. Can we buy water on the way? We can.
I'm so thirsty. I accidentally
bought all sparkling water. Wasserbetten? I think Wasserbetten
sells water beds. Oh. Oh my gosh, Ben, Ben. Yeah? We have to get in Germany, Trolli Saure Glühwürmchen. Oh, they're glowworm. Ben, you can
finally find out what a glowworm tastes like. Oh, we're on
the train to Münster. But, in a much more
real sense, Adam... Where are we? Wait, wait, I was chewing. Oh. I'm gonna get to it. We're in The Snack Zone, baby! That's true. Today, we're gonna
be having some... Saure Glühwürmchen. It tastes like I'm
eating a real animal. Alright, welcome
to Salzbergen. Okay, so... Cards shuffled. Let's hope it's a good one. It seems that he is
stopping in Salzbergen, which means he's probably
gonna transfer to Hengelo. So...
Oh, this also means that if he (bleep) himself
on a challenge, if he does pull a challenge here
and he (bleep) himself... Yeah.
We'll get him there. We will, yeah. So, Sam, if you're
pulling a challenge there, good luck, buddy. 'Cause you're gonna need it. Let's hope it's a good one. Cursed! You are now being
Ratatouille'd. The next move you make
will be decided by a rat. Please access the
Smithsonian Zoo's naked mole rat live feed
and go to Camera 2. Whatever direction you first
see a rat cross the camera, you must travel at least
2 miles in that direction before continuing. Cursed. Oh no. Oh no. I've been Ratatouille'd. Oh no! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Alright, I wonder
what's gonna happen. (wheezes) If you're wondering
what's gonna happen, you can watch the
next episode right now by signing up for Nebula. What else you
can get on Nebula is the Layover podcast. It's the Nebula-exclusive
companion podcast to Jet Lag. We do an episode
every single week, correlating to each episode
of the season itself, explaining a little bit
more of the strategy, explaining what happens
off-camera. Answering for our failures, explaining some of the behind
the scenes production stuff. And we actually, we have a
lot of that this episode, because we talk about... we talk about what
would have happened if Adam had just won the season at the beginning of day two, after we flew
all the way to France... One ferry ride away, baby! ..to film a whole season
of Jet Lag. It would not have been awesome,
but we did have a plan. We did have a plan for
if that had happened. So we explain all of that in
the Layover episode this week. And also on Nebula, there's all kinds
of great other stuff from all of your other
favorite creators. There's a ton of
Nebula Originals. Those are exclusive projects
that are only on Nebula. Things like The Prince, a giant stage play
from Philosophy Tube. Things like
Night of the Coconut, an entire feature length
film from Patrick (H) Willems. Stuff from Real Science,
RealLifeLore, Real Engineering, all of the Reals,
a bunch of other things. And also, you know,
when you sign up for Nebula, you're helping to support
independent creators, because Nebula is creator-founded
and creator-owned. And if you want to sign up
for Nebula for a limited time, they're doing something
a little unusual: Lifetime memberships. So for $300
– a one-time payment – you can become a member
of Nebula for life. Now, I want to be clear.
This is not necessarily the cheapest way to get
access to Nebula. That would be the annual plan,
$30 a year with our code. This is for if you really
wanna support the show, and you really wanna
support Nebula. This gives the show and Nebula a lot of cash on-hand right now that we can invest in
future big projects. Future Jet Lag seasons and
future Nebula projects, and do that without
taking outside investment. So if you want to
sign up for Nebula, whether it's a monthly plan,
an annual plan, or you want to go big and
do the Lifetime membership and really, really support
Nebula or the show, but getting any of
them would be great. Head over to
nebula.tv/jetlag. Please do use
the code 'jetlag' so that they know
that we sent you. And thanks so much. Good bye."

Map data from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","PL1FHzZP_nM","Hello and
welcome to episode two of this game of
Tag Across Europe. Just as a quick refresher,
in this game, we're each trying to get to
a different place in Europe. Whichever of us is
the current Runner can spend coins to make
progress towards their location, while trying to avoid
capture from the Chasers. Last episode, on his way
to Zermatt, Switzerland, Ben ended up getting
caught in Meuse, a station in the middle
of absolutely nowhere. This made Adam the Runner and gave him a
massive opportunity. Using the reservation
he had made as a Chaser, he was able to get
right back on the train he took in Meuse before
it left the station. That train is headed
to Strasbourg, from which Adam could head
north towards Germany, to his location, Borkum. And to make matters
worse for me and Ben, who now need to catch Adam, the next train from
Meuse to Strasbourg isn't for three hours. Putting us
dangerously far behind. Adam has just been gifted... the biggest lead
this game has ever had. Well, why did
you catch me here? Why did you go here?! At the last station... That way... There was a train
one hour later to Strasbourg. But it doesn't stop here. But it doesn't stop here. Yeah, only half
the trains stop here. Look around! Okay so... I've dipped into the
little area between cars to explain the move. Basically, I'm back on the train that Sam and I were
just on to Strasbourg. I'm allowed to do that 'cause we initially booked a
reservation to Strasbourg. So I have to pay for it now, but I'm allowed to get on it. I have a reservation. The thing is... they can't get to
Strasbourg for— Three hours ahead. But only theoretically
three hours ahead. What, you banking
on a derailment? Well... we could call in a bomb threat. I just walked through
a car that was all children. Surely the children are
not traveling alone, all of them together, right? Comment below if children
have a special car or if that's just a band of... very transit-oriented children. Okay, hello. So we have done some research. We thought we were
extremely screwed. But it turns out we're
only very screwed. Two thirds of
extremely screwed. I mean, we looked
at every option. We've just spent
40 minutes researching. We wanted to see if we could
basically cut Adam off. We looked at flights.
We looked at trains. We looked at everything. And there's no way to really get
ahead of him on his route north. So we have to just
follow him basically. And hope he loses time. Well, fortunately, turns out, if we go backwards,
back to Champagne-Ardenne... then we can take a slightly
earlier train to Strasbourg and only be what,
two hours behind? It's better. Better. There's our train. That seems bad. (door clatters open) It seems bad. Au revoir, mon ami. Enjoy your trip at
Strasbourg. Alright,
welcome to Strasbourg. I'm just gonna get
outside the train station, and then I'll explain
my full plan. ♪ (upbeat folk music) That music is fun. Let's just get across
the street here. Oh, it's already
starting to get hot. Well, it's gotten toasty. It got toasty. Sam, would you believe that Adam Chase is in
Strasbourg, France, right now? I think I would believe,
I guess actually. Well, that's the case. That he's there. We should try and
figure out what... 12:46. 12:46?
12:46. That's his best
train outta there? Yeah, so it is
a bit of a walking. I mean, he's gonna rack up
some coins, no doubt. Yeah. Alright, so
here's the deal. The goal is to get to Borkum. But it's very far. So I'm not totally
gonna focus on getting all the way up just yet. I'm more focused on
getting to Münster. And I need to get on
that train at 12:46. So in about an hour and a half. To get to Münster, I need... I did the math on it. 3,820 coins. I have 550 right now. So basically I have
an hour and a half to earn just over 3,000 coins. Which... doable, not super easy. So I think that
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to buy the 250 coin powerup that doubles the value
of my next challenge, but it also doubles
the veto period. So it would be very
bad if I had to veto. Let's find out. Shuffle, shuffle. Congratulations, you're in
Amy's Trivia Corner! Amy has recorded three
trivia questions about Europe with increasing
levels of difficulty. You have one guess
at each answer. For each right answer,
you receive 400 coins. There is no punishment
for wrong answers in Amy's Trivia Corner. That's not how Amy rolls. This... rocks! Oh my gosh, this is amazing. This is the best card
in the deck. I am thrilled to be
in Amy's Trivia Corner because there is
no veto for this card. Alright. Let's see what's in store... in Amy's Trivia Corner. Oh, by the way,
if you didn't know, Amy is our colleague. She writes a lot of
Half as Interesting videos and sometimes helps
us with Jet Lag. Okay. Welcome to
Amy's Trivia Corner. Here is your first question. In 1911, a European painting
was iconically stolen. So iconically that when
the museum got it back years later...
It's the Mona Lisa. It was way more famous
than it had ever been. It's Mona Lisa.
I know this. So now if
you wanna see it, you're gonna have to
brave some serious crowds. What painting was that?
Yeah, it's the Mona Lisa. I know this. It's the Mona Lisa. It was the Mona Lisa.
It is the Mona Lisa. Thank you Amy. Okay, awesome. So that right away, 800 coins. Second question. Do you want some pizza? Pizza?
Yeah. Sure. They have pizza here? Boy, do I have
some news for you. Oh my god. Oh. That's— Ow. (giggles)
(bleep) I was so excited about this. (sigh) This rocks.
Second question. The German
language is full of tons of very useful,
very specific words. Wanderlust, schadenfreude,
Torschlusspanik. Which of these is the
definition of Torschlusspanik? A) fear of looking
like a tourist. B) realizing you left home
without turning the lights off. C) anxiety caused by
running out of time. Or D) a school or class that prepares children
for the first grade? Oh no. Oh, I don't know this at all. Torschlusspanik. Okay, 'panik', yeah. So sounding out,
'panik' would be anxiety. So I don't think it's D. But 'torsch' sounds
a lot like torch, and that would lead me to
think it's about lights. So I feel like it's B. I'm going B.
I'm going B. I would really like
it to be B, please. So the answer is C. No! Anxiety caused
by running out of time. No! You wouldn't know
anything about that would you? This sucks! It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. It's fine, it's fine.
Last question. Europe is a continent
of many distinct flags. Which of these four flags
is not the real flag of a European country? Oh god. Oh Jesus. One of them is Italy's. I know that for sure. Oh god. Okay, I think that B
is the Italian flag. D looks kind of familiar. It's between
A and C for me. I'm going A, but I
don't feel confident. The answer is A. Yes! Obviously, that—
Look at it. It's ridiculous. Couldn't possibly be real. Oh my god,
okay, incredible. So that is 1,600 coins
right there. It's half of what I need. (sigh) Thank you, Amy. Who needs human beings? They suck.
They suck. I wish I could install
one of those in my apartment. Welcome back to this episode
of Choo Choo Chew: Derailed. Yeah, I don't like
that you have completely co-opted
the Snack Empire that we built. And you didn't.
This is Snack Zone now. No, I said no. Okay, well that
turned out amazing. So I feel like it's probably
no longer worth the risk to double up again? I don't know. No, no.
I'm gonna double up. I'm gonna double up again. I'm trying to earn
coins right now. Focusing on coins. Shuffle, shuffle. Cut an orange in
half using only this card. Acquire an orange. Using only this card,
fully cut the orange in half. You cannot pry the orange open using your hands or the card. (exhales slowly) Okay. Okay. Okay, we have tested this. It is doable. It is not exactly easy. Because basically the
amount of time it takes to cut the orange is almost the exact
same amount of time that it takes to completely
disintegrate the card. Let's go... find an orange. Let's go find a
goddamned orange. The supermarket? Yes. Ooh, this one's pretty soft. This one is—
This is a winner. Merci. Sorry excuse me.
Are you Adam? Oh yeah, hey man.
I'm a big fan. Hey, great
to meet you, dude. I've seen all six seasons. What's your name?
Sid. Sid, good
to meet you, dude. Alright, Sid, I... You can hang with me
if you want. But while we hang, I have to cut an orange
in half using only this card. But if you wanna sit down
with me while we do it. Okay, yeah,
I can sit down. You can totally chill. I think I need to start by
focusing on getting all the skin, and then I'll focus
on the flesh. Okay, okay. See if I can get— Okay, so we're already in,
so this feels good. Oh, but see, I just bent it. So we gotta be mad careful here. So I'm gonna take—
I'm gonna just go— I'm gonna do one side at a time. And I cannot
help you in any way. No, no, no, certainly not. But you can help me
by chilling here. Yeah. Oh goodness. Sid, would you mind
checking to make sure that I'm in—
that we're in frame? Oh, yeah, we are.
Okay, fantastic. Okay, okay, this was good. This was good.
Look, look, look. Yeah? I've almost
got all of the... The skin. Yeah, yeah, almost
all the skin, okay. I'm gonna try to make sure the camera can see
what I'm doing. Okay, that feels huge. So we've got,
we've cut all the skin. So now I think we just have
to get through the middle. Yeah. And I think
you'll be— Oh, oh, this
is feeling good. Yeah? This is feeling good. You got it.
This is feeling— Oh, I got close. But I did not
quite get there. Okay. Here we go. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh, oh, okay. Okay, look, see? Here's the state of the game. The card is falling apart. We are so close on the orange. Almost there.
Okay. I think a fold? Do you think?
Yeah, I think a fold. Because it's really
more about just pushing. Yeah.
Oh god. Oh, we're so close, okay.
Almost, almost. It's literally just this. Okay, I think maybe with this. Yes... Ha ha! You did it. There we go, alright. That is huge news. It's so great to meet you, Sid. Nice to meet ya.
See ya. Bye. (groans) What do you
think Adam's up to? You know what
I bet he's not up to? Being chill? And eating a delightful
vending machine pizza in the sun. Can I eat
some of this orange? Okay, so this is great. So I'm only
670 coins short. So I think at this point, it is probably not
worth it to double up. Because I sort of risk
getting (bleep)-ed. And I would prefer
not to get (bleep)-ed if that makes sense. Alright. Shuffle, shuffle. Fight them on the beaches. Send a menacing image
to the Chasers from three of the
following locations: A beach (anywhere where
natural water meets land), A landing ground (any spot
where an aircraft lands), a field, a street, a hill. Okay. Okay, sure, sure, sure, sure. Oh wait, (bleep) (wheezes) This puts me 70 coins
short of what I need. That's annoying. It's fine. It's fine, it's fine,
it's fine, okay. This is a reference to a
Winston Churchill speech, if you didn't get that. But anyway, alright. Menacing image. Alright, I'm gonna
make them tell a story. I suggest checking
your SMS text messages. Oh, okay. Oh, oh, he's—
Uh-oh. He looks very menacing. Oh my god. I feel very menaced. He looks like
he's about to punch us. Do you think Adam's
ever punched anyone? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. (rapping) ♪ Let's go
to the beach, beach ♪ ♪ Let's go get away ♪ ♪ They say what they gonna say ♪ ♪ Have a drink, clink,
found a Bud Light ♪ ♪ Bad (bleep) like me
is hard to come by ♪ Ninki Minjaj. So the card defines
'beach' very loosely. Anywhere where... natural water meets land. And now a field. This is beautiful. Ooh, I'm gonna go
under this cool bridge. Wheeee! Wheeee! This is for sure a field. 600 more coins, baby. This is going really well.
Here we go. I feel like I'm
due for a hard one. Answer a riddle
under a bridge. Tristan has recorded a
riddle for you to answer. You are permitted one guess. If you are wrong,
this card is vetoed. You must answer the
riddle beneath a bridge. Once beneath the bridge, you cannot leave until
you have attempted an answer. Okay. Well, I know how to
get under a bridge. Alright, Tristan. Let's see what you got. Adam is... by a river. I wonder if he's doing a riddle. Under a bridge?
Mhm. I sure hope so. I feel bad that... Tristan keeps recording
these riddles for us. Hi! Alright, time for a riddle. Hi, Tristan. I tried to get under
a bridge in solidarity, but couldn't quite make it. But here we go. I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. And everywhere I go,
darkness follows. Think about
that for a second. I hope you're having
a good Jet Lag, by the way. Oh, fisherman. Okay, I'm gonna read
the answer now. The answer is clouds. That's slightly concerning. There's a jet. It's like a military jet. I hope this is our
last stop here. Yeah. I can only take so
much vending machine pizza. Well, you don't
have to get a vending machine pizza
every time. Yes, yes, you do, Ben. Now, Ben and I are finally
headed for Strasbourg, where Adam has been
doing challenges. With the riddle complete, Adam has earned enough to get
him all the way to Münster. He'll take a train to Offenburg, transfer onto a
train to Karlsruhe, and then finally onto one long
regional train to Münster. That first train to Offenburg
leaves in 35 minutes, right before we
arrive in Strasbourg. But if he can earn another
980 coins before he leaves, he'll have enough to get him
all the way to his finish line without ever needing to
stop for a challenge again. So... My train is in 35 minutes. I'm gonna pull one more card. 'Cause I still have
time to veto. Make a putt. Roll a ball into a cup
from a distance of 10 feet. The cup may be no larger
than six inches in diameter. You may spend
as long as you wish setting up items
to aid its roll. You get one attempt. If you fail, the challenge
is automatically vetoed. Ooh. This one is very funny
to get in this circumstance. Alright, I have five minutes
to do this attempt. Big cup. Okay. Yeah, it's the best
we're gonna do. Alright. Smooth surface. Where's gonna have a
really smooth surface? This is like cobblestone,
which I don't... I don't like that. Okay, these floors are smoother. I would need space. The idea of this card
is that we figured you would most likely
spend quite a while setting up your shot... 'cause you only get
one chance at it. I am in a position where I... just don't have time
to do that, so... (sighs) I think we're just gonna have
to kind of go for it here. (clatter) We are officially
going to Germany. Alright, I believe... we have just passed
into Germany. Yes. This is Kehl. Welcome to Kehl. Welcome to the great
country of Germany. A country that is good and
other times has been bad before, but seems mostly good now. Sam, welcome to
beautiful Strasbourg. Welcome back.
Welcome back. We've been here before. Yeah. In a similar situation. Hey, look, guns. Nice, you should definitely
film the people with guns. We are not gonna
be here for long. We are going to go
right to Frankfurt, to try and cut Adam off. We need... We're catching up. Reservations on that train. And the website is...
(bleep) us. So, we have to go
talk to a real person. Which, neither
of us like to do. Ah, real people suck. Okay. (moans) Now it filled
up in the one minute. That's brutal. Okay. Team Bam has been
vinced once again. Well, we tried to
go book a reservation on the next train to Frankfurt, and it was full. I mean, there's a
train an hour later, but I would like to not
lose a whole 'nother hour. Alright, pulling
into Offenburg. I'll have three minutes
to make my connection? That shouldn't be
a problem at all. Deutsche Bahn is so reliable. Okay, okay. It leaves in three minutes. I legit might miss it. If I miss this train... it will throw my
whole plan off. What, I don't know
what these signs mean. I just need to find
a departure board. Oh, come on, come on, come on. Platform three.
Oh, thank god. Okay, Google knew. Okay. I think it turned out it was
actually just on the platform immediately opposite me... to start with. But that's fine. I am gonna make it
on the train. Lots of luck in your
senior year, boys. Well, we've looked
at our options, and yeah. I think the consensus is 'cause that train was
fully lost an hour. The best train is
the one at 2:51. Well, the best train is the one in 5–6 minutes, but... The best train that's
not full. Yes. You know what?
I'm flipping the script. We're totally fine, Ben.
We're gonna crush it. We are gonna crush it.
In fact, we are crushing it. We are currently crushing
it while sitting here. And everything is fine.
And you know what? He has a whole—
(stammers) He's got— Alright. Welcome to Karlsruhe. And folks, we are
on the same train for about
four and a half hours. It's a very good move for me. It's a very good move for me. So, you know... Sucks for you! You know what we need? Unsafe amounts of caffeine. So Ben has never in his
life had a Red Bull. So welcome to
The Snack Zone. This is a solicitation
for sponsorship. Okay.
Cheers. (can opening) Prost. Why does it taste like this? Adam, I hope you
get hit by a train. (imitating dripping) It's a very
different shape. (indistinct)
Love it. The man is in Mannheim. Looks like he, yeah. Looks like he's probably
continuing past Mannheim. Well, we would have
this happen eventually. Yes, probably. I'm mostly, yeah, probably. Alright, so
all this is Mannheim. What can we learn
about Mannheim? Okay. Mannheim is the
second largest city in the German state
of Baden-Württemberg after the state capital,
which is Stuttgart. It's Germany's 21st largest city. All that is pretty boring. Okay, we're making
a quick little transfer. Welcome to Germany, Sam. Choo-choo. I have news. What's the dealio, Sam? Adam has passed Frankfurt. He's passed Frankfurt? But... he is not on
the high-speed line. Interesting. He seems to be
on a regional line. Well, that means he's
gonna lose some valuable time. Adam's route
does look delightful. He's riding by the Rhine. Ooh. Well, you know... At least he gets a little
treat before we destroy him. Oh my gosh.
There's a castle up there. I'm gonna text Ben and Sam. It's so sad... that they aren't seeing
this incredible view. Adam is texting us pictures
of the Rhine to make us jealous. He's taunting us. So Sam is trying
to come up with genius psychological warfare. What have you got, Sam? No, we were brainstorming
collaboratively. What if we sent him
a picture of the Rhine? That's a good idea. No, that's not bad. Sam, what's the sitch? Okay, VO Sam here
to explain the sitch. Right now, we're all
headed to Münster. Adam's train is scheduled
to get in at around 7 pm, an hour before our
first rest period. Every night at 8 pm, the game pauses for 10 hours
so that we can sleep. And then at 6 am
the next morning, everyone returns to
exactly where they were. Adam's plan is to
make a quick transfer onto a train towards
Emden tonight, where the ferry
to Borkum departs. He won't be able to get
all the way to Emden before the rest period, but he should be able to make
it to a town called Lingen. Most importantly,
he really needs to make it onto a train
out of Münster tonight, because we're gaining
ground on him. Our train is faster and it's
scheduled to get into Münster only an hour after him. But to make matters
worse for Adam, his train is about a
half hour behind schedule, meaning he's about to
miss his connection. But because all the announcements
have been in German, he hasn't realized
that until just... now. Alright, my train is
getting in... seemingly very late? I don't know how late... But it was supposed to be
in Münster a minute ago. And it's still going very fast. As you can see. My GPS isn't really
working very well, so I can't actually tell
how far from Münster we are. But I'm getting pretty
scared that it's far. So if it doesn't arrive
within the next six minutes... we are not getting to Lingen. And I'm pretty sure Ben and
Sam are gonna be at my station in under an hour. So... I might need to look
into backup plans. I always get so much
comment section critique for confidence in this game. But it's manifesting. Manifesting works.
Manifesting— You've gotta
visualize your success. That's real science. You've gotta
believe in yourself. Yep. Even if it— Even if all of the odds are
against you. I know with 100% certainty that I will win this season. What? My location is updated now. I'm not even close! What the (bleep)? Wha... What? I'm not gonna make
it onto my train. I'm gonna arrive to my station. Ben and Sam are gonna be
there within like 30 minutes. I don't understand
what happened. My train was never
delayed at any point. I don't understand how it's
gonna get in 20–30 minutes late. He's on a (bleep)
ghost train, Ben. We don't know what he's on. But what we do know is
that we got two beers. Zwei... beer.
I definitely need this. Is what I said to the woman. You're not gonna cheers?
That's kind of rude. (clink) Thank you. Excited to spend
a lovely night in Münster. I am... Münster... I'm gonna eat so much cheese. I hope it's actually the place
that the cheese comes from. Oh, we're here. Okay. Okay, so my train got in... almost a full
30 minutes late. Which is infuriating 'cause
it wasn't delayed in any way, and there was no warning
that that would happen. So that means I am
for sure not going to make the train that I thought
I was going to get on. But it's kind of fine? Because I found a backup... that goes in the right
direction at least. I'll have to get
off a stop earlier. Oh my gosh, I thought
that woman was Sam. Okay. So Adam is in Münster. It would be ideal
if he stopped in Münster, 'cause then there's a chance
we could catch him there. Yeah. Otherwise I don't think we're
gonna even have a chance to catch him until
he gets all the way. Mhm. It looks like he's on the street. So it looks like
he's gotten off. This is very confusing. I like the French ones better. This is confusing. Tell me what (bleep)
platform it's on. There's no information. There's literally nothing
on here about this. Okay. Okay, we're just gonna have
to look at every platform. I think they're gonna
be here in 20 minutes. No. No. No. No. Okay. Oh no. Okay, it's delayed by 20 minutes. (bleep) They would get here
in 20 minutes. They would be here...
in 20 minutes. I'm almost certain. Let's go back to the board. Okay, okay. Okay, what are my options? Let's just look at these. This goes to (bleep)
Dortmund. That's... (bleep) That...
No, that doesn't work. They're all delayed. None of this makes any sense. None of this makes any sense! (bleep)-ing what the
(bleep) is going on here? What is happening?
What is happening? They're gonna be here soon. Alright, all of the trains
are super confusing. None of them make
any sense at all. So new plan. We're gonna stay in Münster. We are going to attempt
tomorrow morning... to sneak onto a train. I'm gonna get into the city. I'm gonna hide. And to make sure I
don't get caught... You know I brought a disguise. Caption+ by JS*

we all get together. We break down
some of the strategy that went on in the episode. We dive deep on all the stuff
that was behind the scenes that we didn't have
time to put in. And this week's episode is definitely going to
be an interesting one. There's definitely
a lot to answer for. Yeah. But there's more, right? Yeah, so Nebula,
if you don't know, it's a creator-founded,
creator-owned, creator-run streaming service that was basically founded by a big group of YouTube creators with the intention
that it would be the best home for their content. So, not only do you get the
best Jet Lag experience, but you also get to see
a ton of original content that can only be viewed
on Nebula. We've made a ton of
Nebula Originals. A lot of other creators
have made Nebula Originals. They're basically
bigger budget versions of the stuff that
we make on YouTube. So we are now offering
on Nebula a Lifetime Subscription. You can get access
to Nebula forever. Never pay Nebula another dime. You just got access
to it for life. This is not the most
money-efficient way of signing up for Nebula. That would be the
annual subscription. But if you really want
to support the show, a huge portion of
that money goes to us, and it comes to us up-front,
which helps us fund bigger, more absurd
seasons in the future. And, again, you know,
the value you get, it's not just the best viewing
experience for Jet Lag, it's not just supporting
Jet Lag. It's doing that for
all sorts of creators, many of whom you
probably already watch. So, make sure to click
the button on screen or go to
nebula.tv/jetlag to get 40% off an
annual subscription. And thank you in advance
for your support. Bye! See you there!
Thank you!"

Charleville, France. We're playing
Tag Across Europe. But that bell means it's 6 am,
and Ben's the runner, so he's gotta go,
go, go, go, go, go! Go, Ben!
Go, Ben! Alright, here we go! We're doing tag again. This time,
I'm off to Switzerland. Good luck, Ben! Alright, well
we got 45 minutes. So I guess we gotta plan
how to catch him. Alright, so here's
how the game works. We're here in
Charleville-Mézières, France, because it's the
approximate midpoint between these three
locations in Europe. In this game, Ben is
trying to get here to Zermatt, Switzerland, Adam is trying to get
here to Borkum, Germany, and I, Sam am trying to
get here to Jersey, UK. Right now, Ben's the Runner. While you're the Runner, you can move towards
your location. If you can make it
all the way there, you win the game immediately. But if no one makes
it to their location, the win goes to
whoever's location is closest to the Runner
at the end of 72 hours, which you can see by
looking at these win areas. While the Runner heads
for their location, the other two players will
act as ""it"", aka Chasers. They'll have a
live tracker on the Runner and work together to tag them. Once the Runner is tagged,
their positions rotate. The Runner becomes a Chaser, and the next Chaser
becomes the Runner. So now, back to Ben who needs to
come up with a plan to get outta
Charleville-Mézières before we can come after him. Okay. Looking at the timetables
for this morning, there's at least one train that leaves before they're out of
their freeze period. And that is to Reims, Champagne-Ardenne Station
in Reims. That's in about a half an hour. I love that the
whole town is set up as a beach for
some reason, again. Sam, I think that we should
film our strategy discussion with our heads in that thing. So Adam, I think
the first thing is we have to figure out
which train he's on. Yeah, I mean,
I know that there is a train this morning that goes to Champagne-Ardenne. My guess is that
he'll go on that. 'Cause the only other train
this morning goes north. And I don't think
he'll wanna take that. Yeah, okay. But let's
look at where he is. ♪ We're back at the
Charleville station ♪ ♪ And we're gonna get
a little brekkie ♪ Ooh, can I get brekkie
at this... vending machine? It worked. (clattering)
Oh... Oh, oh, I think my
hand is trapped. Okay, so... I don't even know if
Ben will figure this out, because it doesn't
actually go to the stop that he's going to,
but there's a very high-speed train
– a TGV – that stops at Reims, which is one— just right
next to Champagne-Ardenne, where he will get. And we could just take a taxi
from Reims to Champagne-Ardenne. That'd be very quick. I don't think
he'll think of that, if I'm being honest. He's gotten more experienced. He's got a big brain. He went to Brown. Oh. Okay, we got it. Now I'm also gonna get a
little bottle of water. (British accent)
Boh-ohl of wa-aah. That's the thing
about this season, is we're all going into this with a whole season of
failures under our belt. That's true.
That we've learned from. (bottle drops) (flap opens, clatters) Oh my hand's trapped again. Ah! (bottle crinkling) Oh, it's a (bleep)
death trap, okay. That's me. Off to Reims. It's almost time.
Yeah. We have one more minute
'til we can go after Ben. Although this time,
we don't have to run, because our train
Yeah, we have plenty of time. Doesn't leave
for a half hour. And also you can't run. Yes. For old time's sake, I think we should run
for five seconds, just for the vibes. It's 6:45. (bells ringing) Let's do it! Let's do
our running for vibes! Vibe run! Okay, now let's walk. We're on the
way to the station. Are you
chasing someone or...? Maybe. Well, I think that
if you know the format, we have to admit that
we are chasing someone. Okay, it's 6:45. That means the chasers
have been released. And they're after me. And you know... Last time, I was scared. This time... I'm making it
all the way, baby. There's not gonna be a single
tag in this game of tag. We're gonna have to call it
something different than tag. We're gonna have to call it... Wait, wait. The TGV's a half hour late? Yes. Uh-oh. That might change our plan. Oh goodness. Okay, well thank you
for this update, Sophie. We maybe should take the
slow regional train then. Yeah, yeah. (sigh) Unfortunate. This means probably
Ben never realized we could get there
the faster way. And we're doing what he thinks. 'Cause he's just
navigating on vibes. Right. Okay, so I am on
this train for 58 minutes. And in order to move in
this game as a Runner, you have to pay for all of
your transportation with coins. So real quick,
while you're the Runner, you have to pay for all your
transportation using coins. Other than running,
you can take trains, metros, planes,
ferries, or bikes. Each form of transportation
costs a different amount, and is paid for by the minute. Every player starts
with 2,000 coins which isn't enough
to get them very far. If they want to earn more,
they have to pull a randomly selected card
from the challenge deck. If they complete the challenge,
they earn the reward. But if they fail to,
or choose to veto it, they can only walk or run
for the next 30 minutes. And this train is
gonna cost me 580 coins, because it's 58 minutes
on low-speed rail. I'm gonna have
an hour in Champagne before Sam and Adam
could show up. So I'm gonna try and pull
a card when I get there and knock out a challenge, earn some more coins
before I keep moving. And hopefully I don't get screwed. That's the plan. I mean, delayed
by a half hour. That's a long delay. That's tough stuff, yeah. Alright, Sam,
while we wait around... This is probably a bad idea
and will cost a lot of money, but I want you to suggest a strange and exciting
motion graphic that we are gonna put
in the video right now. I would like to see... Bowser. Bowser?
Bowser. From like Mario? Yeah. Do we have
the rights to that? No, no, actually no. Mayor Muriel Bowser
of Washington, DC. (wheezes)
Okay, okay. Sorry. Change of plans. Mayor Muriel Bowser
of Washington, DC... with laser eyes. Okay. In the middle
of the bandstand. Great.
Basically... destroying the bandstand. Okay, I think
that'd be good. Yeah. Okay, now react to it. Now react to
how crazy it looks. Mayor Muriel Bowser? This is not what I voted for. Alright, let's go. Let's go wait in the station. Platform two. Platform two, alright. Platform two. Hello, friend. Choo-choo. By the way, confirmed. Ben has passed (with cough) Reims
downtown station. So he is going— So he's almost certainly
going to Champagne-Ardenne. Alright. Hello and welcome to the beautiful
vineyards of Champagne. I was looking at
some train schedules, and I'm pretty sure... And I could be wrong
– I'm often wrong – but I'm pretty sure that Sam and Adam cannot
get here until 8:48. So... I need to get on a train
out of here before 8:48 is the idea. Fortunately, it seems like
there's a couple of good options. There's a train to Nancy, and there's a train
to Strasbourg. And both of those are... basically in the right direction, so I think they're both perfect. But I don't have enough
to take either of them, at least all the way. So, that means it's time to pull the first card
of this season. And hopefully, it is fine. First card. Do a taste test. Acquire a bag of
Haribo Gold Bears. Close your eyes. Taste three gold bears
and guess their flavors. You must get all three correct. If you do not succeed, you must wait 10 minutes
before trying again. You may practice. I am good... at tasting candy. The only question is, can I get
Haribo Gold Bears here? (strained grunting) Ben has officially
arrived at his first stop, Champagne-Ardenne station. And that is where he can transfer to a TGV
to Strasbourg. Right.
In not very long from now. If he gets on the
next train to Strasbourg, our only option is
just to follow him on the train that's
an hour later. Yeah. Whatever.
Which is... I mean it's fine, but... Just doesn't
get us any closer. We continue
to be behind him. Yeah. That's not great. So, yeah. So we just have to hope
that his challenges go badly. Okay, there's
a vending machine. There's some Haribo,
but not... Not the bears. (bleep) Ugh. Says there's another Relay a quarter mile from here. Maybe they'll have Gold Bears. Ohh. Now here—
But here's the thing. He is gonna have to earn
just over 1,000 coins to get on that train. Yeah, and then— There's not a lot around him. This station is kind of
on the edge of the city. Yeah, so I don't know. Could be tough. The (bleep)? What are all these buildings? What is Yanmar? That's not a Relay. It says I'm at the Relay. It doesn't exist. Okay. Yeah, this is a construction
equipment building. Okay. That's okay. We're going... back to
the train station. We can't complete
this challenge here. But, I can get on
another train. It looks like Ben is
going back to the station? He was outta the station, and it's now showing
him back in the station. Are there other trains? Let's just look at,
I don't know. Nope, the next train is
the one to Strasbourg. Okay, well... So... he's either on that
or not on any train. Let's hope he's not
on any train. We can hope. Okay, here's the dealio. So I could not earn enough to
go all the way to Strasbourg, but what I can do and what I'm gonna do is I can get on the
train to Strasbourg, but not go all the way there. I can get off a stop... called Lorraine,
and go to Lorraine. Which is still
going the right way. And then... do... some challenges in Lorraine and keep going from there. I don't know how much time
that will buy me. But I think that this... is my best option right now. So that's what I'm gonna do. That's me. Okay, here we go. His circle is moving. We're not... He's definitely on
the way to Strasbourg. Oh god. I can't believe we let him
get all the way to Germany. Well, there was
literally nothing we could do. Well, yeah, I mean,
I guess I would say I can't believe that the failure of the
French train system let him get all
the way to Germany. True. Alright, welcome back
to Champagne-Ardenne. One funny thing is
that I didn't pack layers, 'cause I just thought the odds we would specifically
end up in Zermatt were so low. But now... Not only would
we end up in Zermatt. I think our
finish location— It's on top of a mountain. Well, we just have to
hang out here until... the next train comes. It's already
been three hours. Yeah. Three hours
without catching Ben. I would say that things
are not going great. It's three hours,
and the earliest possible we could catch him
is two hours from now. Yeah. Theoretically, he— There is one intermediate
stop that he could make. Nah, I doubt it. It would be an
interesting move. Maybe if he didn't have... the budget or something, and well, he's getting to
that intermediate stop now. (chimes) (door slides open) Alright,
welcome to Lorraine. So I only have 470 coins. So, I gotta find some
gummy bears fast, before I can get on
another train. So let's look for
gummy bears. I'm just saying... I feel like France... Okay.
This is a problem. I feel like 60 years ago— We completely missed
the pizza vending machine. There's a pizza—
Oh my god. I want that.
Do we have time? We have 15 minutes. Sacrée Pizza. Says 3–4 minutes. Three to four?
That's what it says. Oh, great. (gasp) That's what
I'm talking about. Bonjour.
Bonjour. It is fortunate
that this train station had Gold Bears, because— I just wanna pop
outside for a second. There is nothing... else for miles. It's just fields. It's literally just fields. Wait, Sam,
it's about to come out! It's about to pop out!
Moo! Sam, you have to
film it coming out. I know that's a sheep. (both moaning) Ohohoho! It's hot, it's so hot. Thank you, vending
machine pizza man. Wow, that is surprisingly cooked. Okay. Okay, hi. We're here in Lorraine,
beautiful Lorraine. And we're gonna do a taste test. Closing my eyes, here's the bear. You now know what flavor it is. I don't. It's citrusy. I think it's either
lemon or orange. I'm going with lemon.
Going with lemon. Now I'm gonna check. Platform three. There's sort of
like a little tear. I wonder if I can
sort of tear the pizza. Our train is here.
No, that didn't work. Our train's here. Oh yeah. Okay, I got that one right. So we're on to number two. We're gonna close our eyes. Here's the bear. It tastes exactly the same. I think it's also lemon. Okay, right again. If I get this last bear,
I win the challenge. Here's our last bear. Apple. It's apple. I'm gonna check, but
I'm 100% sure I'm right. Okay, I got that one right. That means... the 800 coins are mine. The question is,
what am I gonna do with them? Because I need to
get out of here... before Sam and Adam
can get to me. Okay. There's one train
that leaves from here before the train that I
assume they're on gets here. And that... goes... back right the way
that I came. It stops in Meuse. I could go there. I think their train also
stops in Meuse, but... They might not think
to get off there. Yeah, I mean, I think I
have to get on that train. Because the next train
that's getting here is the one that I really
think that they're on. So, I think I'm gonna
go back to Meuse. I hope I'm
pronouncing that right. They might not even—
I mean, look. They might not
even be on that train that I think that they're on. This whole thing might
be really stupid, but... (sigh) You know what? They won't expect me
to go to Meuse. And I'm not like
other boys, you know? I go to Meuse. Alright, alright. Getting off here in Meuse. They're either here
or they're not. Alright, let's go.
Let's go, let's go. Yes, we gotta get to the
other side of the station. Do you want me to run ahead? Yeah. Okay, here, take the pizza. Okay. Don't get stuck on the train. I don't see them. This is a real small station. You're tagged, buddy. What happened?
You ran outta coins? It was a gamble.
It was a gamble. I was doing a little gamble. Whew. Yeah, I was hoping you
guys were gonna get on it. Oh... well why
didn't you hide? I recognize this guy. I tagged him. Alright, give me
the cards right now. Okay, Adam... Wait. Gimme the cards right now. There you go. Good bye.
Bye. Good luck. I wonder what train
he's getting on. Well, he's probably trying
to get back on our— Oh, he already has a ticket on our train on
the other platform. Excuse me. I would propose we
start doing some research about various things
that he will do. Let's figure it out.
I mean— I mean we can safely
assume that he's probably going to
Strasbourg right now. There's a small chance he gets
off of the station before, but I think Strasbourg
certainly makes sense, and he has the budget
to get there, I believe. I mean, I was just— Yeah, he can definitely
get to Strasbourg, and the station before it,
as I just discovered, is nothing. You forget something? No, no, it's
very hard to explain. We're playing a game. Yeah? So I just caught my friend. Okay. So now I'm back on
here going to Strasbourg. Okay, and your friend? He has to stay
here for a while. It says that there's not
another one to Strasbourg... until 1:30. No.
That can't be right. Eh? No, no. No. Hold on though. Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no. We can kind of
go back to Paris. Well... Okay, it's fine. Adam's got... No. Like a... three hour lead. No. It's fine. But—
Oh no. Oh, oh no— Beeeen! While you stay here? Yeah.
What kind of game? You know tag? Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus You're off! You're headed to Borkum. I'm headed to Borkum! And you could watch that
episode right now on Nebula. Yeah, and that's because,
for those of you who don't know, we put every single
episode of Jet Lag up one week early on Nebula. Because basically all
the revenue for this show comes from our
Nebula subscribers. So, we thank them for that by putting the
whole show out early. So, next episode is out
right now on Nebula, and every single
episode after that will also be out
one week early on Nebula. And also on Nebula
is our exclusive podcast where we recap
every week's episode. We get on a call and
we talk through... usually a lot of times
there's a lot of strategy that we didn't get time to
get into in the episode. And we get to talk
about all of that and really give you
the behind the scenes. And that's only on Nebula. And Nebula's
not just our stuff. There are a bunch
of amazing creators, some of whom you've
probably already watched, who put out their stuff
ad-free and early on Nebula and make amazing original series like RealLifeLore's
Modern Conflicts series or Real Engineering's
Battle of Britain series. Both the Reals.
Both the Reals. All the Reals. They make amazing stuff. And there's tons of other
stuff you can watch on Nebula. And the good news is
that if you sign up with our link
– nebula.tv/jetlag – you'll get 40% off
the annual subscription, which brings the price
down to under $3 a month. It's really not expensive at all And it gets you the best
Jet Lag viewing experience and the best viewing experience
for all sorts of creators that you probably already watch. And if anyone wants
to support even more, it's called the
Lifetime membership. Basically, if you really
want to help support us and get us kind of
revenue up-front that we can use to
invest in future seasons, you can get a
Lifetime Subscription. To be honest, it's not
the most economical way to get access to Nebula.

to the finale of Capture the Flag
across Japan. By the end of this episode, one of these two teams will be
crowned the winner of this season. The game was meant to be
played in three rounds, but we ended round three
in a tie. Both teams have three points, meaning for the first time
in Jet Lag history, the game all comes down
to a tiebreaker round. So here's how
the tiebreaker works. We've placed seven flags
around Tokyo, fair game for either team. The first team to successfully
return four of them to Tokyo Station wins. The whole map is a
no man's land. Players can be tagged
anywhere at any time. If a player is tagged, they drop
any flags that they're holding and freeze in place
for five minutes. Because of all the
new complications, we've also simplified. There are no more coins,
no more challenges, and no more towers. It's all gonna come down to
pure strategy, luck and speed. So without further ado... Okay. Roll. Oh, wow, that's
a lot of cameras. Alright, Jet Laggers. It all comes down to this. We have three hours
on the clock. Seven flags across the map. First to four wins. Ready for this? Alright, let's do it. Three... two... one... go! Alright, Scotty.
You always go on the wrong side of the camera!
Sorry! Okay, Ben. Okay, I think we should—
I think we should go— One of us should go north.
One of us should go south. Well, yeah, there's
not as much south though. I'm gonna go north
to this guy, I think. I'm gonna go south. Okay, sounds good,
sounds good. There's this one north. Maybe I should go run for that, 'cause I could run it
back over the line. Okay.
What do you think? I think that sounds good. Are we gonna try and plan any defense right now? I mean, you could play defense. Do you think it's worth you
playing defense at this point? Seeing how that works? I think so.
You could base— Well, you can wait here and
see what they do in five minutes. It's worth trying
both strategies. Yeah. And then we'll get a
sense of which works, yeah. Yep, see ya. I'm gonna try to
Keihin–Tōhoku to Ōmiya. Keihin–Tōhoku, here we go. Yep. I don't see anybody getting on this. Okay, 7:12.
Trackers just turned on. JK 27. Where are they?
The doors on the right side will open. I think Adam's
on my same train. Oh shoot,
is Sam on this train? It looks like Sam's on this train. Okay, I haven't seen
Sam or Scotty yet. This is— Oh, I forgot. It's rush hour in Tokyo. It's gonna be cozy. We're going down to
Shimbashi Station, and then we're
transferring to a Metro. I haven't really even
taken Metros much yet, so I kind of don't
know how to do that, but we'll figure it out, right? Okay, so Ben has gone south. Oh, I bet he's going to
Tokyo Tower. Let's go there. Yamanote Line... Right here, perfect! Oh god, talk about ideal! Now I have to
transfer to the Ginza Line and ride that straight
towards the flag. Yes, okay. Okay, Ben's
somewhere near here. Trying to track him
down and tag him. Okay, Scotty's
heading towards me. So I'm gonna have to keep
my eyes peeled for him, because we can both
tag each other. So I'm gonna have to
be as close to me. I'm gonna have to
be ready to get him. Okay, he got on the train. Gotta figure this out now. How do I get to that train? Yeah, it's rush— Oh, I gotta get on that train. Okay, I'm on the right train. Yeah, same train. Has to be. I think he's up there. Adam's definitely
on my same train. I'm gonna try to nab him
at the other station. I'm trying to see if
he comes after me. Trying to stake him out. Where is he? He's out on the street. It's just up here. Just to the left. He's right up here. I gotta figure out
what it looks like. Come on. Where is it? This way? This way? Yes, yes. Here. Okay. He's less than a block away. I like this spot. I got shields on both sides. I don't even know
what's in this thing. There we go. (flap rattling) Okay, he's right here. Gonna hide. Gonna hide back here. He knows I have it. He knows I have the flag,
'cause you have to notify. Oh, he retrieved the weird one. Okay. He should be at the
end of this block. Where is he? He's right here. I'm just gonna
kind of move around, try to shake him out of his spot. I don't see him. I think I just gotta
make a run for it. Okay, back streets. Got him. Got him. See you, sucker! Oh (bleep), you got me? I got you, it's in the text. Sumimasen. Oh, he got me from behind. Damn, that sucks. Damn! Bad freaking start. Okay, he's just
getting to the station now. And I'm one stop behind him. So as soon as this stops, I'll get off and go chase. I just need to figure
out how to get out of here as quickly as possible. Scotty's right on top of me. So I gotta run. If he pops out of
this train place, I gotta be prepared... to get his ass. He hasn't gotten very far. Let's do it. I just don't wanna
get ambushed here. I'm really worried he's
hiding behind something. (panting heavily) Yeah, shoot. Either the tracker
was inaccurate, or... ...he faked me out. We gotta run. Ooh, my legs are sore! Okay, I made it to the machine. Please. (bottle drops) (coins clattering) Okay. (flap rattling)
Ugh. Pain is only temporary. Winning is forever. Oh my god. (flap rattling) Okay. Okay, we've got the flag. There's a subway ahead of me. So I won't have to head
back towards Scotty. Hopefully we can make it out. Gotta be careful. He can still ambush me here. Oh, there he is, I see him. (panting) Okay, I'm gonna... I just gotta get a good picture. He's running. I just have to figure
out my way back. I saw him, but I
couldn't get a picture in time. That's the train! This train! Oh! Okay, it left. Oh! (bleep), okay.
I have to wait for the next one. Have to hide here. Oh, he's right on top of me. Okay. Gonna have my camera ready. Somewhere here. Where the (bleep) is it? (sigh) What the hell? Here, not it. Okay, can't run inside now. That's my train. I just can't let Scotty get me. If I can get onto this train,
I'm home free with this flag. Sumimasen, sumimasen. Just have to obscure myself. (exhausted breathing) Please leave. It's not him. Ah, crap! I bet he got on this train. Dang it. Okay, this train
is going the right way. So I think I'm
home free with this. (whispering) Let's (bleep) go.
Let's (bleep) go. Alright, it looks like Adam's
heading back to Tokyo Station, and I don't think I can catch him. So I think I probably need
to take the time advantage to grab another flag. I think I'm gonna go
for this flag. I like the look of it. Alright, time's up, let's go. Almost there. Few more blocks. Once I cross this street... Done. Woo! Alright, let's go
after the next one. Man, he already
returned that flag. Almost within the
five-minute window, wow. Headed for the subway. Heading up towards the
two northern flags. Basically, at this point,
I'm gonna see what Sam does. Base my decision off of that. Here's a station. Heading north, Ginza Line. Asakusa. Apparently Ben
got the slip on Scotty. This is not going great! Alright. I made it back. Tokyo Station, flag scored. But actually this train goes
straight back towards Sam. So I'm gonna just hop on it
and try and defend against him. Yeah, it goes straight to Sam. So I'm gonna go for him. Alright, we got two flags down.
They've got none. I'm feeling good. Alright. Flag is just over there.
I see it. It's really hard to tell
what Adam's up to. His tracker's not very accurate. I don't know if he's coming after me
or going for another flag. Need more useful info. Okay. So I've decided I'm
gonna go for both flags. There's one at Ueno.
I'm gonna get that. I'm gonna get back on this... Continue on,
get the next one... Then head back, and then... That would be four. So... Alright. Alright, let's get outta here. Sumimasen! Exit for Ueno Park, yep. Tokyo? Okay. Arigatō gozaimasu. Actually, you know what? I shoulda just switched to
going and getting a flag. Okay, I'm going to Tokyo Tower. This is saying I should walk. Oh, okay. Yeah, let's do that. Oh crap. Oh crap! I got directions
from the wrong place. Ugh! 'Cause my location sucks. Major self-own here. Okay. Let's get back on it. Wrong way. Oh, this light is killing me. Oh, I need cash,
I need cash, I need cash! Okay. Got! Okay, doesn't look like
Adam's coming after me, so I think I'm somewhat safe. Okay, Sam has
retrieved a flag. But... I'm about to retrieve
another one, so... Still have the advantage. How do I get outta here? Exit, Ueno Park. Yeah! Ueno Park, okay. Okay. It's like a quarter mile. Where's Sam? Because... I think the smart thing
for him to do is come after me. I think I need
to return this flag... and then we need to go
high risk, high reward. We need to go defensive.
We need to block them. You know, steal flags from them. I think that's our best shot
at this point. Yeah, obviously. There it is, yes! Okay. Fine, coins. Okay, coins, coins, coins. There we go, there we go. Got it. Okay. Alright, put this in the bag. Then let's boogie. Okay. I think the move now... straight to the far flag. Let's get there. Nakamise. Yes. Okay. Let's do it. Where's Sam? Says he's pretty far from me. So... Hopefully I can get on the subway. Ugh. (moan) Adam retrieved another flag. I don't like this! Sam's tracker bubble
is just way too big. I'll never know
what train he's on, and they're all too crowded. I'm going back.
I'm just gonna go for a flag. Okay, I actually
didn't realize until the last second
that I was back, but I scored this.
That's great. Oh, Sam got a flag, good. Okay, we're still
in this to win it. (growls softly) Yeah. Oh, I got on the wrong train. Dang it. Okay. Alright. Back to that same line. I'm gonna go get a third flag. And if I can return those... That's four, we win. But it's risky. 'Cause if I get caught, I'll be handing them over. I'm gonna go see
if I can cut Adam off. Now I'm navigating the
maze of Tokyo Station when I try to find
a train up to Adam. Sumimasen. Sumimasen. Okay, it doesn't know
where Sam is anymore. I don't love that. No idea where Sam is. Alright. Three stops. Just trying to find the platform. Where am I on? Oh, interesting. Adam seems to be
going for a twofer. Okay, that changes the plan. Let's take a look. Unfortunately, he has
a lot of routes back. Here we go. Let's get out. Get the fourth flag. Then if I can get back,
I'm golden. And I have a lot of ways out. Got a lot of ways out. Should be just up here. Blue vending machine on the left. Oh, this is a temple.
I'm gonna be very careful. I wanna be very respectful here. Can't go under that,
is my understanding. Oh, there it is. Okay. Here we go. (coin drops) (bottle drops) Alright, shopping street
flag retrieved. If I can just get back
safely, that's it. Doesn't look like Sam
is near me right now. Adam's got two flags, so I'm just gonna
try and box Sam out. 'Cause Sam's gonna have
to go defend against Adam. So I'm here, Sam's here at
Tokyo Station, Adam's up here. So maybe I should get
more in-between them. How do I do that? Maybe go to Kanda. Alright, let's figure out
how to get there. Okay. Adam retrieved the flag. Now I need to monitor which
train station he goes into to hopefully figure out
where I need to cut him off. The problem is he has
multiple options back. And one of the options doesn't
even come to Tokyo Station. It comes to a Metro station that's on kind of the
outside of the neutral zone. So I need to be kind of ready
to run over to that line. And it seems like that's
what he's gonna do. Here's the deal. I'm here in Kanda. If Adam makes it
back to Tokyo Station with these two flags, we win. Sam's gonna go to
defend against him. But, if I wait here, I can block Sam from defending
against him, hopefully. If Sam comes this way, I can try and get on
his train and tag him. At the very least,
it should slow him down or make his routes
more complicated so that Adam has more time
to get back to Tokyo Station. That's the plan. Ben is posted
up at Kanda Station, which is where I was gonna go... presumably to nab me
if I go for that route. So I think that makes me think that
Adam's gonna take the Metro route. Maybe, I don't know. Or it's trying to be a fake-out. I'm gonna go on foot. I think there's a spot from which
I'll be able to run to either line and hopefully cut 'em off
outside of the neutral zone. Alright, this
is the key moment. Let's plan an escape route. Hey buddy. Hello? Hello?
Alright, I have a few options. Yeah, hey, hey, you hear me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have a few
options back, okay? Now the trouble is I think if I take the
most direct option back, they'll be able to identify
it easily and get me. But if I go to Ueno...
Yeah. There are multiple lines back, and it may be hard for him to
figure out which one I'm on. If I get on... Oh, oh, oh, Ben! (cackles) I got it. Okay, I'm all set. Okay, bye, bye!
Bye, bye-bye-bye. Gettin' my jog in. Alright, I'm getting
to kind of the midpoint between the two lines
that Adam could take back. Hopefully I'll have enough time
to get to either of the lines... after finding out hopefully
which line he is taking. Okay, I'm going to Ueno,
'cause I gotta defend Adam there. If Sam goes there and
tries to block him, I've gotta get Sam. Alright, here we go! One last run,
if I can just get to Ueno. I don't see Scotty anywhere. Yeah, Scotty's off in
the middle of nowhere. Scotty's actually down here. He just retrieved this flag
and is on his way to return it. That'll put both teams
at two flags, which means it'll all
come down to this. If Adam can score the
two flags in his possession, they win the game. But if I can find a way
to stop him before he gets back to
Tokyo and steal the flags, we'll also seal the deal. Alright, here we go. Right one out. If I can get on this train,
and it leaves... I'm home free. Looks like Ben
went up to Ueno. Ben is smart. Okay, what is the fastest
way I can get to... somewhere between
here and Ueno? So I figured out that almost every
single one of Adam's routes back went through here, Kanda. So I went on a train
to intercept him. But on the way,
I realized something. They can take a
zero-stop Shinkansen from Ueno Station
back to Tokyo Station. Zero stops means
zero chance to catch them. If they realize that too... we're screwed. Alright, well I made it to Kanda. Maybe I can intercept them. But to be honest... if they figured out
the Shinkansen thing, there's nothing I can do. There it is. Alright. Sumimasen. (softly) It's leaving. It's leaving. Yes. (whispers) Let's (bleep)-ing go.
There it is, baby. Looks like they're
moving pretty fast. They're just about
to pass through here. But it does not look
like on a local train. Alright, alright. I'm closing the windows. Very smooth. Oh, yeah. What is this flag? These are— I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, it is frankly a refreshing
blend of sweet and tangy. Oh, oh. Ben, Ben, Ben. Alright.
Alright. Wait.
One. And that is GG. Let's go see Sam and Scotty. Let's go see our friends. Alright, oop. They got it. Well played. Well played. Sam just texted
back a frowny face. Yeah, he should be
frowny facing right now. He said "":( on Shinkansen?"" Yep.
Yep. We're both so wet right now. Well, Japan...
this has been incredible. Probably the most fun I've
ever had playing Jet Lag. I'll say already,
I'm sure we'll be back. There they are. Hey buddy. Congrats, guys. Thank you. Ohh! There he is. Scotty Strange Parts. I don't—
I'm so sorry. You deserve to win so much. You put in the work. Thank you. They strategized
that really well. They, you know—
It was beautiful. This was an absolute pleasure. Thank you for having me on. You were a great partner.
This country's amazing. The trains are great.
This is incredible. The game was awesome. And yeah, what a great game.
You guys developed a really amazing
Oh, thank you. ...game for this round,
for this season. Yeah, this was a lot of fun. But here they are. Well done. Well played. Formidable opponents.
Go in for a hug. I'm really sweaty.
That's very sweaty hug. So I don't know if you realize
exactly how close that was. I saw you and could not
get a photo of you. Oh my god!
(laughs heartily) And you were
sprinting full-speed. Yeah.
You did it. I finally did it. I'm so proud
of you that you ran. Alright, gentlemen. Congratulations. The victors of
Jet Lag season six. Thank you, Sam.
Yay! Well done, guys.
Woo! I do have something for you. Oh, what could it be? What could it be? But it was actually
for the first time ever, too big for me to
carry with me. Oh, wow.
Wow. I actually need
to call in air support. Oh my god. What does that even mean? Just watch. Here, look behind you. Oh my god! What the hell?! What is that? It's coming down. Whooaa! It's a huge thing! You ready, one, two, three!
It's so heavy. (both grunting) (both cheering) Hey, Scotty. Hey, Scotty. How are you feeling? Tired. Yeah, I imagine you
might be feeling tired. But is there any sort of
more specific way you would maybe put it? Um... I think I'm feeling satisfied. This is... Okay, well, yes, well—
And that's lovely, Scotty. That's great, but—
Yeah. Sort of, you know,
you were on a plane here. And you know, maybe you
haven't completely adjusted. I know what
you want me to say, which is that I'm jet lagged. (boys shouting) He said the thing! Oh my god! See you in season seven! See you in season seven! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Thank you so much for
watching for this entire season all the way to the finale. This season was truly
one of my favorite, if not my favorite ever,
to make. It was so much fun. And I hope that reflects
in the show itself and how it came out. We can't wait to bring
you the next season. But until then... we are keeping up with
our podcast, for example, through the entire offseason. Making episodes every
single week for y'all. Yeah, so, you know,
like in the last offseason: We did a travel tips special. We did a whole
game design special where we looked back at how
we designed all of the games. I think that this offseason, we might do recaps
of earlier seasons before we had the podcast. There might be, you know,
some sneak peeks of what the next season could be. You know, there's a lot of
fun stuff on the podcast. But also, don't miss the
wrap-up of this season. We've got a whole episode where
now that the whole season's done, Ben and I can revel in our victory
in Sam and Scotty's faces. We could also talk about
how we designed that final round tiebreaker. And the whole thing because—
And the whole thing, yeah. It was one of the toughest
game design challenges I think we've had.
It was, yeah. So we're able to look back
on the whole season now and do this big wrap-up, which you can listen to
exclusively on Nebula. And while you're waiting
for the next season to come out, there's so much other great
stuff to watch on Nebula. I mean, at this point, we should
for sure plug Scotty's channel. If you aren't familiar with
Strange Parts, definitely go check it out.
There is so— He does these amazing things where he goes to these
electronics markets in Shenzhen and he buys all these parts
and he makes these amazing— like he modifies iPhones to do all these things
that iPhones can't do. I love his channel. I've watched his channel for
years and I was so excited. I remember wa— His very first video
was such a good video that I actually can remember
watching it five years ago. Yeah. And so it's crazy
that we've now done a whole season of
Jet Lag with him. It's amazing.
Yeah, it's super exciting. And he has, on Nebula, an exclusive tour of his
workshop, which is amazing. He takes you through
his whole workshop. So jealous of it. Shows you all
of his equipment. It's an awesome way
to spend an hour, and it will make you
very jealous. But that's something you
can only watch on Nebula. Yeah, I mean,
Nebula really is like— The entire idea behind Nebula
is you have these creators that have proven that they
know how to make good content, because they've built
these audiences on YouTube that really enjoy
watching what they make. And they've managed to do all
this on a pretty tight budget. I mean, you never have that
big of a budget on YouTube, and you have to command
the same audiences that can watch stuff with
million-dollar budgets. So it makes sense that
if you just give these creators a little bit more budget, they're able to make
stuff that's a lot better, even than the stuff that
people already love on a platform like YouTube. So that's the idea
behind Nebula Originals, and we have so many
of them these days. And honestly, a lot of times, it's like these creators have been
wanting to make these projects, but they just haven't
had the funding for it. So it's like their
dream passion projects. So I think that's
why a lot of times, almost all the time,
they're just excellent. Even if it's not the kind of
thing that you wanna watch. Like I remember going
into the premiere for The Prince by Abigail Thorn. It's like a Shakespearean
multiverse kind of play. And I didn't think that
was gonna be my thing, but I went to the premiere 'cause I'm always
up for a good party, and I walked away, blown away. It was so good. And I think what
made it better was that it was actually something
that I didn't maybe think I was gonna enjoy. That wasn't really the kind
of thing for me in advance. Similar deal when I
went to the premiere of Night of the Coconut
by Patrick Willems. To be honest, I hadn't really
watched his channel much. But went to the premiere, and it was weirdly also
a kind of multiverse thing. It was so good. I enjoyed that more
than so many feature films I go watch by super
acclaimed directors, but it was so good,
and it was a Nebula Original, and you can only
watch it on Nebula. That's the deal with so much. So it's really the best
ways to fill your Wednesdays now that we're in the off-season,
aside from the podcast, of course. The good news is it really
doesn't take much to get access to all of this, because when you sign
up with our code, nebula.tv/jetlag, you'll get $20 off an
annual subscription, which makes it come down to
two and a half dollars a month. So that's like half of a latte. If it's an expensive latte. If— Well, a New York City
latte's definitely $5. Well, a New York City latte
is certainly at least $5 or more. But, so it's just, don't drink
six New York City lattes, and you'll get a year of all
of this, which is awesome. I think it's a great deal, and all of that helps
support the creators, since we actually get a
portion of your subscription fee when you sign up, so yeah. Click button on screen
or in the description to sign up. And we'll see you
one week earlier than the YouTube
audience for next season. Bye, everyone!"

to episode six of our four-day game of
Capture the Flag across Japan. We're now approaching
the end of day three. Having lost the first two rounds, Scotty and I are desperate
to win round three, whose three points
would tie the game and force a fourth
sudden death round. So far, things are
going moderately well. Last episode,
I was stopped by Adam on my way back to return
the mid-field flag, which sucked for me,
but didn't suck quite as much as Ben getting caught less than
a mile from his mid-field flag by a sideways-running Scotty, putting my team in the lead
if this round ties, as tied rounds are
won by whichever team has transported unscored flags
the furthest distance. Something Adam,
who was escorting me back to my jail period at Tokyo Station, was not thrilled about. That sucks. Yeah, that does suck. It's gonna take him a
while to get back to Tokyo. Ohhh, that sucks. 'Cause it puts you guys
in the lead. Yeah. Because you've transported a flag... Yeah. ...some distance,
and Ben has not. Shoot. Well done, good sir. Jesus Christ. That was a heck of a chase. It is very scary to have a
man running at you sideways all over town while you're
desperate to get pizza. I've gotten
so many weird looks. I know. Well, I'm back to Tokyo. Just for the
sake of the segment, we need to do a little
sideways walking together. Okay. Oh yeah, this is not pleasant. Yeah. I'm not gonna do this anymore,
'cause I don't have to. Oh, I do have to do—
Goddammit. Yeah, you do have to. That's unfortunate.
I'll see you at the station. Yeah. Good bye, Adam. Gotta get out so
I can do challenges. Keihin–Tōhoku,
Keihin–Tōhoku, oh. Here we go. 20 minutes left
in the day here. Try and knock out a challenge. Good shuffle. Catch a Pokémon. Purchase anything with an
image of a Pokémon on it. You must clearly identify
what Pokémon it is. You may not use your phone
to research the location of any stores that may
have Pokémon. Alright, catch Pokémon. Alright, that should
not be too hard. I've seen a lot of
Pokémon around. Pokémon, Pokémon, Pokémon. ♪ Pokémon, gotta catch 'em— ♪ ♪ It's you and me ♪ No, none of these magazines
have Pokémon on them. They seem to mostly have
sort of scantily clad women. That is not a Pokémon. ♪ I know it's my destiny ♪ None of these are Pokémon. ♪ —Teach me, and I'll teach— ♪ Seems there's not really
any Pokémon— Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo. Oh, that's a Pokémon
right there, baby. This is Miraidon. I bet I can prove it
in just a second. Miraidon. Yeah, this is Miraidon. Arigatō gozaimasu. I have bought this thing
with a Pokémon on it. Challenge complete, boom. Ready, and... Show off your chopstick skills. Transport 30 grains of rice,
one at a time, from one container to
another with chopsticks. If you drop any,
you must start over. Okay. I think I can also do this. No problem. Rice, rice, rice, rice. Cups. Chopsticks. Arigatō gozaimasu. Let's do this thing. One... in, easy. 30. (sigh) Done.
Challenge complete. That was annoying,
but I got a lot of coins. So I'm cool with it. Alright, the day ends
in one minute. But that's enough time for me
to just draw the next challenge. And, you know,
I'll do it in the morning. Eat wagyu. You may eat any amount
of wagyu. You may not eat raw meat. Anything labeled as
wagyu counts. Ugh. (sigh) Okay, well... That might be hard in
the morning at 7 am. Good night, see you in the
morning at this exact spot. Now, it's the rest period. Everyone stops what they're
doing for the night, goes to bed, and we start back where we were
at 7 am the next day. Scotty and Ben are still on
their pretty long journey back to Tokyo Station. So they won't be
back in the game until a little ways into tomorrow. Until they get back,
it's just Adam trying to earn enough coins to
make a run for the far flag, and me trying to stop him. Alright, 7 am. Name of the game today: the best offense is a good defense. Here's the thing, if this round
were to end right now, we would win, 'cause we
have the distance advantage. We've transported our
second flag further. Our best path to victory
we think at this point is to just shut down
their offensive runs. Both Scotty and I,
just doing everything possible to tag and prevent them from
moving their flag, even a little bit. But we think we can do that. So that's what we're gonna try. Alright, 7 am, let's go.
We gotta find wagyu. Ooh, okay. Okay, four minutes away. Could work. Alright, which way? This way, alright. It's gonna be interesting
to see what Sam does, if he tries to
come after me or not. If he does come after me, I'm gonna drop my
Vampire Tower here. Oh yeah, by the way, Adam drew a Vampire Tower
way back yesterday, but we lost the footage. But yeah, he has a
Vampire Tower, which means if I'm
in its radius, I lose 50 coins every minute. That would make it
so that he loses coins every minute he's in here,
which should probably scare him off. Let's see what he does though. Adam's down in Shimbashi. Let's see if we can go grab him. This place is open, and I
think it does actually have wagyu. Hi. Wagyu? Wagyu.
Wagyu. Okay, how does this work? Sumimasen. Ah. Wagyu, yes. Okay, it looks like
Sam is coming for me. Trapping. Leave, leave. Get scared and leave. Get scared and leave. Get scared and leave. Arigatō gozaimasu. Alright, Adam just
dropped a Vampire Tower. So every minute
I'm here, I lose 50 coins. I have 250, so I can
have five minutes, but the balance is also
allowed to go negative. And I'm not sure I need coins
for the rest of the day, so I'm still gonna go after him. The thing is, all I need to do
today is just waste Adam's time. I don't even need budget. This is fine. Alright, he's somewhere
around the streets here. (huff) Okay, come on. Leave, leave! It looks like he's still here. Okay, he's here. I have to go. Just gonna leave money here. Adam, I'm coming for you! I've caught up a good bit. He's just a couple blocks ahead. He is coming for me. Fine, whatever. I'll run to Shinagawa, if that's really what he wants. If I keep him in here
long enough... there's no way he'll ever
be able to make a run. I can do this all day. I'm in no rush. Adam is. He must just be
trying to slow me down. I guess it's working. Alright, I'm only
a block away. Getting close! Alright, I got some
good distance on him now. Okay. Wagyu. Let's try for grocery store. Grocery nearby. Closed, I need 'em open. Cheap groceries aren't gonna do it. Okay, I've got a little
bit of space here. There he is. Oh, what? Adam! The tracker was wrong. Ah, it always is, isn't it? I think I'm probably gonna go. (exhales weakly) So I'll see you back
at Tokyo Station? Another round? (bleep) Alright. Quickest way out is over here. Okay, I gotta race back to... Tokyo Station. That was really bad! Here's Adam. Yeah.
Never trust the tracker. Adam's 30-minute,
what are we calling it? Freeze or jail? It's a jail period. Okay. Why do you think they have their
science projects in the window? Now I get it, okay. So you guys' plan... is just double defense
and run out the clock. I 'unno. Okay, okay. Interesting. Today on Choo Choo Chew... we have Pocari Sweat. Terrible name, amazing drink. How would you
describe it to someone who's never had
Pocari Sweat before? (wheezes) Hey, Scotty. Yo! Well, I'm feeling pretty good, because somehow,
Adam was able to get— Adam's challenge pull luck
seemingly has been really good. He had 2,000 coins on him. Oh my god! A little bit more than 2,000. So I figure I pull a tower now, to just lock in that budget, because I might go back
into the Vampire zone. But I don't ha—
I can go negative all day if I'm not going offensive again. I think the reality of our strategy
is setting in with Adam. He kind of realized on our
walk back to the station what we were kind of up to. I think we need to
be prepared for that. So I'm thinking maybe you
should come back into Tokyo for maximum flexibility. Yeah. Because we can just
follow them all day. Shuffle, shuffle,
shuffle, shuffle. Oh, Vampire Tower. Vampire Tower. Every minute that your
opponents are in this area, they lose 50 coins. Balance can go negative. That could be useful. Adam's talking to the camera, and he's not letting me
come close. I bet it's something like,
""This sucks."" (sighs) Well, that was
very disappointing. I think the only thing I can
do now is try to earn coins. (sigh) I don't know. See if I can find a mall
in the Vampire zone, where he'd never
be able to find me. I'm in full understanding
of how annoying our strategy is. But it is our best strategy,
so I kind of have to play it. Alright, Adam's on
his way to a platform. I'm just gonna see
what train he gets on. I can't get on the same train,
but at least gives me useful intel. Yeah. Just saves me the time of having
to cross-reference on Google. I think these are too
high-frequency, Adam. You gotta go for a
lower frequency one. Shut up! Alright, see you in a bit. No, you won't see me. No, sorry.
Won't see you in a bit. I believe in you. I am just gonna pop off this
train super fast for one second, so I can pull the card
and start making a plan. Right, shuffle. Card. Get at least one half mile
from your nearest 7-Eleven. While you may use transit
to get away from 7-Elevens, you may not be on transit at the
moment you complete the card. That sucks. Actually, you know what? I think I know where I can do this. I think if I go to the
middle of the park. Okay, let's run. Kinda looks like Adam
just tried to fake me out. He went one station down. But I saw that, and therefore
I didn't get on that train. That would've taken me
into the Vampire zone. So I guess I'll go
meet him outside again? Adam's right over there, but don't wanna leave him the
time to do a challenge, right? That'd be bad for me. Just gonna run. Just gonna run there. Hopefully, Sam can't get to me. But... Not taking any chances
this time. Come on, come on, come on, come on! Come on! Come on! Oh, come on. Stupid thing. Alright. Oops, drat. Sumimasen! Sumimasen! Oops! Okay. Into the park. I'mma get some exercise in. Alright, Adam's going
into the Imperial Gardens. They're very picturesque. That's where Scotty
and I drew a landscape. (distant police whistle) No? Walk? Okay. Sumimasen! I'm only allowed to walk? Speed walking. Speed walk. Getting close! It is a gorgeous day to
be running around Tokyo. This is lovely. Speed walking. Running, says you can run. It's a little sign. Alright, here we go. Wait, how do I get in? How do you get in? How do you get in? How do you get
into the park? I've gone around it,
gone around the park. Where's Sam? Almost got him, I think. Coming for you, Adam! I'm trapped. I'm trapped. I'm trapped. I'm trapped. Just gonna make
a run for it back into— There he is. I thought you said we weren't
seeing each other soon. Yeah, let's go
back to Tokyo Station. Morning, Ben. A bit of a rough
morning, huh, boys? I've had a great morning. Oy vey. You're on a killing spree, Sam. Yeah. I just needed to get
my miles in. What are you doing? I have nothing else to do. No. They're making a plan. I feel like they've gotta
start traveling together. I feel like that's their only way, so they can get
further out of Tokyo. I think we should
grind out coins together. Since Sam and Scotty can't follow us on a train, I think we should just
try and figure out what is the least frequent train
we could get out of here on? And it would be
a Shinkansen, right? Yeah, well that's
what I was saying. We should go to Shin-Yokohama. I think that that's right. We'll see if it works. Never count the boys out. Oh, just by the way,
this was so frantic, nobody explained it,
but at the last second, Ben and Adam realized
the train they wanted to get on left one minute after
Adam's jail period ended. So they had to make
a run for it. Man, this is a tight sequence. Ben, what happens if
you don't make this? Nothing! What's your platform number? Well, that's the right way. 14, 14, 14, 14, 14. That way.
No, those are the down. Up, okay, up. Oh wait, I need to get a
tight visual of Adam's face. It's important. Adam, that's your train! Sorry, guys. The next part also
got a little messy, but basically Adam and Ben
decided to hop on a local line to the neutral zone in
Shinagawa, where they could catch
the next Shinkansen, popping out at a stop
along the way to draw a card, which was: Visit any museum. Any establishment that describes
itself as a museum counts. You must gain entry to the museum
and spend at least 15 minutes there. The 15 minutes starts once
you are inside the museum. Visit any museum. We gotta spend
15 minutes there though. Yeah, but it's 1,000 coins. Okay. Could be worse. Then they made
their way to Shinagawa, where they met a
certain special someone, finally arriving from Kōfu. Oh! Hello, gentlemen! Hey, Scotty. It's great to see you.
I haven't seen you all in a while. I mean, this is a
safe zone, obviously. As you know.
It is. I do. But I was thinking it
might be useful to know where
you're headed next. I don't like what's happening. (laughs heartily) This does make
things a little sticky. You said you had to
go to the bathroom, right? I do.
Alright, go for it. Do you wanna
know why I'm waiting? I think—
Turn that way. I'm gonna trade off.
I'm gonna go pee. And then I'll catch up
with you guys in a minute. The boys are back in town. That's so true about
the boys being back in town. That's a really good point, buddy. I don't like that you
know what our plan is, 'cause it's the only viable plan. It's gonna work
this time though. Don't look at
my phone screen, okay? We are winning, alright? Don't condescend to us. Yeah, I wanna point out
how smug they're being about the chance that
Yeah, about having lost— they could get a tie.
Yeah. They're so proud of themselves that maybe they could tie us. Who won round one?
Us. Who won round two?
Also us, alright? So why don't we
keep that in mind?! The main thing I'm happy about is minimizing the chances of an awfully embarrassing
three-round sweep. It's gonna happen. And when it happens, it is
gonna be awfully embarrassing. And it's gonna be
awesome when it does. It's not 'our' train. You can't get on it. Alright, this your train? There are no museums
near Shin-Yokohama. So we are gonna have
to go all the way. That's okay. But fortunately there's a
museum right next to the station. There's one
right next to Odawara. They are going to get... to Odawara... Wait, what? Wait, the Hikari goes to Odawara? Oh. There was another train. Well, let's see where they are. When would they have
to get on that? (grimaces internally) When would they have
to get on that? Where's this going? No, it's Hikari.
We can get on this one. Oh. Let's do that! I guess let's do that. That's going
the right way, right? Yeah, Shin-Yokohama. Yeah, great. Oh.
Awesome. I almost feel bad. I feel bad too. Oh no-o-o-o... I didn't realize
that went to Odawara. There was another train. There was another train. There was another
train that goes to— Folks, there was another train. There was another train,
and it leaves right now. So we might— Our margin is what? I mean our—
There is no— Our margin is six minutes. That's not a lot of minutes. How far behind are we? Five minutes?
Eight minutes, I think. Yeah, okay.
No, six minutes. Six minutes
Six minutes behind. I don't... We don't have a lot of options. I don't know what to do, Ben. Well, are they—
Okay, maybe this is crazy. Maybe the move is to get
caught as quickly as possible so that we can start
a new challenge that's not gonna
absolutely screw us. 'Cause what are our
chances of getting it? Well, we could get in there, and then if once it's
complete after 15 minutes, we could pull a tower, and
maybe then, we could get out. I'm just saying we
don't have a lot of time... to get, you know... We could try to hide
in the museum. I mean... Let's just try it. Let's just try it.
We'll pull a tower. It's worth a try, right? I can't believe there was one,
six minutes after. Why does Japan
have such frequent trains? Japan, make your
trains worse, please. Unfortunately,
Ben, we do have to run. I'm ready. Every minute matters, 'cause we have a six-minute
margin as mentioned. We are not allowed
to hide in bathrooms, but we're allowed to hide in
any other reasonable place. (chime tones) Alright, let's go. Yeah, come on, come on. Exit, exit... This way. Sumimasen. Sumimasen. How do we get
out of this place? Okay, here we go. If this way was east,
this way has to be south. You got it, pal.
You got it. I don't know how you
can go downstairs so fast. Alright. Alright, alright, alright. Let's do this thing. Done it twice.
Here we come, boys. Let's do it a third time. You let me know
what speed you want to go. Okay. I'm going
as fast as I can. That's alright. Oh, you okay? Just do your best! Ohh. Look, we're 300 meters
from the museum. I think that we are most
likely going to be able to make it in there. And then it's all about hiding. This is pretty, look at this. Oh my gosh.
Look at that, Ben. I think that's the castle. Yeah, that's the castle. They're at a castle. I wonder if it's
a touristy castle. Okay. Maybe I should do a speedrun. Yeah. That sounds good. Have fun. Alright, we're almost there. We're only 100 meters
away, Ben. This is a very small museum. We're totally screwed. Hi. Two. Sumika. Sorry, cash only. Cash?
Cash. I have cash. Thank you very much. Arigatō gozaimasu.
Arigatō gozaimasu. Back in running mode. They're right up there. ♪ (solemn piano) This is just it. It's one room. There's a...
room with a screen. Can we hide behind these screens? (whispering)
It's totally inappropriate. It seems a little gauche. Only the case, the best we can
do is hiding behind this wall. And cash only. Oh, cash only. Thank you. Here you are.
Thank you. Hi. Is there—
I'm looking for my friends. Oh, friends? Yes.
Friends? Yeah, two other Americans. Are they— American... (speaking Japanese) Is this the whole area? Oh, down here you think? Check the tower.
Oh, tower? Oh, over there. Okay, thank you. I can't find them. It seems like they're
somewhere in this museum. Which'd make sense 'cause
there's a museum challenge. I don't see them. Ice Tower. Opponents must roll a die in
their hands to walk in this area. Every time they roll a number,
they may walk that many steps. They just dropped an Ice Tower. So we have to roll a die
to walk in this region. Three, four. Three... six. Two, three, four. Thank you. I don't understand. It shows them here. Oh, finally.
(spurts laugh) I bet that was real
funny when I came in. Well, 'cause there
were guys there. I didn't want to turn my
flashlight on and disturb them. Well, I just came from outside. I was completely blind. Ugh. I thought— I came back,
'cause I was like, I knew that's something
that they would do. You saw,
I turned my flashlight on. They were there and
I was like, ""Oh, sorry."" You looked that way. Yeah. Alright, back to Tokyo.
That was funny. That was funny.
At least we got that. Alright, see ya. You still have to
roll dice to walk in here. Don't forget that. Yeah. Arigatō gozaimasu. Is the train back
to Tokyo in nine minutes? I think we can make that,
and they can't. I mean, maybe that'll
buy us some time. One, two, three,
four, five. One, two, three. Man, this dice roll curse sucks. Probably means that
Ben and Adam are gonna get back to Tokyo
way earlier than us. Well... We're gonna have to
figure out a new plan. One, two, three. Looks like it's
your first day walking. You're just getting the hang of it. I've gotten
so many dirty looks. Fairly certain I got
shamed in Japanese. A man wanted me to go in
front of him on the escalator, and I was like, ""No, you
really don't want that."" Well, Ben... Things have not been
going well today. Nope. We are back at Tokyo Station,
back at square one. One, two, three, four. I have enough
budget to pull a tower. Yeah? And pretty much, I think
it just makes sense to do whenever we have the budget
to do it today, right? You wanna make a pull? Sure. Odd Tower. Opponents may only take
trains scheduled to leave at odd-numbered times
in this area. The number is determined
by its final digit. Odd Tower. Oh, we already
had one of those. We already had one of those.
Well, it is pretty useful. We're closing on Shinagawa. Do you think I should
get off there? Well, so I have
zero coins right now. Yeah.
So I think— And we've got that
Vampire Tower. So I think I continue on
to Tokyo Station at least. But you've still got coins. Yeah. So I think you stop here. No sense in us being in
the same spot, really. Yeah, no. Alright, so I'll get off here.
And then let's— It's an easy bounce
between Tokyo Station and here. Yeah, it takes
four minutes, yeah. Alright, so yeah. We'll coordinate a bit
once we see what they do. So we've been doing
some math. Even though Scotty has
abandoned the second flag, there's basically no
way for us to get there and get it back in time,
because all of the lines are much slower. You would have
to go the long way up, and I don't think that— It would be two hours
after the game ended that we could get it
over the line. The better move is
to go for the far flag, and just, if we can get it, I think Sam managed to
transport his second flag 40 miles back.
So if we could get more than 40 miles back,
we would win in a tie. That's all we need to do. So, like maniacs, I think we're basically just
hopping back on the train back to where we just were... and trying again. Well... Yeah. Yeah. But there's a tower there now, and we might pull a
better challenge, and... That's true, don't forget—  didn't even think about that. There's a tower there.
There is a tower there. So that's actually a really
good area to do challenges now. We're going back to Odawara. Can't resist that Samurai Museum. Although hopefully we're not
going back to the Samurai Museum. Okay, come on, let's go. Okay, now I need to
figure out where Ben and Adam are, and hopefully figure out what
train they're gonna get on here. You know what, I'm just
gonna go back up onto the Shinkansen platform. I think it's very possible
they're up there. Yep, there they are. Hi guys!
Where are you going? Hi, Scotty. Good bye. Good bye. We're doing the
very predictable thing and getting on this train.
Good bye now. Hey, I just
caught up with them. They're on the Kodama
723 to Shin-Ōsaka. Leaving at 11:57, and it
stops at all stations. Alright, well, let's look
for the next one after that. Okay, hello.
Hi. Basically, this is
our last opportunity. Yeah, if we don't time
everything perfectly on this run and do it successfully, then... Yeah, if we get caught again,
then the round's over. It's game over. We need to earn... a total of just under
3,000 coins in order to get
all the way to the flag. But that's total, so 1,500 each. And we would need
to get on a train at either 1:01 or 1:05. Now, all of this assumes that we also don't
get caught somehow. I would say that our odds of doing
all those things are not great. But we are gonna try. Nom. Sam's figured
it out already. 12:03, just in seven minutes... on platform 14. 511, I think it's already here. It's the one that's
boarding right now. Hello, Scotty. Hello, sir. Seems like they might be
doing the same thing again. I think so.
Yeah. They might not
have a lot of options. No. Is there any
escape from there that doesn't involve coming
back to that platform? No. Okay, so I— Yeah, so I figure one of us
can just post at the platform. The other applies a little pressure. Yeah. Alright. Alright, here we go. Challenge time. Do 100 squats. Your thighs must go to an
approximately 90 degree angle to the ground for each squat. You may take as many
breaks as you wish. If done as a team, the 100 squats
may be split between teammates. Well... Okay, this, that's— You know what, that's— It could be worse. We only have to do
100 squats total. One. Two. Alright, looks like
we're going back to Odawara. So we need to get off and transfer. Right, 'cause
this is an Express. Yeah.
Will not stop at Odawara. Yep. So it buys 'em a little
more time than last time. It buys 'em about 30 minutes, but the next train that
they can take out of there would be the one that we
would be on anyway, so... I'm not worried about it.
Yeah. 13... 14... 15, starting to feel it. 16. 32. Okay, I need a little break.
I'm at 32. Ooh. Oh, it's burning. 33. 34. 40, I'm at 40. 43. 50, oh, I'm done. And I want credit.
You did your 50? Wait, wait, let me finish.
I'm at 46. I finished them before Adam.
I want credit. 49. 50, nice. Let's pull another challenge.
Okay, good work. If we can do
one more 750, then we have enough
to make the run. Deck. Go to something interesting. Without researching on YouTube, go to something that has
a YouTube video about it with at least 100,000 views. The YouTube video's title must
either include the thing's name, or clearly be referencing
it as its main focus. If you cannot find a video
correlating to your location, you may either retry
or veto the challenge. Go to something interesting. (bleep) Let's just look at what the
top attraction is around here. The Odawara Castle, right? There was that castle. That was a big castle. That was a big old castle. I know. Oh. I know, I know, I know. But we do have to hurry.
Wait, the exit's this way. I know, buddy. We only have 30 minutes. But if we get there
and we're right, then we have enough
to make the run. Okay. So we
just chill here. Finally a new
station after our— I know, a new station that
we don't have to do something weird to walk around in.
Yeah. Let's go to this
stupid castle again. It's actually not stupid.
It's actually very cool. Oh, those squats make
the running so much harder. Let me see. Is this where we turned? Yeah, yeah, we're really close. Oh god, yeah. My legs are really
feeling those squats too. Alright, we're at the castle. And so I think that means
that we can start looking. Come on. Odawara Castle. I'm not seeing a
lot of views on these. Yeah, I'm seeing
2,000 views. 494— Ooh.
Oh, oh. Did you get it? A stunning day at Odawara Castle. Life in Japan 201.
106,000 views. Thank you, Odawara Castle! Alright. Okay, Ben. We might somehow
pull this off. So we have enough
to make the run now. And now we're seeing if we
have enough to get a tower. Shuffle. Cursed! You may not advance in the game
until you have acquired a melon. If you have not acquired
a melon within 30 minutes, this curse is
automatically vetoed. Until the next time
that you are tagged, return to your zone,
or the end of the round, you must carry the melon
with you. If you draw this curse as a team, both team members
must carry a melon. Oh no. We may not advance in the game
until we've acquired a melon. If you've not acquired a
melon within 30 minutes— Okay, we need a melon asap. This was what I was afraid of. We have 16 minutes, Ben. Welcome back
to another edition of Choo Choo Chew. Choo Choo Chew! It's pickled plum. Have you ever had
pickled plum? I don't believe I
have had pickled plum. Oh, you're in for a treat. Ooh, that's moist. I guess it is pickled.
Cheers. Cheers. (stifled wheeze) If we manage
to do this, then... we would have enough
for two towers as well. My legs are so (bleep)-ed. Actually, let's
buy a tower now. Okay. Buy a tower now,
'cause we will... If we don't pull this off,
then we're (bleep)-ed anyway. So buy a tower now.
Gimme the camera. You've got the towers
in your pocket. Okay, here we go. Odd Tower. Opponents may only take
trains scheduled to leave at odd-numbered times
in this area. The number is determined
by its final digit. Odd Tower.
(gasp) That might be enough.
That might be enough. We have to see if it
leaves at an odd time. It doesn't! It doesn't! Ben, the train we need
to get on is at 1:46, which is an even number, so they
wouldn't be able to get on it. Oh my god, this might work. Oh my god, this might work. Why is—
Def— (wheezes) So... Oh, no. Palate cleanser.
This should be better. This is sheet-shaped
pickled plum. It's just the same thing. It's a different shape. Oh wow, it's like a... I'm not gonna say what
that's like actually. If this is LSD, that'd be
a wild finish to the game. (wheezes) Cheers.
Cheers. Okay, that's better. You need a few more to fully get the taste.
No. No. Oh wait, this looks
like a grocery store. No, this is a
convenience store. Okay, you don't think
they would have a melon? Okay, okay,
let's keep going then. No, I don't think
they'd have melons. Oh! That looks like a
grocery store for sure. There's definitely melons
in there. Really keep your eyes peeled. This looks promising— oh! There's produce,
Ben, there's produce. Oh, melon.
Melon. Do we both have
to get one? Yeah, we both have to get one. Okay. Okay we've acquired
the melons now. That's enough for us
to pull another tower. Yeah, pull a tower.
Okay. Gravity Tower. Opponents can only
move in this area while carrying an extra
four liters of liquid. Drop it. Yeah, yeah.
They'll have to get out. Drop it, drop it, drop it.
Okay, I'm dropping. They'll have to get out,
and then we can get on. Wait, wait, wait,
wait 'til they're here. Wait 'til they're here. Yeah, yeah,
I'm just getting my pin. They also won't be
able to tag us. Yeah. Arigatō gozaimasu. Yeah, they're almost here. So if we drop that... It's gonna force
them off their train. They won't be able to tag us until they've acquired
four liters of liquid. And then...
We'll get on their train. We'll get on their train,
and that'll continue on. And then we can transfer, and I don't even think they
could make the transfer. No. But if they can, then
we'll drop the other tower. Oh my god, this might work. Yeah, they're coming. Melon. We got— That's 2,500 total. Yeah, that's enough
for three towers. Let's just pull another one.
Alright, pull another tower. Mud Tower. All opponents
must walk sideways. What is it? Mud Tower.
It's another Mud Tower. Okay. I think we probably don't
want to use that right now. Yeah, let's save that. So, Ben... The second that it gets in... The second that it gets in... Drop the gravity tower. We need to— Well, we
need to wait a second. Let them get off, right? Wait here. Right, give them a few
seconds to get off. And look for us. So be ready to
pop out immediately, to see if we spot 'em. So we're unclear whether they're
on the Shinkansen track or not. Yeah. Let's just pop out
to see if we can spot 'em. See if we spot 'em. Okay, they're pulling in. That's the
sound of their train. Oh, I don't see 'em yet. Okay. Alright, the second
people start to come out... Now. Alright, sent. Gravity Tower's deployed. Oh, they just
hit us with something. Huh? You can't do anything
without four liters of liquid. Alright. So let's get on the train. Okay, but we
can place the tower. Let's try hitting
them with the tower. Vampire or... I don't know,
what do you think? I like them not moving. I think we should put both. Yeah, okay. Okay. Oh, no. Jail Tower.
Jail Tower. Jail Tower. Alright, start rolling. Okay. I'm getting water. We roll two dice.
Here we go. Alright, get on the train,
get on the train, get on the train. That was a close one. Just get down. I don't know if they might
have time to get the water. It's a lot of water. How much are these? These are half liters,
so I need to get eight. Okay. Just make sure they're
not on the other side. Yeah. Please go. Please tell me that they
didn't get back on it. Alright, we're moving. I don't know
if they made it on. (whispering)
Wait, stay down. They can still take a picture
of you from the train. I saw them, I saw them. Alright, four liters of water. One, two, three,
four, five. Hang on, wait for me, Sam. Yeah, I mean, they
couldn't have tagged us until they got the
four liters of water, and they clearly didn't
have them yet, so... It looks like they
both got outta here. How? I think they probably
slipped onto that Shinkansen when we weren't looking. I think while we were distracted, they probably slipped on over there. Yep. Probably maybe should
have thought of that, but I think we were probably banking
on the Jail Tower not making... you know, making it not possible. That's weird. Well, we faced— Let's figure
out our next train. Yep. Well done, Ben and Adam. I mean, they don't— There's no way they have the
budget to get all the way there. Here's the plan. I am going to chase
Ben and Adam on the next train, which arrives in a few minutes. But, we've identified
the fact that they could be actually
going after the second flag. Yeah, they
could pop out at Fuji and take the slow regional line up. That would get them
there at just past 4 pm. But I can actually
get there at 4 pm just by going back through Tokyo, which is a faster route to that. You're gonna keep chasing
them after the third flag, in case they decide to do that. They'll probably have
to stop for challenges unless they're unbelievably lucky.
I think so. So it seems like we can close
'em off from either way. Good luck, Scotty. See you hopefully...
Likewise. I'll see you for our
bonus round tomorrow. I think so.
Sudden Death, man. Yeah. It's gonna be embarrassing
though, if this ends without that. Yes. We are on our way
to hopefully victory. Yeah. So we just did the math, and it turns out we just need... not a couple
hundred more coins to make the full run
that we need to do. Yeah, it's 300-something. So we have to do one
more challenge at some point. Any challenge. So what we're gonna do
is we're just gonna pop off the train at the next stop, pull a challenge...
Yeah. And then on
our way to the flag, we're just gonna strategize
about how to do it. And hopefully it's a good one. Yeah, hopefully it's good. I mean, 'cause the thing is, if we don't go into Kōbe with a
plan of how to do the challenge, we won't be able to
make it back in time, 'cause we have essentially no
margin for error when we get there. We have literally one minute
to make a transfer, and then we have to sprint
to the flag and back, and that's the only way. So, fingers crossed
it's a good one. Okay. Alright, Adam. Here I come. Ready?
Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle. Cursed!
Get on a late train. The next train you
get on must arrive at the station where you board
at least one minute late. 14... At 2:31. So if it's still here at 2:32... That might be an
all-time colossal L. Okay, so Adam and Ben
have gotten off at Hamamatsu. Which is the next stop. So I gotta get off there too. Yeah. I think we're pretty much toast. It was gonna be tough
regardless, but... There goes our train on time. Scotty's gonna be very
delighted when he gets here. I mean, should
we even bother hiding? I mean... We're not gonna make
it in time anymore. I mean, there's a 0% chance
we're gonna make it in time, 'cause we needed to be on
that train, which is gone. And we can't even get
on the next one or... Who knows when we
could get on a train? Just for fun, do you wanna
make Scotty walk sideways? Yeah. (whispering) Ohh... no. They have just informed me
they dropped a Mud Tower. I can barely walk normally. I will still catch you. Even if I have to do it sideways. Well, now we
simply await death. Who other people call,
Scotty from Strange Parts. I got my sideways legs on. Let's do this. What are you doing? What's going on? Hello, you're tagged. Scotty, I think that's
the end of round three. But— Oh yeah, you don't know! Yeah, he doesn't know
what happened. (laughs) Yeah he doesn't know.
Oh, Scotty! I just pulled up,
and you're both sitting here, in plain view out the window. Yeah we— Right where I
happened to be on the train. We went ahead and
(bleep)-ed ourselves pretty bad. I did, which
is why I got off. You wanna see why? Yes, I do wanna see why. It turns out that trains
don't really do that here. Well, Scotty, I think we'll
see you in the tiebreaker. (giggles) I'll see you there! Caption+ by JS*

back to episode five of Capture the Flag across Japan. We're a few hours into
round three, and with Scotty safely
back in Tokyo Station, both teams have scored
their near flags. Now, all eyes on me! I've captured Ben and Adam's
second flag up here in Niigata, and all I need to do is
get it back over the line without getting caught. That's gonna be tough, because Adam is right on
my tail heading towards me on the exact same line I need to
take to get back to Tokyo Station. But with minutes to spare, I think I've cooked up a plan
that can get me out. Okay, I think I've
got it figured out. And it's so complicated that I'm not
even sure I can explain it right. And I'm not even sure
if I have this right. It's very complicated. So basically there's
one of two options. Either Adam gets off
at Urasa Station to cut me off on the Shinkansen, knowing that I'm gonna— Oh man. Can I even explain this? I might— This might
need to be in VO. Hi there, it's Sam from
the future with VO, to explain my complicated
but kind of awesome plan. Right now, I'm on a
Shinkansen headed south. Adam is on the same
Shinkansen line, but headed north. Now, I have two routes back
over the midpoint. The first is that I
get off here in Nagaoka and take a regional line
to Jōetsu over the line. The problem is,
there's a 15 minute wait between when I can get
off the train at Nagaoka and when I can get on
the train to Jōetsu. And in that time, Adam will
arrive to Nagaoka to catch me. But here's the thing, and this is
the especially complicated part. Adam's train will leave its
last stop before Nagaoka – a station called Urasa –
at 11:44. But my train will leave from
Nagaoka one minute later. That means if Adam
stays on his train and heads to Nagaoka
to try to stop me, I have one minute to
realize what he's done, and can decide to
stay on my train and pass him right
on the Shinkansen, taking me across the line,
scot free. And if he gets off at Urasa
to try to prevent that, I can just do my first plan: get off at Nagaoka and take
the regional line to Jōetsu. Basically, as far as I can tell, I found a no-lose scenario,
no matter what Adam does. And as you're about to see, he's only figured out
half of my plan. Okay, so I'm almost certain
that I figured out Sam's plan. I think that he's gonna
try to get to Jōetsu. Right here. But in order to do that,
he's gonna have to go to Nagaoka first. And then he can leave
at 12:01. I'm gonna get to Nagaoka
at 11:54. My guess... is that he is going
to try to use a tower in order to avoid getting caught. So I think I should
buy a tower now so that I could potentially slow
him down enough to catch him. Tower deck. Shuffle. Lightning Tower. On the tens of each hour,
your opponent must roll a die. If the number is one,
they are tagged. Okay. Okay. So as I board my train, Adam has a
mostly useless tower and only knows half my plan. I'm home free. After all, this plan
took me a half hour looking at maps and
timetables to figure out. There's no way Adam can crack it
in the next five minutes, right? Okay, wait a minute.
I just realized he could jump me. He could jump me.
He could continue past me. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. To Urasa Station. Oh, oh, oh. He would get there... 11:58, after me. Okay, so Adam
figured out the plan. But even still, he doesn't
have any way to stop it. Right? I'm 70% sure that this plan is a
guaranteed path to victory. But it's really complicated. So I'm worried I might be
misunderstanding something. I really don't think that he has
a way to block me at this point. But I know I'm gonna look like
such an idiot if he does. If I... keep going past Urasa... he can keep going
and pass me. I need a tower.
I need a tower. I need a tower, shoot. Okay. Oh, my god, okay. Alright, here we go. Shuffle. Trap Tower. If opponents are texted
""trap!"" in this area, they are frozen for 30 minutes. Opponents do not need to be
informed of this tower's placement, but if someone says they
placed a Trap Tower, it must be the truth. Trap Tower. Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, okay. Alright, either
I'm about to look like the world's biggest idiot
or a genius. We'll see. Okay, so what's happening
is a little bit confusing, but let me try to
walk you through it. I am at Urasa Station. Sam is about to be
at Nagaoka Station. Now, from Nagaoka, he has
two ways across the midpoint. One is to connect on a
regional line and go to Jōetsu. Now, I can get to Nagaoka in time to catch him,
before he can do that. But if I continue to Nagaoka... he can stay on his train
and just jump me on the track down to Urasa
and then score that way. So the plan is this. I'm going to drop both
the Lightning Tower – which I'll have to tell him about – and the Trap Tower
secretly at Urasa. Then I'll continue up. He'll think that he can
just pass down through. But he can't.
He'll be frozen. Then he'll have three times that
he might get struck by lightning. And I'll be able to go after him. (sigh) This is gonna rock. Alright, Adam's
pulling into Urasa now. So now he's gotta decide,
does he stay on or get off? And I don't think
either's the right option. Alright, I'm at Urasa. I've just told them that I'm
placing down the Lightning Tower. But I am also placing
down the Trap Tower. But Sam won't know that
until I spring the trap. Adam has arrived
in Urasa Station. Kind of hope he continues on. That'll make a quicker run for me. But on the other hand,
the other run will be on a nice, small regional line,
which I haven't been able to do yet. Ooh, he dropped a thing. Interesting. What is it gonna be? Oh, that's not too bad. So let's see if he gets off. Okay, so the timing of this, I mean, this is a matter of... I mean, less than a minute. Sam is just now finding out
that I am headed to Nagaoka. Alright. That means, I assume
that he is saying, ""Oh my gosh, I can jump Adam.""
He thinks I'm an idiot. He's gonna jump me
and go down to Urasa. But when he does that,
I will trap him. Oh. Adam has continued on. That means I am
staying on this train. The thing is, that tower
only has a one-mile radius. There's actually no guarantee
that I'm even within it on the tens of an hour. And even then, it's
only a 1-in-10 chance. There he goes. There he goes, okay. That is what I thought. Alright, we're
about to pass each other. For the sake of him not
nabbing me through the windows, I'm gonna go hide. We're about
to cross each other. That's— Sam was on that train. And he believes... that he's just pulled
an incredible move. But in seven minutes,
he will be so sad. Okay, well, this is not good. I have to get out. Man, that sucks! That's the one
thing they could do. Oh. And now the next train here
is not for an hour. And Adam's gonna be on it. Man, that was a lucky pull. And they got it yesterday too! Ugh. (cackles happily) We got him, baby. (chortles mockingly) Mmmm! Ohhh. Oh, it feels so good! (stifled giggling) Let's absolutely go! Okay, I made it
back to Tokyo Station with the flag. Untagged. Very happy about that. There's one thing I have to do. Celebratory drinking of the flag. That's really good. Okay, I do not have enough coins even to get all the
way out to our flag. I need 3,280 coins. So I either need to do a
challenge or go on defense. Let me see where they're at. Sam looks like he's hurting. Adam's heading off Sam. Ben's back here with me,
in Tokyo Station. Okay, so what are
you gonna do, Ben? That's going to dictate
a lot of what I do. Alright, well, I made it
back to Tokyo Station three minutes after Scotty. Well played. Honestly, you deserve that flag.
That was crazy. Now that I've made it
back to Tokyo Station, the idea is that I'm gonna
go back on offense... and finish the challenge that
I started before I got tagged, which is the Mario items one. Okay, so what happened
next is kind of boring and also kind of complicated, so we're just gonna
fast-forward a bit. Basically, Scotty ran into Ben
at the train station and decided to follow him. I can just
follow you, right? That led Ben to take a train
back into his own territory to get away from Scotty,
so with nothing else to do, Scotty decided to do a challenge. He pulled
Meet Your Local Yuru-chara, which are these little city mascots
that are all over Japan, and headed to Akihabara
– Tokyo's anime capital – to look for one. Despite going to multiple stores, he was not successful. Do you have yuru-chara? No, I don't. Sorry.
No? Okay, thank you. Do you have yuru-chara? No? Okay. Arigatō gozaimasu. Sumimasen.
Hai? Do you have yuru-chara? Yuru-chara?
Yeah. Oh, yuru-chara. Any. Ah, no, no.
No? Yeah, sorry.
Okay, okay, thank you. Ooh, crap. Meanwhile, Ben headed back
towards offensive territory to earn coins to make a
run for the middle flag, but on his way, decided to stop
to see if he could catch Scotty. Okay, you know what? Scotty is right at the station
that I'm about to go through. So I think I'm just gonna pop out and try and get him on my way. Scotty got freaked out
and started running away, deciding to veto his challenge, figuring he could wait out his
jail period while he evaded Ben. If I'm gonna hike,
I may as well hike while I'm in a veto period. Alright, I'm declaring a veto. But Ben took one look at this, and figured he wouldn't be able
to find Scotty here anyways. Oh, I'm never
gonna find Scotty here. Okay, this is just a waste of time. So he got on a train and
headed into enemy territory to knock out his challenge. While Ben made his way
to Shimbashi Station to look for Mario Kart items, Scotty ran out his veto clock
and went on the hunt for Ben. Okay, it looks like
Ben got off at... Shimbashi Station. So I'm thinking he's probably
out doing a challenge right now. If you are, Ben, I can't wait to take
those coins from you. Oh, just in time. Okay, I made it to Shimbashi. All I have to do is
find a grocery store... get a mushroom,
a banana, and shells. Seemingly, there's a grocery store in or right outside of the station. So I'm trying to figure out
how to get there. Knock this out as
quickly as possible. Alright, okay. Banana. That's one down. Okay, at Tokyo Station. Alright, Ben,
where are you at? He seems still at the station. Sumimasen. Shimbashi? No, okay.
Arigatō gozaimasu. What the heck train
do I need to get on? Mushrooms. Something with a shell. Oh wait. If I pay for these in cash
and then get a coin back, then I'll have all three. Arigatō gozaimasu. But where's Ben? Still there. I think? Oh, nope. Where'd you go, Ben?
Oh, you're back here. Hi. Let's go find you. Where are you going? Alright, I just gotta transfer
to platform four. And then I've got two trains... headed to flag number two. I won't have enough to get back, so I'll have to do another
challenge along the way, but I just want to get going. Where are you? You are this way. Do I see Scotty? Yeah, Scotty's over there. Well... Let's not let him see
where we're going. Here we go. Oh, he's gone.
Where'd he go? He headed back north. That's annoying. Well, I'm stuck here. And it's noon. So... Might as well see
if I'm tagged. Well, I'm not tagged at least. But, I'm gonna be stuck
here for quite a while more. Damn. That's kind of incredible. Both yesterday and today,
they pulled the best tower. (sigh) Okay, there we go. I bought myself
ten more minutes. Alright, I'm trying to
figure out next steps. To be honest, I don't know if I
have many options at this point. But there are very
few trains from here, and Adam can get on
most of them. We'll see. Okay, so here's the best plan
I was able to come up with. There's a southbound Shinkansen
headed through here soon. Adam is probably going
to get on it at 12:47, because if he doesn't, I could get on it and head
south over the midpoint. But at the same minute Adam
would get on that train, there's a slow regional line
heading north to Nagaoka, the station where Adam is now. When Adam gets on
the Shinkansen, I'll be on that and ride
it up towards Nagaoka. He'll be able to beat me
there by taking a Shinkansen, but when he does, I can probably just turn back
around on the regional line. Essentially by going
on this regional line, I can force him to ping-pong
back and forth in the Shinkansen, at worst wasting his time, and at best getting him to
slip up and let me through. Alright, safe another ten minutes. Of all the places
to get frozen at, I like this one.
It's a really cool town. See, there's a little
ski hill over there. You can see some snow left over
in the distance over there. Very cool. Time for another roll. Alright, we are safe once again. Nice! Alright, I'm freed
from the freeze, and I have about 15 minutes until the train I want
to take outta here. So I'm gonna just go check out
the outside for a second. When you ever get to be in the
middle of the mountains in Japan? This is cool. Those mountains. Cool. Look at just how
elevated these rails are, and how big of a setup that is. Kind of incredible
that they have that for hundreds of miles
across the country, but that's how they make
the trains go vroom. This house has a
lovely little garden right next to the
massive train station. I wish I had more time to explore, 'cause this place is awesome, but... gotta get on that train. Try to see if I can
fake Adam out and waste a little
bit more of his time. Time for another roll. Oh, safe still, wow. We're getting lucky with these. Oh? Well, that makes sense. So he's taken a regional line north. Not shocking, I guess. But... He's trapped over here. Oh (bleep) Oh no. Oh, god dammit. Okay. Damn it, okay. Here's what just happened. Okay, so I just messed up. Basically, the tracker
was being a little weird, and it looked like Adam didn't get
on the Shinkansen headed south. Meaning I thought
I had the chance to get off the regional train
at the first stop and run the two miles back
to the Shinkansen station just in time to catch it
and return the flag. The problem is, as you just saw, it turns out Adam did
get on the Shinkansen, meaning I'm now
stuck at this station whose only trains go back to Urasa,
where Adam is about to arrive, or will go stop at Urasa, again, where Adam is about to be,
before getting to me. Basically, I'm now just about
completely trapped. So anyway, that was a
long shot anyway. But I guess that
means that I'm in full ""Let's waste Adam's time"" mode. (whispering)
Look at that. Look at that. Okay, so it seems as though
he's just kind of hanging out... at a place called... Yairo Station. I mean, I could walk there. If he really is there. He could get on a train
headed back here... in 11 minutes. Okay, okay. Then this one goes up 1:52. Okay, fine. Okay, fine, yeah. Hang out at Yairo. No worries. Hang out at Yairo. I'll hang out here, and then... You won't take a train over here. That'd be stupid of you,
the 1:15. But I'll wait here
and see if you do. But if you don't... There are no more trains at
that station for a half an hour. I'll just run there. Fine, cool with me. Cool with me, dude. Let's see. What's the plan, Sam?
You wanna go straight for me? You totally can. But it's probably
not your best move. But what is your best move,
my man? What is your best move, man? Because if you stay there,
I'm coming for you! You're screwed. You're screwed is what I'm saying. What's up?
Hey, Scotty. I just did a small
gamble that the— and the tracker led me wrong. Which is fine, it was a
real long shot anyways. Good news is, it is
very picturesque here. There's snowcapped
mountains in the background. Oh my god. Bad news is—
That sounds amazing. Yeah, bad news is I kinda
just want to go for a hike and waste Adam's time. But it is raining.
Yeah. Sounds like y'all've gone
on an adventure. Don't get caught.
Yeah. That's your only plan.
Just don't get caught. Yeah, pretty much. I think we're both just trying
to waste time, pretty much. Yep. Sounds good.
Alright. Bye.
Have fun. Alright, this is now
Project Waste Adam's Time. Looks like staying to me. Alright. It's a three-kilometer run. Let's go for it. Man, this would be much
better if I had a raincoat. If I had a raincoat,
or it wasn't raining, I would just walk into eternity. But I don't wanna give
myself hypothermia, 'cause it is kind of cold out. That would not be a
viable winning strategy. (laughs) I wanna get there
with a little bit of margin. 'Cause I'm assuming he's
got a tower waiting for me. Oh, you know what? I think I have the budget. Might as well pull a tower
and mess with Adam. Yeah, I have 870.
Let's pull a tower and drop it. That way he won't get
in my budget at least. Okay. Jail Tower. Jail Tower. Opponents may only leave
this area after rolling doubles. They may only roll a die
every five minutes. Whew. Okay, well that was
about what I expected. I have to roll doubles. (bleep) Look at these gardens.
These are delightful. This is genuinely delightful. Wait a minute! I misread the card! The card does not say
I can't move in the area. It just says I can't leave the area. I can move in the area all I want! Oh, Sam, you're (bleep)-ed! Alright, Adam's at the
other side of the station. Alright, this game is about to just
purely turn into hide-and-seek. The train station's up there. Yeah, it's gotta be this. Where is he? I just spotted him. He was on that bridge. Where is he? Not in there. Where is he? Shows him right up there. Shows him right up there. Where... would that be? This little bridge
has come in clutch. What the hell? He must be hiding. He can't get out.
He can't get on a train. Oh wait, was that him? Is that a car? No, I think that was a car. I mean... The tracker makes it look like
he's just behind this thing. Alright, he's gonna come
running right there in a little bit. There he is! Oh, he was under the tracks! Ohh. Alright. That... is Sam Denby. Did you enjoy your run? Yeah, it was... really annoying. I don't know why you did that. Why, what do you mean? Why did you run? Because if I hadn't run... you could have gotten
on a train going north. There was— but
there was only one train. The one that you could have taken. I am now realizing that. (chuckles) I guess that one did go north. Yeah. So it would've
gone through my station. Yeah. Well... This was fun though. Yeah? (coughing chuckles) Yeah, that train would've left
from that station, wouldn't it have? Alright, gimme the flag. Oh. Thank you. Alright, what
are you doing, Ben? What are you doing? Okay, so, I need to figure out... how to intercept Ben. I think Shinjuku is the place to go. Yep. Yep, bingo. Okay, Shinjuku. Alright.
I made it to Shinjuku. It seems like they're
not after me yet, which is great. Now, I've got about
15 minutes until my next train. So I think what I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna pull my
next challenge. And I won't be able
to do it on the train, but I'll be able to strategize, figure out a way to do it
as quickly as possible when I get to the second flag. Okay, we're doing another awkward card shuffle. And we're gonna pull the top one. Clean up three
pieces of litter. Each piece of litter
must be equal to at least the width or
volume of a quarter. Each piece of litter
you collect must be at least ten feet apart from any other
piece of litter you collect. Clean up three
pieces of litter. (laughs) That might be hard. Because this country
is so dang clean. But, mostly it should
be not too bad to do... when I get to the second flag. So that should be pretty quick. I'm not too worried about that.
I'm pretty happy. (softly) Alright,
I made it on the train. We're headed for flag number two. Good bye,
greater Tokyo area, finally. Okay, he is heading out. I gotta get on the next train. Scotty is coming after me. And he's gonna arrive before I'll be able to get
the flag back onto a train. So I don't really have
an escape route yet. But what I can do is... I can keep doing challenges
while I evade Scotty, and then buy towers until... I've made the area so
inhospitable that... I'll have a way to get
on a train and get out. Not the greatest plan... but kind of my only option
at this point. I thought I was gonna
have more margin, but... Yeah, he caught up. (sigh) It is absolutely
gorgeous here. Spectacular. See, this is the train that
you could have taken, Adam. Yeah, I could've taken that.
Yeah. Yeah, I didn't
think about that one. You wouldn't have
been able to experience— I mean, this countryside, of all the places that
you could have froze me, I'm very grateful
you froze me here. Yeah, you're welcome. How did you feel about
my little trap there? Were you feeling really good when
you passed me on the Shinkansen? I was feeling pretty good. I was so excited when
I realized what I could do. It was such a
guaranteed path to victory with such a tiny, tiny way
to close it down. Oh yeah.
That's so annoying. Okay, so I am
actually realizing I can't leave this area
until I roll doubles. It's definitely been five minutes. When is the train that we
need to get on from here? 2:30, so if you don't get it, that is unbelievably bad luck. That'd be bad. Oh?
Oh? Alright, another five minutes. I mean, I have another... I guess seven tries. Yes. But I mean... It's possible. (laughs)
It's possible. That would suck. Alright, you get another roll. Alright, trying again. Heyyy! Congrats. Alright, I can
now leave the area. I only had six more tries. (humming) (backpack zipping) Choo-choo. Oh, we gotta press the button. This is such a
nice train for a rural... Imagine if—
Yeah. Just imagine if trains. I know.
Yeah. (stammers) Truly, imagine if trains. Yeah, that'd be nice. (humming) Okay, here's the plan.
I'm getting off at this stop. We're gonna try and do our
challenge as quickly as possible. We're gonna buy a tower,
and we're gonna go from there. I don't know if this is gonna work. This feels kind of
like a crazy plan, but I've got nothing better, so... Let's just see if this works. Oh. Japan, I need you to
not be so clean right now. Oh my god, it's immaculate. I'm not seeing a
single piece of trash. None. Oh. Trash number one. Looks like
he's doing a challenge? That's my best guess. I thought he would
jump back on the train, but maybe he doesn't have
enough coins, I dunno. Oh, trash number two. If I can... Trash number two. Piece of trash
number three, okay. Let's buy a tower. Let's buy a tower. Oh, they're sticky. I spilled a lot of coffee
in my bag yesterday, and so my towers are
kind of sticky, but... Gonna pull the top one. Mud Tower. Mud Tower. All opponents must walk sideways. Okay, this one's not terrible. I'm just gonna throw
it down right now, 'cause I might as well. 'Cause it's got a big radius, and it's gonna slow
Scotty down a lot. Great, okay. I'm gonna let him know. Oh, Mud Tower. All opponents must walk sideways. Oh my god, okay. That's gonna kill me. My plan is to drop a tower as well, but from the train
as I go by him. So I'm gonna draw a tower right now. I'm gonna go for this one. Pizza Tower, yes! Pizza Tower. Opponents may only move in
this area while holding pizza. That's amazing. That is hands-down the
best draw I could've made. Okay. That's so good. Okay, so Scotty's
gonna be here before the next train that
gets me closer to the flag. Flag's two miles away,
so I'm gonna have to walk. Because if I wait around
here to take that train, he's just gonna get me. So... Since Scotty can only walk
sideways, if I walk to the flag, he's gonna have a
hard time keeping up. But we're gonna pull
our next challenge, and... hope it's a good one. Spend exactly 940 yen. You must pay in cash. If you go over this amount,
you must start over. You may not use a tip or
offer to pay more or less than an item's usual value. You may not buy anything
by weight or volume. Spend exactly 940 yen. Oh, we're slipping. This doesn't get us a ton,
but it should be pretty easy. And also, I desperately need food, so we can do this on the way. But we just gotta start making
our way towards the flag. So, we're going on
a little adventure. Okay, I'm placing it
there at the intersection. I think that covers
the most rail stations. I'm gonna drop it when
I actually go by, but... That will really screw him up. But also, I gotta walk
sideways to go catch him. Hopefully he doesn't
already have pizza. With Scotty hot on his tail, Ben managed to spend exactly
940 yen at this vending machine, spent those coins on another tower, and began to make his way
towards the flag. But well before he could get there, Scotty arrived in Kōfu and
threw down the Pizza Tower. That meant Ben had to
stop whatever he was doing and go directly to the nearest
place where he could buy pizza, which unfortunately for him, was right back near Kōfu Station. So now, it's a race. Can Ben buy a slice of pizza
at this pizza place and safely reroute
back to the flag? Or is Scotty gonna manage
to tag him while only being able
to walk sideways? This is really silly. I think I do want to go after him,
'cause he has to find pizza. But once he finds pizza,
he can do whatever he wants. I wonder if I throw
down another tower. I have the money. Let's do that. Okay. I got Jail Tower. Jail Tower. Opponents may only leave
this area after rolling doubles. They may only roll a die
every five minutes. Okay, cool. That's great. That will work. And we're just gonna
drop that right now. Okay, now I just chase him
very, very slowly. Here I come, Ben. Looks like Adam is nervously
sending strategy to Ben right now. I'm putting in a
takeout order for pizza at a— Really? Maybe. It seems like regardless,
Scotty is closing in on Ben. Yeah, but he can
only walk sideways. Yeah, but Ben
has to go get pizza. We'll see. Oh, sumimasen.
Sumimasen. Okay. That is the pizza place. Okay, where's Scotty? Almost there, Adam. (breathing heavily) I'm only a couple blocks
behind him. C'mon, turn green. Okay. I saw him. Just don't think
I was close enough. They're on the same block. Uh oh. Okay. Ah (bleep) I just went to a pizza place,
and it was closed. So, now I'm going to
another pizza place. (bleep), now I'm
moving towards Scotty. Currently Ben seems to be
moving in the direction of Scotty. It's a bold strategy. It's a bold strategy. (breathing heavily) Parkour! We can't be
talking more than... several feet at this point, right? There he is. That's it. Ooh... tough. Pizza Tower. It's a powerful tower. Oh, that sucks. Caption+ by JS*

at the end of the season, and we tried to think of some
way to set up this ad read, but we cannot think of any
possible way to set it up without spoiling everything. So all we're gonna say is... the next episode is available
right now on Nebula. And that is all
we can say about it. And also on Nebula,
you can listen to this week's episode of
The Layover, which is our weekly recap podcast. We get on a call with Scotty. We talk about what
happened this week. And this week is a fun one, because I retroactively figured out that it actually was really
smart for me to run after Sam. And that something bad could have
happened if I didn't do that. And I will explain why it was
actually really smart of me on the podcast. I'm gonna force the audio editor
to cut that out or something. It will stay in! I'm gonna be the autocrat. Manni, it stays in! And in addition
to these boys arguing, Nebula has a lot more to offer, like lots of great original series
from your favorite creators. I mean, we've put up whole
documentaries on there. Yeah. The first project we
ever worked on together, Alaska's Silent Summer... Very different.
Very different. Very depressing. But it's on Nebula. But depressing in a good way. Depressing in an interesting way.
I'm very proud of it. Yeah. Brian from Real Engineering,
our season one and four guest, has a series called
Battle for Britain that's great. Joseph from RealLifeLore
was our season two guest. He has this series
called Modern Conflicts, that people are
totally obsessed with. There's so much good stuff on there. And it's more jam-packed
with quality content than any other streaming
service I personally pay for. So, I say it's totally worth
the price of a subscription. Yeah, really
good value for money. And a lot of, in my
opinion, why it's good is because it was founded
and continues to be run and owned by creators. So, you know, a lot of the
idea was we thought that creators themselves,
the people making the content, would've a better understanding
of how to make a platform that both, you know, incentivized
the things you want to incentivize for creators to make good content. And also, you know,
creating an ecosystem that is a better viewing
experience for the audience. Us creators came together
and we were like, ""How do we make it better?"" And the answer was
basically two things. We're gonna create a better
experience for the audience through everything we've
kind of just mentioned. By the way, all of this is
ad and sponsorship free. There are no ads or
sponsorships on Nebula. So it's just the
viewing experience itself, super simple and super good. But it's also, you know,
a better deal for the creators. And a lot of that is
about the fact that when you sign up using our link,
nebula.tv/jetlag, we get a portion of
your subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed. Which means we have stable,
recurring monthly revenue that we can rely on to
reinvest in the show and make it bigger and
better and cooler and more frequently
and everything. If you use our link,
you'll actually get $20 off an annual subscription, which makes it come out to
two and a half dollars a month, I think, which is really not a lot to
pay for Jet Lag early by itself, but then it comes with the entire
rest of the streaming site. So, very good deal for you.
Very good deal for the creators. So, sign up at
nebula.tv/jetlag and thank you in advance
for your support. Bye!"

Chibis by Twitchy Sparrow","psV10AE_znY","Hello and welcome
back to episode four of Capture the Flag across Japan. We're about to start the third
and final round of the game, where the board has been expanded
to cover the whole country, and each team has
three flags to capture. The round is over when
one team has scored all of their opponent's flags,
or at the end of 20 hours, where the team that has
scored the most flags wins. If at the end of 20 hours, both teams have scored
these same number of flags, then the round goes to whichever
team has transported unscored flags the most total distance
towards the center. This round's three points
are worth a lot. Right now, the score is 3-0. That means that if Ben and Adam win,
they'll win the whole thing. But if Scotty and I win,
the game is tied, and we'll go to our
sudden death tiebreaker round. It's still anybody's game... and it all comes down to this. Alright, Jet Laggers.
Ready for round three? Let's do it. Alright, we'll start it in
three, two, one... Let's go. Alright, let's go, Adam. We don't have
a lot of coins, so— I'm gonna go grind
challenges to start. And we're gonna send
Adam for the near flag. Yeah, 'cause I do
have enough to get to that. So, I'm gonna look up
how to get there... and then just make a beeline. They're not
even looking at us. Okay, so—
Let's go now. So, Scotty... The last couple rounds
didn't exactly go our way. Yeah, I was pretty demoralized at the end of last round,
I have to say. And the thing is
there's not one moment from yesterday at least that's
like, this is where we lost it. No! It was just like our
fundamental strategy was wrong. Yes. I think we want to kind of be
more responsive to what they do. I think so. Especially considering
this is gonna be a long round. I think so. You know, it's not
gonna be a speedrun. So I think we want
to kind of just wait, see what they're doing.
I mean, they were booking it. So I wonder if they're
running to catch a train. Alright, here we go. Alright, let's see... how to get to the flag. Okay, come on, come on,
come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Okay. Okay, the Chūō Line. The Chūō Line. Where the (bleep) is that? We're just gonna go one stop
into enemy territory... and... start pulling challenges. So we want to go to
platform six, right up here. Platform one, platform one. That's for Ōme— Oh. Oh. Oh, incredible, okay. The doors on the
right side will open... Sam and Scotty,
still at Tokyo Station. Tick-tock, boys! Better get a move on! Hey, Sam.
Hey, so they split up. Adam seems to be on the
train to the second flag. Ben went south.
He's headed towards Shinagawa. I don't know exactly
which train he's on yet. What do you think? Should I maybe get ready for
a run of the second flag then? 'Cause they seem to be both
going somewhat offensive. Yeah, sounds good. Okay, so I'll get on
the platform ready for a run, and then I'll see you in a bit. Or well, we'll talk in a bit.
Okay. Okay, bye.
Yeah. Alright, so I have a train in about 20 minutes that I
could take to our second flag. So I'm just gonna sit around here and try to learn a little bit more
about what Ben and Adam are doing, based on train times and stuff. Okay. Hello. We're gonna shuffle, shuffle,
shuffle, shuffle, shuffle. And then we're gonna pull one. Find a Maneki-neko. Find any Maneki-neko,
and take a photograph of it. Any statue or figurine of a
cat with a raised paw counts. That I can hopefully do. These maneki-nekos,
these are a thing I guess that are popular in Japan. They're these cat statues
that go like this. And then sometimes their
paw goes like that. I don't really know where
I would go to find one, but maybe a... restaurant or something? Alright, so Ben is
down at Shimbashi Station. I'm not really— He must be doing
challenges, I guess. So maybe Scotty
should go after him. Lemme call Scotty. So Ben is down at
Shimbashi Station, I assume doing challenges. That's exactly where
I caught him yesterday. I wonder if it makes sense
for you to go after him. See if you can tag— That's exactly what
I was trying to figure out. Okay, see if you can tag him.
And if you did tag him, maybe then you would
have a really good window to get the Tokyo flag. Or at least go towards it with him in jail at Tokyo Station. That seems like a good opportunity. Okay, I'll do that. Going to Shimbashi Station. Take the JR line here... and it's go, go, go. I'll be there in ten minutes. Just gonna keep my eyes peeled. 'Cause these things
could be anywhere. Oh my god. This is— Okay, I found one. Okay, okay. Challenge complete. Collect three
items from Mario Kart. Your options are:
banana peel, mushroom, big yellow star, shell, bullet,
bomb, boomerang, coin, squid, feather, venus fly trap.
No duplicates. Collect three
Mario Kart items. Let's check where Ben is. Oh, great. Ben is way far away
from the station. Feel really good about this. Ben, here I come! Let's make sure that I'm safe. Oh (bleep) Okay, well, actually it looks
like Scotty's coming after me. Alright, it's about ten minutes
until that Shinkansen, so I'm gonna get to the platform. Scotty's getting close.
I like this. Now he's getting
ready to run probably. Scotty will never find— Oh, he is getting closer. So... here's the thing. The station I need to get
outta here with is right there. But Scotty's coming for me, so I think I just gotta give
him the slip some other way. I gotta look for other stations. We're gonna go here. We're gonna tire Scotty out. Because I'm young. And full of... youthful vigor. Oh, I'm so tired already. Alright, I'm gonna
take a right at the next alley. But I'm getting progressively
closer, which is good. There's a subway up ahead.
If I just hop on it and go any direction,
but especially... Maybe I should just reset
to my safe territory... and then I can really
get some distance on him. Oh, good,
there's a pass through. I've got options. This is the station
we have to go to. Scotty's already probably figured
out that I'm going this way, but that's okay. Oh crap, he's
headed for a station. Okay, lemme pick up the pace. (panting) Ben should be close. Okay, I think that this is
going back into my territory. But Scotty could
be here any second. I hope he hasn't
already gotten on a train. Alright. This is a train. As long as Scotty doesn't
get here, I'm good. That's a train coming. Crap. Oh my god, oh my god. Sumimasen, sumimasen. That's Ben! Ben. Hi.
(sighs) Alright, let's get off. (laughs exhaustedly) Alright. Back to Tokyo Station. (whispering)
Let's go, Scotty. Let's go. Incredible. That's so good. So good. See you in a bit! Tokyo flag, here I come. And not ride with him. Alright, time to transfer to the Tamagawa Line
for Koremasa. Tamagawa Line, there we go. Tamagawa Line. No problem. It's weird I have to
leave the station. Tamagawa Line, Tamagawa Line. Where the hell's the
Tamagawa Line? Oh no. Ben got tagged. Shoot. Okay. And I can't find the
damn Tamagawa Line. Tamagawa. Tamagawa. Seibu Tamagawa. What the hell? Where's the... Is it this? This is orange. Is this what I want? Koremasa.
Yeah, yeah, Koremasa. Yeah, yeah, that's me. Yep, 8:42, that's me. Alright. Oh, Ben. Alright, it is 9:16, which means that
I am back in the game. It looks like Scotty's
going for the near flag, but it's gonna be a really
tough one to defend, because there are a million
routes back to Tokyo. Now, most of them go through
this station called Kitasenju. Not all of them, but most of them. So if I go there, I've got my— the best chance
of intercepting him. And hopefully if he takes one
that's not going through there, I'll have time to
switch and cut him off. So I'm gonna go there
and stake him out there, and hopefully I can get him
before he gets back. A very nice lady on a
bicycle just said hello to me. It's not something we've
seen a lot of yet, but... It's always fun. People are always...
welcoming and... and eager to test
out their English, even if it is only ""Hello."" So... Sam says that Ben is after me. Which makes sense, I guess. I'm almost at the flag. Oh, I see it. It's on the
other side of the road. Okay. So, Coca-Cola. Okay, right, hang on.
I gotta figure out change. Yep, we're good. Okay, Dr Pepper acquired. Headed back to the station. I wanna win that boat. Alright, let's go. Just seven minute run to the flag. Should be easy. Let's go to the flag. Which by the way... seems, as far as I can tell, to serve a chicken intestine stew. So that's cool. It's very charming over here. That's fun. Okay, one thing that drives
me insane about this country is that you can't jaywalk. Nobody jaywalks. Even though I'm all good,
I live in New York City. Every bone in my body is
screaming at me to go. There we go, okay. Here we go. Should be coming up on it. Here we go. Oh yeah. Oh, you can... (sniff) Oh, you can smell... You can smell that that
is chicken intestine stew. For sure. Fourth one. Oh god, that is for sure... That is chicken
intestine stew, for sure. So now, here's the plan. I'm down to like 410 coins, so I'm gonna go ahead and
at least pull a challenge, see if it's something
that's easy to do, on my way over the line. Because if I could just
earn a few more coins, I could have enough money to
buy a tower for when I defend, and I do think that
that would be useful. Okay. I'm out of the neutral zone now. So I'm gonna pull a challenge. Alright, quick shuffle and... See a great wave. View any wave and remark
upon how great it is. It may be a real wave
or a depiction, though the depiction may not
come from anything traveling with you or a digital device. If you see the wave
while in Kanagawa, the reward is doubled. Okay. Okay, while I run... I'm just gonna look for
anything that might have a depiction of a wave. No waves. No waves yet. Okay, here's a vending machine. Maybe it has a wave in it? Or on it? Oh. That's a wave. It's a great wave. Alright, I've sent a
picture to the group. Sam and Scotty have both agreed that that is a depiction of a wave. Let's pull another challenge. Alright. Cursed!
You are now Hello Kitty. You cannot advance in the game until you find or create
a pink bow and put it on. Once you find the bow, you must wear it for
the next two hours. You cannot talk to or text
anyone other than the camera for that period of time. Cursed. (gasp) (bleep) Alright, I gotta go figure
out a way to make a pink bow. Alright, I can still talk to you. But to no one else. I can't text Ben. (snorts) Alright, so it looks like
Scotty made it back to the station. So the question's gonna be,
is he gonna go towards me, or is he gonna try and go around? We're just gonna wait
and see what he does. Well, crap. Sam says, ""Don't go that way."" Which way should I go
then, question mark? I think he said go on that
train that's arriving now, crap! See if I can get it. Okay. Talk about last
minute change, geez. Alright, it looks
like he's going around, so I have to go around and... try and cut him off the other way. I think I have time,
but I gotta hurry. I think this line goes
all the way to Tokyo Station. Okay, that's good. Probably just stay on this. Okay, so I just got
off here in Hatchōbori. I am gonna be able to
get on Scotty's train. It's gonna arrive right on this
platform in a couple of minutes. It's gonna be a little hairy,
but that's good content. So I'm gonna try. Sam says to get
off in Nishi-Funabashi. Okay. Yeah, there's some
good options. I like the subway option. That's pretty good,
the Tōzai Line. Okay, it looks like
Scotty transferred trains, so I have to hop up one station. Yeah, I think I can block
him off right there. I'm concerned that I
don't really know where Ben is. His radius is super
large on the tracker. I think I wanna go one more stop. Okay, now that I'm
confident what station— or what train he's on, I'm gonna move up towards
him on the Tōzai Line, at least one or two more stations, just to give me more time
to catch him on the train. Cannot tell where he is. Huge radius, no idea. Other than he's closer to me. Crap. Yeah, get off the next stop. That's the best I can do. Here we go. Let's take Ben on a hike. I am determined to
not let Ben catch me. Even if I have to
go to great lengths. I want to go to... this station. Via walking. I think Scotty's
going for Shiomi Station. I have to get on. See if there's any
way to cut him off. I think this line, the Ōedo... something line will take me down, and then I can go across and
hopefully beat him to the punch. Just gotta make
this train and I'm good. I see it. Scotty, you mother-(bleep) Okay. Oh, I'm gonna make it. This is good. Really good. I think I made it home free. Scotty made it
to Shiomi Station and got on a train, which
means I can't catch him. Well played Scotty,
you son of a gun. Tokyo. Tokyo. Okay. I made it back to
Tokyo Station with the flag. Untagged. With one flag scored, we're
starting this round in the lead. And better yet, Ben is stranded, Adam is stuck out here until
he can make himself a pink bow, and I'm almost at our second flag. Scotty got back to Tokyo Station. We just got the first flag.
This is looking up. Okay. Did a super quick transfer
from this local train to go one or two stops
to the flag. So grab a flag and then I need to
figure out how I'm getting back. Ooh. Ooh, that looks like
a store of some kind. This seems like a promising
place to make a pink bow. Irasshaimase. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Hair clip... here. Arigatō gozaimasu. I did a little sign language
""Thank you,"" okay. Okay. I'm now Hello Kitty. Alright, let's go return this flag. Okay. (sputters) Alright, out in the open
for the first time today. This is great. So just got off of
this little stop here. And I'm going a few blocks in to look for the cheesecake
vending machine. And I have about 15 minutes until the next train back to
the big station from there. So I gotta be quick because
those trains only come every once in a while. I can pretty confidently
say at this point that we out here, you know? This is not Tokyo anymore. I'm pretty sure I see it already. That was easy. Just like that, here's our flag. This is our flag. Now let's bring it back to Tokyo. Alright, only a few minutes
to make my transfer. Keihin–Tōhoku Line. Yeah, nice.
Just a few minutes on this... Up to Ōmiya,
get on the Shinkansen. Definitely gonna be
able to cut Sam off. It is incredibly quiet here, and I am incredibly conspicuous. I don't get the
sense that they have a lot of American vloggers
come through here. But it's really cool just to be
in a spot like this, that is... clearly super not touristy. I mean, who gets to come
to places like this? Especially for work? Alright, I've got
ten minutes until my train. That's actually kind of plenty. So heading back to the station now. Heading back to the
big Shinkansen station. Then I gotta figure out
how I gotta get back. I've made it
to Ōmiya Station. I got 13 minutes to
get on my Shinkansen. Okay. Okay. Let me just make sure. Platform 18, yep. Just in case I haven't
explained what I'm doing, let me basically
walk you through it. So, Sam is up here. That's a problem because this line goes over the midpoint up here at Takasaki. So I can't let him get there. So I'm riding the Shinkansen up. Hopefully I can get all
the way up to Nagaoka before he gets to where I am. Hopefully that'll
block him and make it so that he has to take
regional lines back, which at the very least
will slow him down a lot. And potentially, I can
kind of shift gears and go around and stop him on a
neutral line too, if I need to. So... That is the plan.
That is the plan. I think it should work. Time to go defend the flag. Alright, Adam is
officially headed my way. So, I need to figure
out a safe route back. These choke points
really are killer. I was not expecting them to be
quite this hard to get around. But yeah, it's like... If there was just a little bit more
time to get past that choke point, I would have an option, but... Problem is these Shinkansen
lines are so fast that the regional
lines around them, they're almost not worth anything, because you can just
take the Shinkansen up and down and
up and down to cut off at the choke points
on the regional lines. This is tough.
I don't know. I don't really know how
we're gonna get around this, beyond just kind of
brute force trying. Okay, I think I've
got it figured out. And it's so complicated
that I'm not even sure I can explain it right. And I'm not even sure
if I have this right. It's very complicated. I think I have it figured out. This is the one possible route out of bajillion different ones. But if I've done it right... this will guarantee
me safe passage. But I'm honestly not sure. Ohh, ohh. He would get there... 11:58, after me. Wait a minute,
so what does that mean? Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus So what you'll
see next episode is whether or not I can
slip past this guy and make it back to Tokyo. And it definitely gets exciting,
in my opinion. I would argue that it is the
most exciting thing that happens. It's good content.
The way in which that all plays out. It was, yeah, it was
honestly one of my favorite days of playing Jet Lag. Yeah.
Like ever, actually. It was a really cool day. So, I'm excited for
everyone to see it. You'll be able to see it
next week up here on YouTube. Or if you're a Nebula
subscriber, it's up now. Or if you're not an
Nebula subscriber... you probably should be one. Why should they be
a Nebula subscriber? It's Ben's turn
to say that this time. Oh, why should they
be a Nebula subscriber? Well, in addition to getting
to watch the show a week early, you also get access to our aftershow podcast
called The Layover, where every week,
we get together with Scotty, and we break down
that week's episode. We go over, you know,
all of the strategy and the what ifs and all of
the implications going forward. I think that this week's episode
is gonna be really interesting, because we were super scared
going into round three. It was daunting.
None of us knew what we were doing. I mean, all of
the strategy this game, we really didn't know
what we were doing. So talking about how,
you know, we made our plans
going into round three, and how they started to play out.
Yeah. We're getting to all of that, all of the nitty gritty in this week's
episode of The Layover. Tens of thousands of
people listen every week, so it's clearly not terrible. It might be terrible,
and people listen to it anyway. Yeah. Terrible, but good.
We don't know. Yeah, yeah, it could be.
In a fun way. Anyway, Nebula
also has so much other incredible original content. In addition to people posting
their videos one week early, we have full-length documentaries. We have full-length
actual, literal movies. There are multiple original
series from people like Real Engineering and Real Science
and RealLifeLore. All of the Reals are in there in addition to other people. We got the Real market on lock. The Real market is
locked down on Nebula. It was built to be the
best home for our content, and I genuinely do
believe that it is. Yeah, and a lot of
why that is, in my opinion, is because it's
creator-founded and creator-run, and turns out that we
might know how to make a better viewing experience
for our audiences a little bit better than
private equity firms maybe? Maybe, I don't know. So, it was actually
founded by myself and a bunch of my creator friends,
four years ago. And, a lot of our
approach going into it is we wanted to make it a better
experience for the audience, through all the kind of
things we were just mentioned. By the way, I don't know
if we even said, everything's ad and
sponsorship free. Oh yeah, did you say that? Yeah, no ads, no sponsorships. Not even an algorithm getting in
the way of your viewing experience. It's really content-first, but it's also all a better
experience for the creators too. More sustainable and
really just a business ecosystem that better supports them. One of the biggest aspects of that is that when you sign up using
our code, nebula.tv/jetlag, we actually get a portion
of your subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed. Which gives us recurring,
stable monthly revenue that we can really rely on
to reinvest in the show and make it bigger and
better and cooler and greater and more frequently and
everything, which is awesome. What's also awesome
is that if you sign up using our code,
nebula.tv/jetlag, you'll actually get $20 off
an annual subscription, which brings it down to
$30 a year or something. So that's two and a
half dollars a month. It's really not that expensive. It's like half of a latte per month. And it really helps
support us, again. So, yeah, make sure to sign up. Click the button on screen,

for your support. Bye!"

Chibis by Twitchy Sparrow","7S54BYznHi8","Hello and welcome
back to episode three of Capture the Flag across Japan. Right now, we're in the
middle of round two. In order to win the round, a team has to capture both
of their opponent's flags and get them over the line. Ben and Adam have already
captured the near flag, meaning that if Adam makes
it back with the far flag, the round is theirs, but
that's gonna take him hours. Scotty and I made a beeline
to capture the far flag, and we're already on our way back. The only problem is,
Ben is waiting for us at a devastating
choke point before Tokyo. Okay, now I have it figured out. Okay, so Ben's probably
going to there. Ōmiya. Oyama.
No, Ōmiya. Oh. We are stopping at Ōmiya. Oyama.
No, Ōmiya. What? Lemme see. So I think we can
be pretty confident that Oh, I see. That's where he is
trying to choke us off. Oh, he— No chance. They might think they
can give me the slip, but... If I pop down the Pizza Tower
and force them off their train... It's a pretty big station, but
I think I'd be able to get them. So... Yeah, I'm just gonna post up here. And sit menacingly
and hopefully... scare them or something.
I don't know. Are they scared?
I hope they're scared. Okay, so how
many coins do you have? Before we record. 1490.
Okay, and I have 2150. We're just in great shape. Just makes me feel
like we made the exact right decision yesterday. Yes.
Okay, so here's the plan. So I am
gonna carry the flag. And I'm gonna head
on a northern route that does not go on the Shinkansen. It's slow, but Ben is
not at all positioned to cut me off very well right now. Yeah.
If he does get close to me, my plan is to just get off the
train and take him on a hike. I'm gonna be
the bait basically. So Ben basically has to
make a judgment call. Does he go for me or
does he go for Scotty? We hope that he goes for me, but it's not a big deal if not,
because if he does, I'm in the clear to just
grab the other flag, quickly, take it over the line, and
then I'm free basically to either go on defense
or to, I don't know, maybe go meet you or something.
Right, yep. So I'm feeling pretty
good about our options. I'm feeling really good. I'm gonna put this inside the bag,
'cause otherwise I'm gonna lose it. I have to transfer
across town here, which is a 24 minute walk. And the train leaves 17 minutes
after you're supposed to be in. It leaves at 52. I think I'm gonna book it. Oh, you gotta run. Oh yeah, I'm... Alright, well, we split up. We haven't split up
much this game. It's kind of weird doing
this without Scotty, but... Yeah, so I'm pretty much
just kind of waiting to see if Ben makes a move at this point. In a way, just me sitting here, if that keeps Ben where he is now, that buys time for
Scotty, which is great. So, I'm pretty much on
Ben monitoring duty right now. Okay, so right now,
I'm waiting on the platform that their Shinkansen would arrive. But it seems like they both
got off a couple stops earlier and Scotty is running off,
God knows where. And Sam... is just hanging out. I don't know why. I don't know what the deal is. But I'm just gonna keep
an eye on them, stay here. I still think this is
the most strategic spot. I don't wanna make any hasty moves, just 'cause they're
doing something weird. That's what they want me to do.
I'm not gonna do it. I'm just gonna hang out
here at lovely Ōmiya. And... wait for their inevitable demise. Alright, Ben's
still down at Ōmiya. Hasn't really made a move yet. So I'm still gonna wait this out,
see if he makes a move, and kind of just wait to respond
to his move, pretty much. I don't really wanna do
anything until he does. I kind of want to keep
this stalemate, 'cause it buys time for Scotty. So if you haven't noticed, the game is in kind of an
odd position right now. Scotty has a flag and is
beginning his return unopposed. Adam is heading towards
a flag, also unopposed. And Ben and I,
the two people who you'd expect to be
chasing after the flag carriers, are locked in a stalemate. But what's strange is,
as you might have noticed, we both believe that stalemate
is good for our team. My plan is pretty simple: stall Ben until Scotty is
close enough to the line that Ben can't stop him. At which point,
I'll either go for the near flag or go on defense to stop Adam, with Scotty coming in to support. Ben's plan is also
relatively simple: stay at Ōmiya and
stall me long enough that Adam can get to
their flag and get back, which would win them the round, as they've already
returned their near flag. It's all gonna come
down to the timing. And frankly, it's hard
to tell who's right. Scotty has to take a lot of
slow regional lines back, but Adam's flag is
inconveniently located and requires several transfers. Plus he doesn't have the coins to
get back without doing challenges. Basically it's a speedrun with
a staring contest at the center. So let's see who can run faster. Nothing like a midday jog. It's pretty, if nothing else. It's gorgeous here. Some beautiful tulips up here. Dig deep. Dig deep. Okay, where do I go now? Where is the train station? Down here? I don't know. Don't understand that.
Come on. Crap. I'm at Toyohashi. Here at Toyohashi Station, and... I have to get on the Meitetsu
Limited Express to Shin Anjō, and then I'm gonna transfer
from there to a different train to get me to Nishio,
where the flag is. Alright. Meitetsu Line... there. Okay. Excuse me. Sumimasen. Okay. I'm at Shin Anjō Station. and I just have to transfer—
(conductor blows whistle) Oh, that scared me. I don't know if you heard me
breaking out my sumimasen. That means
""excuse me"" or ""I'm sorry."" And it is one of the three
Japanese phrases that I learned. I considered for a while
learning how to say ""I don't speak Japanese."" But I kind of figured that they
would be able to figure that out, sort of just based on context. So, I just stuck to the three: Kon'nichiwa... Arigatō gozaimasu, which is like ""thank you."" People say that all the time here. And then sumimasen,
which is really my go-to. I'm just sort of always
telling people, ""Sumimasen."" I'm just kind of sorry
for being around. I'm sorry for, you know... not knowing what I'm doing,
et cetera, sumimasen. Alright. Three stops,
five minute walk, and I'll have the flag. It's taken a while,
but we're gonna get it. (breathes heavily) I dunno. Aha, I found it. Okay. For Tochigi. That's a welcome
sight for sore eyes. Looks like
Scotty made his train. That's awesome. My man has been
getting his steps in. And Ben, still at Ōmiya. Okay, so it looks like
Scotty has started taking this very slow local line
that goes nowhere. So presumably he's just trying
to take a very long-winded way back to their territory. And I'm not gonna fall for that. I'm not gonna go chase after him
and let them both get back. But they're burning
daylight, you know? And that's what we want right now. I think we can buy ourselves
enough time to win this round. Adam's just gotta move quickly. It's very beautiful here. It's very charming. Okay! I've made it
to Nishio Station. Let's go get the damn flag. Okay. The flag... is just up here. Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Ooh, fun! It's a little apple drink, okay. And folks... that is the flag! Okay, so, I only
have 250 coins left, and I need about 2,000
to get back. Coming on track two. So, it's about a mile walk from here to the next
station that I have to go to. So I'm hoping that I'm gonna
pull cards that I can do while I'm on that walk. Alright, let's pull a card. Quick shuffle... and... Eat an egg. It may be in any form, but must recognizably
be an actual egg. You must eat roughly
one egg's worth of egg. The egg cannot be completely raw. Okay, this
should be very doable. Very, very doable. Okay. Unfortunately, not a lot of coins. I'm gonna need a lot more,
and it's a 600, so the intervals aren't
very good for me. But that's okay. I'm going to find an egg. Okay. I'm just gonna start walking
towards that station, and I'm imagining that
I'll pass somewhere where I can buy
an egg on the way. Okay, so I'm gonna
call Sam and figure out a plan here. Hey.
Hang on one sec. Let me make sure
I'm getting audio, yeah. So, I just got off the
train in Tochigi... and I've got about 45
minutes until my next train, which puts me across the
line around 12:45 pm? Okay. Because my only worry is Adam
seemingly just got to the flag. So that kind of puts us at a
three-hour countdown clock. Yes. I don't think I have good options
that are not through Ōmiya. Okay.
Where Ben is. Basically at a certain point, I think I might need to make a
Shinkansen gamble through there. Is there any reason
not to do that now? Well, the question is,
I guess... Can Ben get to you in the time that he
would have after that? I don't know. Let me spend some time
researching that and call you back. All I can do is
sit here and look scary. Arrgh. Arrgh. That should do the trick. Ah, crap. I think we might have
a serious problem here. He can get to... ...Ino, where I'm
headed in 45 minutes. Because there's a Shinkansen
that goes to Takasaki. That's a problem. So just to clarify here,
Scotty's just figured out that Ben has a much faster path to
cutting him off than we realized. That's because
Ōmiya Station, where Ben is, is both a choke point
and a hub. It's connected to
two Shinkansen lines, so if Ben goes up this line, he could get to where Scotty
is headed in about 45 minutes. That means to keep Scotty safe, I'll have to stall Ben even
longer before making a move, which means our tightly
timed plan is starting to look a little less airtight. As you may be able to tell, I was not thrilled by this news. Mm-kay. That's not great.
It's not great. So... Maybe you need to
ramp up the risk? I think so. I think you need to
put pressure on him. Yeah, this is not looking as
great as it did a little while ago. No, it's not.
What do you think? So basically then, I'm gonna wait for
the next Shinkansen, which is 40 minutes from now. Okay. Yep.
And then take that in. And see if I can get through.
You think that's the best bet? I think so. I think we'll keep him busy,
if nothing else. Yeah. Yeah, I don't love it,
but I think yeah, we need to ramp up the risk. Yeah, I'm worried
that Adam's just gonna beat us in now, so... I think we do have to move.
Yeah, that's a real issue. Let's find an egg. This place sells sewing machines. They won't have eggs. Oh, supermarket, okay. Alright. Alright, presumably
I need to find... a refrigerated area, okay. This is not a supermarket. This is the supermarket. Okay! Something with a
cooked egg in it. What is this? That does not look like egg. Is that egg? It looks like egg. Let's try taking a— Let's try translating this guy. Here we go. ""Torn egg""! Yeah. Oh, great, okay. That's an egg. That's egg. Let's go, let's go, let's go. We've done it.
Folks, we've done it. Okay. Alright, everybody. Welcome to The Snack Zone! It's a show within a show
where we review Japan's best and worst foods. Today we'll be trying
""torn egg"". Oh, it's bizarrely sweet. Alright. Challenge complete. (in Japanese)
...is my request, please! Alright. Time to draw another challenge. Alright. And... Cursed! You must turn the language
settings on your research phone to Japanese
for the next two hours. You must also only use
the Japanese keyboard. Use of apps is allowed. Ah-ah-aah-aaah! (sniffle, whimper) Okay. Okay. It's fine. I already know what
trains I'm going to take. And... I already know... how I'm going to get back. (shivering) Alright, let's do this. Oh god. With this curse, Adam now
has all the coins he needs, but to actually return the flag, he'll have to successfully complete
the following solely from memory: Walk to and find Anjō Station,
which is almost a mile away, where he'll have
to manage to get on the local Tōkaidō Line,
going towards Nagoya – actually going the
opposite way from Tokyo – then get off at
Mikawa-Anjō Station, where he'll then have to
get on a Kodama Shinkansen going towards Tokyo. Scotty, on the other hand, is having a bit of trouble
even with his phone in English. After microwaving some noodles at
a 7-Eleven before his next train, he took out his phone to
find the right platform, and while he thought
he was filming, but was actually taking a
picture of his left arm, began to realize he's gone to the
complete wrong part of the station, prompting the most cursing
we've heard from him all game. (bleep) What? (bleep) Ah (bleep) Okay. Anjō Station here. Good start. Okay, so logically... I would be going towards Nagoya. As that says. 11:06... track two. Track two. Alright, train's here. Sumimasen. Takasaki?
Takasaki... Okay. (titters) Arigatō gozaimasu. (warning chime) Whoop. (warning chime) (warning chime) (speaking Japanese) Pass.
Okay. (speaking Japanese)
Arigatō gozaimasu. I'm in trouble. Alright,
Shinkansen station... This way. For Shizuoka and Tokyo. Alright. Let's see if they can stop me! So it looks like
Adam is headed back on the Shinkansen now
with the flag. Which is not great. This is gonna be a
race down to the wire. We have to go
get our other flag. Hopefully, Sam's on the move. Okay, well about 10 minutes
to my Shinkansen. To be honest, I don't love
the position we're in. Ben and Adam are
playing this smart. They are being diligent
with their strategy. I thought they would
get tantalized by Scotty running off to the west
and looking like he has the flag. But... no. They were smart.
They're smart. And Ben is just staying put
in a really good spot, 'cause he has really good
mobility from that station. And it's a choke point, so... I don't love this, but I
think that's why we have to start applying pressure. The main thing I need
to figure out is, am I gonna stay on or
am I gonna get off? Which is just like
classic game theory. I don't really know.
I think I'm just gonna kind of feel it out
in the moment, you know? So, now I'm heading in the
direction to the station where Ben is waiting for me, but there's one way I might
be able to slip past him. You see, Ben doesn't know
whether I'm planning on getting off my train
at the station or staying on it. That means that if
I get off the train, but he thinks I'm staying on it
and boards the train to tag me, I'll send him away
and free me up to take a different
train outta the station. If I stay on the train, but
he thinks I'm getting off it, then he'll wait for me
on the platform while I just blow right past him. All of this, of course,
assumes that Ben doesn't have some sort of crazy way
of forcing me off the train. Well, it looks like Sam
is finally heading for me. So, it's time to put down
the ol' Pizza Tower. I'll let them know. Ben dropped the Pizza Tower. Which means I need to get off. Which means I have virtually
no chance getting past Ōmiya. Which is lame. Oh, hold on.
Adam's calling me. Yeah, okay, so I think
it's clear that Sam probably doesn't even care that much
if he gets tagged or not, because he's gonna go after me. So just like... As much as you can,
stall him. Like you— you know— You could wait
on the platform and not catch him
technically yet. Yeah. So I'm gonna... I'm not gonna tag him, but the freeze period
is gonna matter. So I'm gonna want to
tag him eventually, but I'm gonna hold off
as long as I can. Okay, bye. Alright, here we go. Got basically no shot with
the Pizza Tower thing. But might as well give
it a shot, you know? Waste a little bit more
of his time or something. Okay, so Sam knows
that the Pizza Tower's here, so he is gonna be forced off
to get onto this station. But what he
doesn't know is that I'm also placing down
the Trap Tower. So once he's forced off
the train right here... I'm gonna go ahead and trap him. And that's gonna freeze
him for 30 minutes. And then after that,
I can tag him, send him back to Tokyo Station,
freeze him for another 30 minutes. And so that hopefully in total should buy Adam enough
time to get back before he can go on defense.
That's the plan. So... Sam should now be getting off. Okay, Sam is now in the
radius of the Trap Tower. So I'm gonna go ahead and
inform him that he is trapped. And then we'll go find him. I've been frozen. Ben froze me. This sucks. So I would guess that he's
gonna come tag me in a second? There he is. He's the one who's
supposed to be filming me. Hello, Sam.
Hello, Ben. Stay put. I have no other option. Okay. I have Sam not on camera. I'm not tagging him.
Sam, say hi. Hi, Ben. That's Sam on camera. So, he's here. We're not tagging him. And that's not
a great camera angle. We're just waiting. I don't want you
to get in the shot, because then you'll be tagged.
Okay. So... We're waiting. Alright. We're waiting for the
freeze period to be up. Sam, do you want
anything from Starbucks? It's right over there. It's right over there. Maybe. Okay, I'll get you
some Starbys. So what is it
with your guys' team and sitting at—
sitting still for four hours? I would like to think that you
were sitting still for four hours. I was waiting for you to come. Why would I have done that? That would've been stupid. To capture me. I didn't wanna do that.
I didn't wanna capture you. Why not?
I still don't wanna capture you. I could capture you right now.
We're not doing it. Okay. You know, it's called
Capture the Flag. And we're about to
capture the second flag. Yeah? Okay. How many flags has
your team captured, Sam? Is this a Snack Zone? (hums dramatically) It actually tastes really bad. I don't know why
I keep getting this. I don't know.
I don't like Starbucks. Alright, Ben, it's almost time. So you gonna tag me or... we're gonna go get pizza? Okay. Well, Sam gets out of
his freeze in a minute. But, I still haven't tagged him. And... Sam, if you haven't realized this, what I need to be doing right now is wasting as much of
your time as possible. What? So... You do have to go get pizza,
but I'm gonna be pointing... This is like, I have a
loaded gun pointed at you. If you try any funny business... you know, I can send
you right back to Tokyo. Alright. Okay, it's 12:21. You're free. Okay, bye.
No. Okay. I'm... Don't you go anywhere. Don't you find any pizza. There better not be
any pizza in here. I'm not gonna point
the camera at you. No pizza. This does not seem like a
very pizza-forward country. Alright, Ben, we're going out. Alright, my JR Pass
isn't working. So Sam, I'm tagging you. Ugh, okay. Alright, I'm free. Let's go to Tokyo Station. Bye, Ben!
Bye, Sam. Unless, do you wanna
come with me? I mean, I guess I
actually have no idea what I should do at this point. And I don't think I'm
getting to Scotty. Scotty's kind of in the
middle of nowhere right now. I guess you didn't— So I guess you know
where our flag is. I figured you
didn't have the flag. But it would've been kind of a
cool 4D chess move if you did. I'll come to Tokyo. I don't think that being here
is doing anything for me. So I'm probably gonna
go back to Tokyo too. I bet Adam's being
pretty smug right now. Well, no he's not. He never feels smug
right until the very, very
last minute, but... I think we should have a new
motion graphic element in Jet Lag. Which is a live Adam
heart rate monitor. Yeah. He's... Sometimes he calls me and
there's like, not even... I can't even tell what he's saying. (laughs) Hello, Adam. I have tagged Sam and... He's going back to Tokyo. I'm also going back to Tokyo. I'm kind of useless at this point. Yeah, I don't know. Ben. Yeah? Could Scotty
get back fast enough? Get tickets for you? Yeah, for me. I don't believe so. Just check, okay? 'Cause I think that
if he can't, it's not by much. 'Cause he's about to
get to a Shinkansen line that'll take him to Tokyo quickly. Okay. Okay, it might be
closer than you think. Bye, Adam.
Bye, buddy. Well, here it is. Flag officially across the line. One down, one to go. I think the bigger question is... can we stop Adam from bringing
his flag over the line? Sam got tagged, he's headed
back to Tokyo Station. So I think it's up to me
to try and block Adam here. So I've gotta take a Shinkansen
down to Tokyo Station, and then transfer and head out on the line that
Adam's on, two stops. So, I'm hoping I can
do that in time. Okay, here we go. Platform 14. The Shinkansen is this way. Shinkansen... this way. I don't know what stop I'm at. Oh, I'm pulling into Ōmiya. Oh crap. And there's a
Pizza Tower active here. Crap. I forgot about that. I have to go get pizza. Damn it. I mean, I don't really think
I had a choice, but... Alright, Ben has confirmed. Scotty cannot get to me. (mouth click) I think that means
round two is over. In... about an hour once I get back. Mount Fuji. More like Mount Wahoo-ee. 'Cause we're gonna win the round. Alright, hi,
I'm in this station. I don't even know
what station I'm in. I just got on the first
train I could outta Tokyo. You know what? While I'm here, might as well do a
challenge or two, while we wait for Adam. Let's see... Let's see if we can get an
easy one and just knock it out. I think that's pretty shuffled. Top one. Break copyright law. Break copyright law. Find at least four places where we'll have to mute the audio
for copyright reasons. Each place must be
at least 100 feet apart from any other selected place. You may not initiate the playing
of any sound on any device. Okay. That might be a little tough
with the remaining time, but... I can certainly give it a go. I guess I'll leave the station and look for stores
that might be playing music. Let's see if this Starbucks has
any copywritten music playing. There was for sure
music playing in there, which we can't play for you
for the obvious reasons, but that's one down, three to go. I have to make sure that
Sam doesn't come after me once he's... out of his freeze period. Because if he gets all
1,530 of his coins back, that's gonna be really annoying. So, well, we'll keep
an eye out for him too. I hear music over there.
I'm gonna go over there. Alright, Adam's left
Shin-Yokohama. So that's pretty much it. So the one thing I'm gonna do now is head down to Shimbashi
Station, where Ben is, just to see if I can
catch him, just in case, before Adam gets here. And that way,
I can steal his coins. Would be nice, at least. I hear something over there. This thing, this thing
is playing music. It's a new digital single by Tee. I bet any amount of
money that this... Pachinko place has got some
copyrighted music going. Let's go in there. That'll be fun. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Okay, that was the
most stressful place I've ever been in my entire life. But I got like at least 150
more copyrighted songs, so... I think that's challenge complete. Alright, now I just kinda
gotta not get caught by Sam until Adam wins us the round. So I'm just gonna wander... in an unpredictable pattern... until the end of the round. See you then. Ben Doyle,
you just got caught! I just looked at the tracker! So you decided
to walk towards me? No, it showed you
still in Tokyo Station two minutes ago.
(laughs) Oh, that makes me
feel so much better. Even if this round
did not go our way. You did a challenge? Alright, Sam.
Enjoy 2,530 coins. Oh, that's pretty good. Do you wanna head
back to Tokyo Station? That makes me
feel so much better. It's gonna give us a nice— That was a nice
little present, Ben. 2,530, wow.
That is generous, man. Thank you. You're gonna need it. Ben got tagged. (chuckles weakly) Over the line. (slapping thigh) Round two in the bag, baby.
Let's go! Alright, Sam,
I've just been informed that Adam has arrived here at Tokyo Station.
What? I know, crazy, right? That means round two is over. Oh no. We've got three points. Well, luckily, next round
is worth three points. Yep, so you can tie it up.
So we can still tie it up. And go to the sudden death. I don't love that though.
Death round. That's not great. We'll see what
happens next round. 'Cause it's gonna get complicated. Oh yeah. Well, damn. I was feeling so confident at
the beginning of this round. I'm not quite sure
where we went wrong. I think... Maybe we need to consider
playing defense next round. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Round three: the entire
country of Japan is in play. There are three flags on the map. Three points on the line. Will Scotty and I
managed to tie it up and force us into a
sudden death elimination round? Or will Ben and Adam finish
the game right here, right now? Well, it all starts, episode four. Which is coming next
week on YouTube. Or you can watch it right now,
this instant, on Nebula. That's because every single
episode of Jet Lag comes out one week
early on Nebula, which means the next
episode is always up there. We also do a Nebula-exclusive
podcast called The Layover. It's where we dive
deeper into the episodes and really take you behind
the scenes of what happens. And this week is
a really fun one because I think all of the teams learned
a lot from round two especially and had to make a lot of
adjustments to their strategy. Scotty and I definitely did. (guffaws) Yeah.
Yeah. So in this episode, we really break down
all of round two and how all of the lessons
that we learned from that and sort of discuss and
debate what the takeaways are and how we use that to
prep for round three that we're going into.
Mhm. And subscribing to Nebula
doesn't just get you Jet Lag perks. It also gets you access
to this massive catalog of amazing original content. I mean, it's like, feature-length
documentaries, original series, stage plays, extra videos from all
your favorite creators, things a week early. I... Are you making fun of me? No!
Oh. I'm emphasizing your point.
I love Nebula. Nebula's, again, it's probably one
of my most used streaming services. I... Now you're making fun of me. No, we're not.
Everyone's making fun of me! No, Ben, you're being paranoid. Subscribe to Nebula.
It's a great— There's so much good stuff from
all your favorite creators. I'm gonna kill Adam. Okay, Adam is
making fun of you. That's kind of rude, yeah. Anyway. It's also good for
the creators because we actually founded it. Myself and a bunch
of my creator friends a couple years ago came
together and we were like, ""What would a streaming site look
like if the creators ran it?"" So we really wanted to
make a better experience for the creators and
for the audience. So for the audience,
we of course do everything that we just talked about. You know, early stuff,
exclusive stuff. There's also, by the way,
no ads, no sponsorships, no algorithm getting in the way. So it's really a clean,
content-first platform. But then it's also, you know,
a better thing for the creators. You know, for example, one of the
big thing that feeds into that is when you sign up using
our link, nebula.tv/jetlag, we actually get a portion
of your subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed. So that gives us predictable,
recurring monthly revenue that is not— doesn't really
have the ebb and flow of ad rates. We can rely on that revenue
to reinvest in the show, make it bigger, better,
cooler, greater, everything. But also when you use that link, you'll actually get $20 off
an annual subscription, which is awesome. So yeah, make sure to
click the button on screen or the link in the
description to sign up. And thank you in advance
for your support. Pound it, noggin! What was that? That's what Dude Perfect
does at the end of their videos. Oh.
I don't watch Dude Perfect. I don't like that.
They go, ""Pound it, noggin!"" and then they go, then run off. Oh, okay. Bye!
Bye."

to episode two of our four-day game of
Capture the Flag across Japan. We're still in round one,
which means right now, it's just Capture the Flag
across Tokyo, but trust me, it'll get bigger. In this game, teams must use Japan's notoriously
complicated rail network to go into enemy territory,
capture their opponent's flag, and return it to their territory,
all without being caught. That's what Ben was
up to last episode when I caught him, sending him
back to Tokyo Station to wait out a
30 minute jail period. My partner, Scotty and I are
heading to enemy territory so we can do
challenges, earn coins, and fund our run to
Ben and Adam's flag, which means that by coincidence,
we're taking the same train as Ben, making him the first guest
on our brand new, totally not derivative
snack review show. Adam, we have stolen your teammate, and now we're gonna indoctrinate
him into our snack show. We happen to be on
the same train, so... Ben, I would like to welcome
you to this special edition of Choo Choo Chew! This feels very derivative. It's a better name. Today on Choo Choo Chew!, we have for your pleasure, a kiwi chia seed drink. Ooh.
It looks fun. It's very pulpy. How many choos out of chew? Mm, choo-choo. Hey buddy. He got me.
He gotcha. Alright. Back by the flag, back on defense. Bye, Ben.
Good luck, gents. You're gonna need it. Right. With Ben now at Tokyo Station, he has to wait out
30 minutes of jail time. That means we have 30 minutes to get enough coins to
make our run at the flag before he can hunt us down. So we better hurry. Alright. Welcome back to
Shinagawa, Scotty. I want that
one right there. Find three new friends. Find three new friends. Find three different
species of living, non-bug, non-bird,
non-human animals. You must clearly
capture them on camera. That's not too bad. I can do that. Yeah, we can do that.
Alright, let's do it. Okay, there's a
Shinagawa Central Garden. Okay.
Right near here. Gotta get your steps in, Scotty! Oh god! But I'm old! Adam is still at the flag. Freaking camper. I know, what's going on? He's gotta be getting
bored by this point. Maybe he's eating noodles. There's a bird,
but bird doesn't count. Bird doesn't count. I think let's go to that garden.
Find some squirrels and stuff. They have
squirrels in Japan? I think so? Hello? You have a dog? Dog, please. I'm not loving this, Sam. No.
Where's all the dogs? And the squirrels? If this was China, we
could just go to a Walmart and we'd be done in five minutes. Knowing how
many birds there are. I can't believe
there's no squirrels. It's just so disappointing.
Not a surprise. There is an aquarium nearby. Ooh, let's do that. It's a 12 minute walk though. Okay.
It's not nothing. That might
be worth the time. Okay, so I have a while
before anybody gets here. There's basically three
ways into this area, probably less than
a mile between them. So I'm just gonna go visit
them and familiarize myself so that when they do
start to get here, I can handle it. That's all the prep I can do.
I'm gonna wait in the middle. Maxell Aqua Park. It seemed like it was in here. Oh, there's a movie theater. Oh, here.
Yep. Here's one. Sam, there's two species in here. Well, I think
we're gonna see plenty. Here, fish. Definitely fish. I don't know if we count fish as
one big species or not, but... No, it's... Fish is not a species, Sam. Sam, explain to us
what a species is. It's kind of like a breed. It's kind of like a breed. It's not really a breed. Whoa! It's like Disney World. Half of the challenge is getting
out of this fricking maze. Look! Jellyfish.
Jellyfish. Aren't species the ones that can... Yes.
Nice. Dolphins! Do a jump. Do a flip. Do a flip. Do a flip. Do a flip. Sam, sharks! I'm trying to get outta here. This is kind of like
the worst nightmare. The entire dolphin
show just let out. Time to exit through the gift shop. Alright, so back to Shinagawa. How many did we earn?
I was amazed, 750 each. That feels like
it was underpriced, but... Well...
I'll take it. Alright, I am
back in the game. Sam and Scotty are
still at Shinagawa... I guess, doing a
challenge or something, so I can get there very quickly. And I'm just gonna hop on
the first train outta here and start putting pressure on 'em. Maybe I could steal my coins back. That'd be nice. I earned those. It looks like Ben
maybe just got on a train. In which
case we should move. In which case we should
definitely move very quickly. He's in the station
south of Tokyo Station. Yeah. Which doesn't make sense
if he's doing a challenge. Because that's in the neutral zone. So I think he's
probably coming for us. Okay. In which case,
maybe we wanna split up? No, I think we
just get on a train that doesn't have a Ben on it. Alright, here, pull a card. Pick a card, any card. Oh, paint or draw
a local landscape. Paint or draw a local landscape. You must use at least three colors. You must cover at least
75% of the canvas. The painting does
not need to be good, but it must be reasonably
recognizable as the landscape you're painting. You must spend a
minimum of 15 minutes in a single location
drawing/painting. If you move, you may restart. That is gonna take some time. That is one to hang
onto for a little while. Yeah. That one's not great. I don't love that.
It's not great. What line do we need
'em to be on now? Yeah, if we're going
straight to the flag... Oh, I guess we can take this and then go on foot. But Adam's gonna be
able to cut us off. Okay, so it looks like
they're back in the station now. The question's gonna be,
what time do they leave? Because they have a
lot of options here. And I don't know...
(nervous laugh) which one they're gonna take. Oh, look. Ben's coming after them. They're gonna have to
do something! Ben is on his
way to us right now, so we should move, move, move. Okay, lemme just
make sure this is right. Is that right? Yeah, Keikyū Main Line.
Yep. ~Wait, I'm not a hundred
percent sure this is right. ~It is not. We're going north. How did—
I don't know what— I don't understand how we mess— I mean, this actually
might work in our favor. Let's go back to Tokyo. Yes? And then
take something fast. I guess. I suspect Ben is
very confused right now. Okay, so I just got off
here at Tamachi Gateway... because it looks like Sam
and Scotty started heading back the direction I came. What could they be doing?
Where could they be going? I don't know what to do. Okay. They turned around
and went backwards. I'm going to Shinagawa
to meet up with Ben. There's no point in
me waiting back here. I can get to Shinagawa
in 20 minutes. So, that's the plan. So what is
our plan though, Sam? So the plan is we're
gonna get off the last stop before Tokyo Station, get stationery supplies,
and then evaluate from there whether we have the time to
do the 15 minutes of drawing. Based on what
Ben does, basically. Okay, I don't know
what they're doing, but I'm just gonna
get on the first train going back their direction, just so that we can keep
chasing them around. And... hopefully we'll just figure it out. Yeah, that'll work.
We'll just figure it out. I love that plan. Here we go.
Here's a black one. Here's a highlighter.
I think that's good. Do you want to navigate us to
just outside of the neutral zone? Yep. Because I think that's
where we want to attempt this. Yep. So that we can abandon
and dip back in if we need to. Go through here?
Oh yeah, that works. Ooh, this is fun. Oh, yeah. Alright, so Ben is... Ben's hot on our tail. Is he?
Yeah. Okay. Well, let's go hang out right on
the edge of the neutral zone then. Yeah. Okay. So they're right outside
of Tokyo Station, I think right outside the
neutral zone, doing challenges. So... I'm gonna leave... and... go after them. Should hopefully at least
make it harder for them to do whatever it is
that they're trying to do. The edge is right
there, basically. Okay, we need to start it quick. Okay. Okay, you can't
even really see, but they're right
outside the neutral zone. Down this way. Obviously they know I'm here. But... all I can do is... go towards them and follow them and see where they're headed. Okay, it's pencil. So does that count as
different than black marker? Eh... Do you want me to go get
another color just to be sure? Sure. Okay, I'll be right back. It seems like they're
just down this street. I'm gonna put my phone
away and just run. Scotty! Come on in. Come on in the neutral zone. He's coming. I'm right on top of them. Where are they? I think he's right on
the other side of the street. Yeah, yeah, come on, come on.
Quickly, quickly, quickly. This was the line.
Okay. So we're good. Yeah, so considering that, I think we should
head to Tokyo Station. Okay. 'Cause we're gonna need
to probably take a train out to complete this challenge. To build the time to do it. Okay. Okay, so let's walk that
way towards Tokyo Station. Are they down... here? They might be down here. I'm gonna guess that
they're down here. Let's see... Let's see if I can go down here. Okay, so... That didn't work.
And Ben is right around here. And, you know, looks like— Oh, sorry, shades need to go on. Looks like Adam has
decided to join the game. Yes.
He's in Shinagawa Station. You know, one thing that
we could consider – it's a little bit high risk – is taking a Shinkansen outta here
to the northern Yokohama stop. Just so you know, the Shinkansen,
also known as the bullet train, is Japan's super high-speed,
super limited-stop line. If we could get past Adam on it, we'd be on a rocket to the flag. I like that idea. The only problem though is if Adam's in... We wouldn't wanna do that
if Adam is in Shinagawa, because then he would pretty safely
be able to figure out where we are and probably get on the train. But would he know
that we're on a Shinkansen? Not necessarily
with confidence, but he could figure
it out pretty quickly by the fact that the train
did not stop before there. If he's at Shinagawa, I think we're basically
have a free pass through. I don't think he's gonna
be able to figure it out. In a way, we're just
waiting to see what Adam does. But yeah, let's at least
get to the Shinkansen's stop. Yeah, I think
that's a good next move. Alright. Okay, so Adam... it seems like they're
back in Tokyo Station. Okay.
So... I mean, I could try and go out. I can't tag them.
I could try and go after them. But even that,
in this station, it seems... less than likely
that I'll find them. Okay, so...
So what should we do? Okay, here's
what I think you do. Follow them.
Try not to be seen. See if you can find out
what train they get on. Then you could tell me,
and then I could get 'em. I would try to find them,
and if you don't, then you've only wasted
a few minutes anyway. Okay, alright.
I'm gonna head that way. Okay, sounds good, bye. Alright, while I wait,
I'm buying a gachapon. Whoa, you can get a lizard? That's pretty awesome. Here we go! It's so hard to open. Alright, back
to Tokyo Station. Yep. Oh, here we go. This way. Okay, so... Sam and Scotty are
somewhere in Tokyo Station. The tracker is just
not that precise, so... It's not gonna help me a lot. Again, I can't tag them in there, but I can at least
try and find them and figure out where
they might be going next. This way. Straight ahead now. Seems like they're right here. They've gotta be
somewhere in this room. I'm looking for Scotty.
Scotty's very easy to spot. He's tall and ginger,
like a giant beacon. No, no, now they're back this way. Simple thing.
15, over here. So question is,
do we wanna get on this? That's a good question. So Adam still is in Shinagawa. Seemingly. I still think we're
gonna breeze through. I don't know. It is a choke point. I don't think he's gonna
be thinking Shinkansen. They on a platform? What track is that? Are they on the Shinkansen? It looks like they're on
the side of the station that serves Shinkansen trains. Yeah, we have three minutes
to decide whether to get on this. I think we
just roll the dice. Agh. I don't think he's
gonna catch us on this. I mean, so... You just want to roll the dice? I mean, I feel like this
is a predictable move. I don't think he's
gonna be able to figure out what platform to get
on, and it's fine. Yeah, this rocks. I'm gonna name him... I'm gonna name him Chris. Oh, I'm getting a call. Hello? Adam, I think
that they're on the— I think they're on the side of the
station that serves the Shinkansen. So see if you can do anything
with that information. Side with the Shinkansen.
Got it, got it, okay. Okay, sounds good, bye. Okay... No time for this. I'm gonna go station myself
over by Shinkansen lines. Alright, let's go. Shinkansen. Let's do it. You just roll the dice?
Yeah. Alright, rolling the dice. So, this is definitely
a roll of the dice. I just have faith
that this is gonna be really hard to figure out. These are the Shinkansens. They would be headed
towards Ōsaka. Yeah, I don't love this. I don't have
a great feeling about this. I have a good feeling. You have a good feeling about this?
Good feeling. Oh, they're on the move. Oh shoot, they're on the move! Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay. When did they leave?
When did they leave? Just now. Okay. Yeah, yeah, I see they left.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're on the Shin-Ōsaka. They're on the Shin-Ōsaka. I gotta figure out which one. That wouldn't be them. That wouldn't be them. Okay, okay. Okay, so Adam is
still in Shinagawa. Yep. So... this is definitely a gamble. Yeah. (grumbles) Okay, well let's see if
he's on the platform. We'll be able to tell
if he's on the platform. And maybe if he's on the
platform and he gets on, then we both get off. Theoretically. And then he's stuck on a
Shinkansen for the next 18 minutes. Shoot. I guess we could try to
spot him from over there. Yeah, let's just
look out the window. Well, maybe we should get
at the door and try to spot him. Okay.
As we roll onto the platform. Okay, okay. I'm almost positive they're gonna
be on a train coming in here. Okay, I'm taking my hat off
to be a little less recognizable. Alright.
Why is this better than looking out the window? Just 'cause this way
we can pop out immediately. Okay. Okay, I'm pretty sure their
train's gonna be coming here. There it is. Okay. Now here's the question. Do they get off it? Oh, this is going way fast. Haven't seen him yet. Haven't seen him yet. There he is. I just saw him. Oh (bleep). I saw them! I saw them. I saw them. I saw them. I saw them filming. Okay, well we need to pop off. Here, Scotty, hurry up, hurry up. Okay. I have to see if they get off. Ready?
~So, we need to hop
off at the last minute. ~Hop off and hide. I got 'em, I got 'em! Hello, gentlemen! See you later! Well...
I thought we— Whatever, I'm not gonna discuss it. Yeah. Hello? Hello? I got 'em. I got 'em, Ben. You got 'em? Okay. I'm working
on getting to you. We're gonna travel together,
make a run for it. Boy, he's
had some caffeine! Well, he hasn't been
doing anything all day. (cackles) Oh my god. This rocks, okay! I'm gonna have Ben
meet me on this train. We're gonna do the attack together. Hell yeah. (chuckles deviously) Okay, alright, welcome
to Shin-Nihombashi. Adam is gonna get here
in 20 minutes, and basically all we need is
one challenge's worth of coins to get all the way,
do the full run. While Adam heads here, I'm gonna see if I can
just get a challenge done. I'm gonna have to
shuffle with one hand. Okay, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle. My card is... Get a snack on a stick. Get a snack on a stick. It must be on the stick
when you buy it. Let's see if
we can do that here. No. None of those are snacks on sticks. Okay, okay, okay, okay. This station does not seem to
have a lot in the way of snacks. Note to self:
don't do that again. Yeah, that was
a good learning lesson. Yeah. Yeah, part of this is,
not having played this before, it's a little bit
hard to figure out some of the real minute
real-world interactions of... Yeah. How hard is it gonna
be to catch somebody and stuff. Yeah.
But lesson learned. Harder— Easier than I thought. Yeah. Okay, okay, this... This is definitely
a snack on a stick. Okay. Snack on a stick acquired. Alright. Train is here. Gonna get on. Feeling good. Hey buddy. I can't believe that we're here... ...in The Snack Zone! ~This is bad. (wheezes) Alright, so that was not rad. No. No, I am kicking myself here. Yeah.
It was a learning lesson for someone who's never
played the game before. Learning experience.
Don't need to dwell on the past. Have you checked
where they are recently? Seems like they're moving.
Oh, they're on a train now. Uuuugghh. That's not... so not rad. Here's the issue.
A little ways away. Adam... got a lot of coins.
Has a bunch of coins. And the real issue
is the fact that— is the geography.
Yeah. Where they can just
continue to outrun us all the way to there. What are our
options right now? So at a certain point
in the day... there is a strategic
advantage to kind of cutting our losses
for this round, because our coin balance
carries over to the next. Yep. So if we think that
they're gonna get this, there is some logic to just
kind of letting them do it, and doing some challenges
to earn the coins to be able to set ourselves up for
a really strong start next round. I don't emotionally love it. I don't emotionally
love it either. But, I do see
the raw logic in it. Yeah, you gotta look at the logic. Okay. I also don't love it.
It feels wrong. Yeah, it doesn't
fill me with joy. Especially cause we
were on top of the world just 30 minutes ago.
I know, I know. But on the bright side, we will be able to
start next round strong. Yes. Alright, so I... The tracker could be wrong, but it looks like they've
left Tokyo Station. And they're probably
just doing a challenge. I think they've given up. I think they've realized
that they can't catch us. Which... they are right about. Yeah. I mean they
could've gone after us, but what they're doing
seems pretty smart to me. We don't have to go back. We can just go around. Yeah, their chances of
catching us are so low... That it makes sense
for them to just get a head start in the next round. So, I think we might have
round one in the bag. So basically the next hour
is just us doing challenges. But because you already know
who's gonna win this round, let's just summarize. Scotty and I went to a lovely
spot to draw our landscape, which turned out... fine. Then pulled our next card, which required us to kawaii-ify
ten of our belongings, making them adorable by
giving them eyes and mouths, which I think you have
to admit, we nailed. Then we pulled
Play Pocky Hockey, requiring us to hit
a piece of Pocky into a Pocky box
with a Pocky stick, which we also nailed. If by nailed you mean
only made it on our last attempt
before force-veto. All of which put us both
at a healthy 3,250 coins. Meanwhile, Ben and Adam
made it to the flag. Adam left Ben behind
to run and grab it, because you know, I don't
really need to explain that. Brought it back, and
then had to wait a while for their train to victory, so figured they should
also do some challenges. They pulled Go Super-Saiyan, requiring them to gel
their hair straight up, which looked amazing and
earned them 750 coins. Kamehameha! Then they had to make sushi, which for reasons
beyond comprehension, they did with bacon filling
and dried squid on top, which no surprise,
did not taste amazing, though it did bump them up
another 1000 coins a piece. It's so bad! Then their train came,
they got on it, and round one was over. Hey! That's round one in the bag. That's round one
in the bag, baby. Never count the boys out. Never count the boys out.
It's so important— We saw you counting
the boys out earlier. We saw it,
and we've heard it. And we said, we're gonna teach
you not to do that anymore. And I hope you
learned your lesson, because we just secured round one. And here we are.
I feel so good. Nagaura. You ready to turn
back around and go to Tokyo? Yeah, that's gonna
be a bit of a journey. Let's inform Sam and Scotty that
they have lost the first round. Well, we may
not have won this round, but I think we're
setting ourselves up for a pretty good position
going into the next round. We definitely should not mention
what we've been doing to them. In particular, we don't want them
to know how many points we have. Adam says, ""Halt your challenges.
First round is complete."" Alright. GG, boys.
GG. We'll get you in the next one.
Yeah. Okay, so Ben and
Adam won round one, which gets them one point. But round two is bigger, better,
and crucially tougher to win. First, we've added a whole new,
much bigger region to each side. So now each team has to
capture and return both flags from both of their opponents'
regions in order to win. The round has a
16 hour time limit, so if neither team returns
both flags in that time, the win goes to whichever
team returned more flags, or if that number is the same, whichever team transported
flags a greater distance. Because Scotty and
I lost last round, we got to choose our side, and this time we're
taking the south, meaning we'll be trying to
steal this flag in Funabashi and this one in Sendai. While Ben and Adam need this one
in Kawasaki and this one in Nishio. In order to cover all that ground, coins are now much more valuable. A mile will only cost you
10 coins instead of 50. Also, to make it possible to
actually get out of the Tokyo area, Shinagawa Station and Ueno Station
are now both neutral zones. And if all that wasn't enough, we also have a new
powerup available: Towers. They cost 750 coins, and teams can drop them
wherever they want, both in their own and in
their opponents' territory. When opposing players
enter the tower's radius, they'll be subject to its effects. Oh, and one other thing: Because there are two flags, this round's worth two points. So if Scotty and I can win it, we'll pull ahead
in the overall game. So that's round two. And it starts now. Alright, gentlemen. Round two begins... now.
Good luck! Alright, let's go.
Okay, we have a plan. It's basically full-court press. We're both gonna go on offense, but we're gonna go
for different flags. I'm gonna go for the far flag.
Ben's gonna go for the close flag. And then I'm
gonna go on defense, because we think the only
way we're gonna catch them is on the rebound anyway, so I might as well
go for the near flag. What do you think we should do?
We have a lot of coins. We have a lot of coins. I think we should sprint
for the farthest flag. We're not gonna get caught
before we get to the flag. No, not before. The only question is,
can we get out? But we can split up. I think that's our move.
So you think up to Sendai? Just go, go, go, yeah.
Okay, let's do it. Okay, just so we're clear here, the teams have adopted
similar strategies, both going straight on offense,
but with a key distinction: Scotty and I are going
for the far flag together, which will save us coins
and prevent us from being slowed down by challenges, while Ben and Adam have
decided to split up, meaning they'll cover more
ground but move more slowly, having to stop for challenges. Adam's going for the far flag,
which is quite annoying to get to, and Ben's going for the near flag, then turning around to go
after us once he's returned it. Basically, it's a
bit of a speedrun. So let's see who can run faster. Okay, I gotta get
on a Shinkansen asap. Alright, good luck. Alright, I should only have to take
one train to get to their flag. That should be this one. Oh, it's gonna be a cozy train. Alright. I gotta get on a Shinkansen asap. I don't even know
when the next one is. Tōkaidō Shinkansen tracks. Okay. 6:30, track 18. 6:30, where's it going? Where's it going at 6:30? Where's it going at 6:30?
Where's it going at 6:30? Platform 20, there's
one in five minutes. Here, this way. Okay, so that took
forever to figure out, but I finally found the right one that stops locally,
leaves in 20 minutes, so... It looks like they're
both going on attack. So at least I'm gonna get
to the flag, no problem. We are going almost
170 miles per hour. This is ridonculous. And I think we're
gonna get in faster. Interestingly, Adam's
not left Tokyo Station, which if he took
the train after us, he would've by now. Interesting. So... It doesn't seem
like the right move, but often when they're
not doing the right move, that even makes me more concerned. 'Cause it's like, oh, they
thought of something we didn't. And it looks
like they are just... blasting right past the near flag. Which in my opinion,
is kind of stupid, 'cause Ben is gonna get
the near flag very easily. We're gonna bank a flag,
they won't have any, and then Ben can just go
on defense anyway, and... All he has to do is block
them on the way back, which... I don't know. Okay, so I've
made it to Kawasaki. Their flag's only about
a half mile from here, so I'm just gonna look at... to the best of my ability and... Let's just get this flag... scored, nice and scored. So it seems like what
they're probably doing is Ben is going to the closer flag, Adam's going through
the further flag. And I'm guessing that Ben is
gonna start to switch to defense. Yeah. Once he's done
getting that flag. Honestly, not a bad strategy, but it's gonna take Adam
at least five hours, probably closer to six,
to get that flag. Plus he'll have to do challenges. Yeah. So it's gonna
take him a while. Okay, so...
I'm on the bullet train. I'm realizing though that
it's gonna take a while to get to the flag... Just because it's sort of
in a weird location. Even though it's about the
same distance from the center. So, I'm gonna be pretty
significantly slowed down. So I just really am
gonna need Ben to be able to slow them down
when he goes on defense. You know, block off stations,
force them on regional lines, which I do think he's
gonna be able to do. I don't know. I don't know. Okay, I see
the vending machine. Okay... okay... This is it. Please. Okay. Flag... captured. Now I just gotta get back... across our side with it. That's my train back. So, it seems like Ben
has either gotten the Tokyo flag or is very, very close to it. He's at the right station, so I think it's a foregone conclusion. He will have the flag.
Yeah, for sure. And Adam's in Shin-Yokohama. Okay. So this might come down
to a drag race here. Yeah. So, Ben's audio cut out here, but here he is
returning the near flag. Yay for him. Welcome to Sendai. Lookit. Not what I had
planned, but it'll work. We're going that way.
It is chilly. Just wanna get outta
the people, huh? Just to explain
why we're running... Yeah. We want to try to
hopefully make it back for a train that's in 15 minutes. We have about
20 minutes of walking. Yeah. So walking
seems like not the move. One of us is training
for a marathon. Yeah. Yeah.
And it's not me. So Ben is still in
Ueno Station, seemingly. Yeah. So I think he might
just be waiting us out there, ready to respond. I'm surprised he had
that much budget. Ready, go. Okay, so now that I've
captured the near flag – let's go – the name of the game
is stop Sam and Scotty. So my plan is, I have enough
coins to buy two towers. So... we're just gonna
start pulling them. First tower is... What is it? Pizza Tower. Pizza Tower. Opponents may only move in
this area while holding pizza. Okay. This one, I think,
is pretty good. You can drop it
right on top of them, and if they don't
already have pizza, it's gonna force them to
stop whatever they're doing and go get pizza before they... can do anything else in the game. So this one I think
is pretty solid. Okay, what is it? Trap Tower. Trap Tower. If opponents are texted
""trap!"" in this area, they are frozen for 30 minutes. Opponents do not need to be
informed of this tower's placement, but if someone says they
placed a trap tower, it must be the truth. So they won't know
that this one is down, but if they go into its
pretty small radius... they get— we can freeze
them for 30 minutes. So this one I think
is also pretty good. It's a little— I think it might
be a little tricky to use, but... I think it's solid. If I can set myself
up in the right spot and drop these towers on them,
I should be able to tag them. So, let's go. How far are we, Scotty?
Close. Close, okay, that's good. Oh, that looks like
that might be it. I recognize that.
Yes. No IC cards. But it takes notes. People are stopping to help us. Just really— what is this? Third one.
Third one. What's that?
This is a brutal breeze. Let's go. So... this is their flag. What is this, by the way?
Do you know? I think it's tea. It's got like a stick in it. Oh, it's got a fish in it! See that?
Oh, it does. Is it like fish tea?
It was expensive. Yeah. Might be alcohol? Yeah, look. See that little fish? Are you gonna drink it?
No. Not yet.
Not yet. But I might. Celebratory, right?
Yeah. Tokyo Station. Nope, in Tokyo. Not in Canada! Right back the way we came. It's gonna be tight.
Yeep. Scotty, quickly, what are
your impressions of Sendai? It's cool. Feels like there's less oxygen. I think we've done it, Scotty. Hopefully! Platform 14. Still waiting there. Let's go. Oh my god. Okay, stop for a second. Nice (bleep) job. I cannot believe
we did that. That was 14 minutes. Okay.
That was awesome. That worked very well. And I am wiped. You want a sip of fish tea? This is a
picture of a flying fish. That's awesome. It might be soy sauce. It's an aggressive
amount of soy sauce. Soy sauce. Want some? Very fishy. Yeah, that's soy sauce. Well, we now basically need
to decide our path into Tokyo. Yeah. Alright, well, it seems like
they've gotten on a train to... I don't know where. I don't know what train they're on.
We can't tell what train they're on. But I'm pretty sure they
have to go through Ōmiya in order to get back, at least, if they want to get back in
any remotely quick place. So I'm going straight to Ōmiya now, and hopefully we can figure
out what they're doing. Best I can tell... Ben is on this train. But I don't really understand
why he would be on that train. Doesn't seem to make sense. Alright, I've made it to Ōmiya. And the deal is,
from what we can tell, basically if they
want to get to Tokyo, they've almost certainly
gotta go through here. Okay, now I
have it figured out. Okay, so Ben's probably
going to there, Ōmiya. Oyama.
No, Ōmiya. Oh. We are stopping at Ōmiya. Oyama?
No, Ōmiya. What? Let me see. I think we can be
pretty confident that— Oh, I see. That's where he is
trying to choke us off. Oh, he— No chance. They might think
they can give me the slip, but if I pop down the Pizza Tower and force them off their train... It's a pretty big station, but
I think I'd be able to get them. So... Yeah, I'm just gonna post up here. And sit menacingly and hopefully scare them or something. I don't know. Are they scared?
I hope they're scared. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus What the (bleep) are Towers? (laughs) Well, they can find out
next episode, which is up right now
on Nebula. Or they can find out in the
The Layover podcast. Which, what is that, Ben? So every week,
we hop on a call after the episode goes up. And we talk to Scotty, and we go over everything
that happened that week and all of the implications of all
of the strategy and the what-ifs. And this week, we're
really gonna be diving into everything to do with round two because now the map
is so much bigger. There are all of
these new mechanics. And we're gonna dig into
all of that in detail and really get into
the nitty-gritty. So if you're interested in
some of the behind the scenes and how the game is working... the Layover podcast is... That's what you want
to be listening to. Tens of thousands of
people listening each week. It's amazing. And you can listen to The Layover
exclusively on Nebula. Nebula, if you don't know, is the
creator-owned and creator-founded and creator-run streaming site that was built to be the best
home for creators' content. So not only do you get
one-week-early episodes of Jet Lag, not only do you get
the Layover podcast... Which by the way,
there's about 100,000 people who watch Jet Lag
one week early on Nebula. And there's Discord discussions
and Reddit discussions. And if you wanna be able to be
part of that whole community, subscribing to Nebula is a
really great way to do it. But it's not just Jet Lag. There's so much original
content on Nebula. There are full-length
documentary films. There are full-length actual films. There are stage plays. There are multiple original series. All by a lot of creators who
you probably already watch, who were just given
more money and more time to make their passion projects. And all of that is
stored on Nebula. Yeah, it turns out that
if you just take creators who are really good at operating
on a budget on YouTube, and making content that
people actually want to watch, and have earned an
audience through that, and just give them more budget... It's intuitive,
they just make better stuff. And that was a lot of
the idea behind Nebula, and also to create a more
sustainable ecosystem for these creators. There's a lot that goes into that,
with the business model. But one of the most crucial
aspects is the fact that when you sign up using
our link, nebula.tv/jetlag, we actually get a portion
of your subscription fee for life, for as long

Chibis by Twitchy Sparrow","8ZM_hPF1hsY","We're at Tokyo Station. We're gonna play a 96 hour game
of capture the flag across Japan. But it's 7 am,
so we gotta go, go, go! Oh, let's go, Scotty!
Oh my god. Okay, we have
to go make our plan, but we're gonna cut to the sequence
that explains the rules now. Okay, the goal of
this game is simple: Capture your opponent's flag and return it to your territory
without getting caught. The game will be
played in three rounds. The first in Tokyo,
the second across this region, and the third across
the whole country. Right now at the start of round one, both teams are at Tokyo Station. The area around here
is a neutral zone where players are safe, but the rest of Tokyo has
been split down the middle. This is me and my partner,
Scotty's territory, and this is our opponents,
Ben and Adam's territory. In each territory is a flag, which in this game is a
randomly selected item in a randomly selected
vending machine. In this round, the flag Scotty
and I are trying to capture is the third item in this
kimchi vending machine here, and the flag Ben and Adam
are trying to capture is the fifth item in this
juice vending machine here. But it won't be easy. All players have trackers on them. And if they get tagged by an
opponent while in enemy territory, they'll be sent back
to Tokyo Station to wait out a 30 minute jail period. So now it's up to
teams to figure out: How do they navigate Japan's
famously complicated rail network to get their opponent's
flag and get back, all while evading their opponents? So I think the first
thing we gotta do is just head into offensive territory. So we should figure out
basically maybe what the most efficient route
to the kimchi flag is. That sounds
like a good plan. What if they follow us though? Okay.
Okay. So we're here. So, okay. Whoa. We think that if we send one person
immediately to go defend our flag, and one person immediately
to go attack... That's probably the best solution. Hopefully they're going
to go together to attack. And then you are gonna go and start making progress
towards their flag. Yeah, and if you can buy me
enough time to get there and back, then we'll have this
round locked down. I don't think... that it's gonna be very easy
to catch anybody in Tokyo. Yeah. So I think from
a strategy perspective, we just book it. Yeah, I think you're right. So I think we wanna get
on the Ueno-Tokyo Line. Okay. 'Cause that takes us south
to Yokohama where our flag is. So I need to get
on the Ueno-Tokyo Line. There's one in six minutes,
and it's purple. So... Let's figure that out. Ueno... Taka— Takiwa. Okay. I can't seem to figure out
which direction to go. So I think we're just taking
this for about 10 minutes or so. Yep. I'm just gonna get on this
and see what happens. So what would we
wanna do if he follows us? We just
continue with the plan. Just bring on
a wild goose chase? Yeah. I'm not feeling too threatened
by the chasing right now. So time to figure out
if I went the right way. Went the wrong way. Went the wrong way, okay. Not great. It's confusing because
everything is in Japanese. Ohh. I don't know what any of this means. Platform three. Is this the right train? Yes. I think? No, I don't know. No, this isn't right. It's a different blue line? Okay, so after that train, I have 40 coins.
Okay. So I'm pretty much out. But of course we're gonna do a
challenge in Shinagawa, right. Yeah.
Okay. Even though we haven't
made it to the flag yet, we have to get off
our train now, because we're running
out of coins. You see, in order to
travel in enemy territory, we need to pay for
transportation using coins. It costs 50 coins
to go one mile, and all players started the
game with 250 coins each. If we want to earn more,
which we'll need to if we want to make it to
the enemy flag and back, we need to complete a
challenge pulled at random from this challenge deck. The trouble is, challenges can only
be done while in enemy territory. And if your opponents
tag you at any point, they'll steal all the
coins in your bank. Also, if we can't
complete the challenge, we'll have to veto it, which means we won't be
allowed to take any form of transportation for 30 minutes. The good news is,
Scotty and I are traveling together, which is a huge advantage. You see, if we do
a challenge together, we both earn the reward. But if we get on a train together, only one of us needs to pay for it, which means that by traveling
and doing challenges together, we can pretty much
move twice as fast. Okay, so I'm
gonna shuffle real quick. Pull a card and let's decide whether
or not to get back on this train. Play Sake Pong. Play Sake Pong. Fill a cup with a diameter of
four inches or fewer with sake. In five or fewer attempts, throw a ball into the cup
from a distance of six feet. You may place the cup
at any height. The ball may be makeshift. If you do not succeed, this
challenge is automatically vetoed. If you're attempting
this challenge as a team, you must alternate attempts. We'll need to buy stuff for that. Let's do that here.
I know where to go. Hey buddy,
I went the wrong way. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Oh, no. Oh no, I have to wait nine
minutes for the next train. (groans) (bleep) Well, I really hope that
it's taking Sam and Scotty a while to do their challenge. Alright, we're in it. This is exciting.
I know, this is good. By the way, who are you? I'm Scotty. I run a channel
called Strange Parts. It's nice to meet you, Scotty.
Yeah, it's good to hang out. Do you wanna be a team? I would love to be a team.
Okay, we want to go up. I just dunno if it's open. Does not look open. Oh man. We are too
early on a Sunday. Should we go
down onto the street? I don't love wandering
around this station endlessly. Okay, I need to
get on the Sōbu Line. I think I found the right line. Oh god! I found the train,
but it's too late, so I'm gonna take a different one. So I'm gonna check
on the green line. The Yamanote Line. I don't know what any of these are. Okay. I don't know what that means. Okay, I'm getting on the train.
Okay, I'm getting on the train. Alright, we're on our way. So, there's the beer. Okay, so
there's definitely beer. Hold on, I think I see sake. There's wine. Is this sake?
Yeah, here we go. Okay, sake.
We gotta find cups. That's what I'm more worried about. Yeah. Ah, here. There are coffee cups. Oh, perfect, so we're good. Okay. Adam is headed back
in our direction. Interesting.
And Ben is headed, looking towards the flag. I've made it to Kinshichō. Kinsit— —si—cho. I've spent 200 of my
250 starting balance... ...to get here. Which means I'm pretty
much out of coins, which means that it's
time to pull a challenge. And hopefully it'll
be one that can get me quite a bit further
into their territory, towards their flag.
So, let's do that now. A little shuffle,
little shuffle, little shuffle. And then we're gonna pull
our first card, which is... Stalk a bird. Stalk a bird. You must have a single bird
on camera continuously for five minutes. If you ever lose sight
of the bird or have to cut, you have to start over. The bird must be alive,
and may not be caged. Let's go find a bird. Let's go down to the street,
out of the view of the ticket booth. 'Cause I don't think
they're gonna love this. For good luck. Mmm, delightful. Alright. So do you think you— I'm not confident in my throw.
Do you wanna do this? I'm not particularly
confident either. I can try. You ready?
Yeah. Oh, that was close. It was really close. Oh, I see a bird. Okay, hold on. Okay, start the timer. Got the bird right there. Okay, don't go away, bird. Oh man, I do not love this. My hand-eye coordination
is not awesome. Maybe take the glasses off. Slow down and breathe. Do you think
underhand or overhand? I did it overhand,
but it's up to you. See?
(chuckles) Oh! So we got two more, right? Okay, that was three.
We got two more. I do not have a
great feeling about this. (sputters)
Okay. I don't like how
much energy this bird has. It's kind of hopping around.
I kind of want it to doze off. No, don't hop around. Don't do that. Okay, now it's up there. Now it's up there. Chill, chill. Okay, that bird took off,
but that was not the Ohhh! Mother–(bleep) No, no, okay. Oh, I can still see its tail. Oh, no.
No pressure. For all the money. Ready?
Go for it. Oh god. Okay, that sucks.
That sucks. Okay, so it's 7:49. 7:49 is when
our veto period starts. Okay. So, you know the other
thing that sucks? Yeah? There are no
trash cans in Tokyo. Yeah. And now we are cursed
with a cup full of sake. Drink it. Bottoms up. I don't wanna drink sake
at 7:00 in the morning, but you are welcome to. After that, I definitely
wanna drink sake at 7:00 in the morning.
(guffaws) Uggh. Well done. You wanna just give up? Do not move... bird. Just stay put for another minute. Please, bird. Please, I look so crazy. Ten seconds. Bird, just stay there. Oh no, stop moving around. Four seconds.
Come on, bird. Okay! We got a challenge complete. Ben is off for it. So I think, pretty much I think
we have to go on the defensive now. Yep.
Because— But we have 30 minutes
before we can do that. Yes, but I think
our tactic needs to be: we tag the runner, reset it back
to essentially where we started. Yep, I think
we have to do that. I don't think we have
another option. No, I don't think we do. So I've done the math. It's gonna take about 1,100 coins for me to get from
here to their flag. And I only have 800. So we're gonna have
to do a challenge before we get to
the flag regardless. So I'm gonna pull another
challenge right here. Give them a... It's hard to shuffle
cards with one hand. Okay, let's pull our next challenge. Become Totoro. Become Totoro. At a bus stop, stand
holding an open umbrella above your head and
smiling for five minutes. We are near a mall, so I
should be able to buy an umbrella? That man has an umbrella.
I can't steal his umbrella. Okay. In here there's a
couple little stores. Oh, I see umbrellas. Oh, let's (bleep) go. Oh, there we go. Okay, so we're going
on full defensive. Let's... where... Ben seems to have stopped. Yeah, so I imagine
he's doing a challenge. I would imagine that too. Hopefully he's suffering
as much as we are. It's nice to have a
little break this early. It is, I'm sweating bullets. (wheezes) Sam's getting
drunk in the meantime. It's not a challenge.
It's not a challenge. There's no rule
against it, though. That is true.
Bottoms up! This is a really scary
thing that I'm doing. Okay. That was five minutes. I don't understand
why Adam is just hanging out in Tokyo Station. Maybe he's waiting for us. Wait, that wouldn't make sense.
He must be waiting for a train. Oh no, he's not hanging.
He's coming for us. Oh. Should we go on foot? What if we just walk
north to the next stop? Man, that's sake is
actually kind of strong. (wheezes) Alright, go for a
little walkie walk? Let's do it. Let's go for a little
walkie walk, Scotty. Okay. Alright, we're going
the right way this time. Hello? Hey there.
Just a quick update. They've been at a train
station for quite a while. I'm wondering if maybe they
had to veto a challenge. And if it might be worth it
for me to stop there. I'm just wondering.
I'm gonna be at that station soon. You think maybe
you should go for them? I mean, maybe. But I guess, actually no. Never mind, never mind.
'Cause if they had vetoed, they wouldn't have any coins to
steal, so it's hardly worth it. Yeah, just take
this opportunity. Take this opportunity
just to get ahead of them. Okay, okay. Okay, sounds good. Good luck. He has continued
past that station. What? Do you think he's going to the flag?
Whoa, that's interesting. I do think
he's going to the flag. Interesting. I think he's probably
right about now regretting his decision to continue. Yeah, that does— I mean,
he doesn't know that we vetoed. He does not. But that's not the
right move in this situation. It is not the right move. Okay, so I think we
should be wandering back towards the station now. It's crazy how... it looks so Japanese. (wheezes) It does look very Japanese.
Yeah. Okay yeah, so we
want the Yokosuka Line. There's one at 8:27,
which is about eight minutes
after our period ends. Okay. Don't love that.
Veto period. Not amazing. Let me see
if there's another option. Okay. There is not another option. So I guess the only question is, will Ben escape from wherever he
is right now before we get there? Yep.
And we'll see! Un-blurry.
Get un-blurry. Get un-blurry. I need to get on this train. This train is gonna take me very close to their flag. Okay. Here we go. Ooh, Ben is moving. Oh, he is? Yeah, so I guess we
just wanna keep on this until pretty much the flag. Okay. It looks like Adam
is at the flag now. Wow. Good luck, dude. I mean... I think he's about to figure out
exactly what has happened. Okay, so I'm
now in Isezakichō... which is where their flag is. But seemingly that's
useless right now, because they are... They're not here. So... I don't know. Should I go back? Or should I just stay here
as a deterrent? No, they're moving forward. They're definitely back
in their territory. They're squarely on defense now. So... I don't really know
what to do with that. Okay. So, I'm almost to their flag. It's only ten minutes from here. But it looks like Scotty and Sam
are both coming after me. So I'm gonna call Adam and... have him find me some
kind of escape route. Because if they can
get into position before I can
get that flag, then... Oh, it won't be good for me. Hey, buddy. Hey, so it looks like Scotty
and Sam are coming after me. Yeah, yeah,
it does seem that way. So I'm ten minutes
from the flag. I can just run there.
I'm just gonna sprint there. Okay, great.
But I need to stake out— They're 50 minutes
from the flag. So, you have a solid margin. Okay. Okay, I need an escape route
and I need more coins. I'm gonna pull a
challenge right now. Okay. Okay, it's translate this card. Decode this card. You may use your phone to help
you decode this challenge, but you may not take
a photo of this card or use image translating tools. You may not ask others for help. Okay, I can't help you.
I can't— Yeah, 'cause I can't
take a photo of the card. Oh, we'll see what we can do. I'm gonna find you
an escape route, okay? Yeah, look for escape routes. Okay, okay. Alright, I'll call
you when I find one. Bye.
Bye. Okay, let's take a look here. Okay, so... Going out north feels like a risk.
They're coming from north. So even though there are
basically two ways out north, they're probably gonna
split up and take them. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, he can go south. Oh my god. Oh my god, he can go south. Alright, I'm on my way
to their flag. I'm pretty close. Wait, hold on.
Adam's calling me. Hello? Okay, I found you
something really good, so... Great. What you're
gonna wanna do is... Don't go back to Tokyo.
You can go south. Don't go back to Tokyo. You can go south
around Tokyo Bay and cross the midpoint
from the bottom. Does that make sense? Cross the midpoint
from the bottom. Yeah, that makes sense. I think I know what you mean.
Wait, through Chiba? Okay, I'm gonna
send you a screenshot. All you need is 750 coins. Okay, well that's
how much this one is. Okay, great.
Alright, alright. Gotta go, 'cause
I gotta use the map. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Well, I guess— (wheezes) I guess I'm gonna hang out here. I am starting to get worried, 'cause Ben is getting
pretty close to the flag. The flag's down here
in the corner. What are his options out of there? So, I mean, he has a few. Well, Sam, look at this.
What if he just continues on? What if he just
continues on down here? That's a problem.
But then he can never— Oh... So I wonder if we
send one person past him. Oh, that is bad. Yeah. I did not know about that. Yeah.
This little thing down here. That is a massive strategic
advantage for them. Yes. Yeah, so one of
us should keep going. Okay. He's definitely going
after the flag now. This is gonna be very close. Alright, four minutes to Chiba.
So we're both getting off, 'cause there's no way he can
get back in four minutes. Okay. Okay, I've made it to
the vending machine. I just need to get the fifth item, which is this. So it takes... 1,000 yen. Oh. Oh, okay. And now... Okay. I got the flag. Now, I just gotta get back to our
territory without getting caught. How am I gonna do that? Hey. Okay. Okay, Adam, I've got the flag. Okay. They are— I mean, they're pretty
much there, I think. Okay, they're—
Yeah, they're there. They're at Chiba Station, so... I mean... Is there any way out that's
not through Chiba Station? I could try to go through Chiba
Station and avoid them, but... So there's Chiba Station, but then there's Hon-Chiba Station. Hon... Chiba. And you can just go
from Hon-Chiba instead. There's a monorail
right on top of me. Okay, that could be good. Okay, I'm gonna
get on this monorail. And that takes me pretty close. So that's the
something-something monorail. Okay.
So if he does get on that... we should get as quickly
as possible within this station to that monorail. Does that go through here? It goes through here,
but see right there? Yep. Here we go. Yeah, I think that's
what he's doing. I do. Let's go find the monorail.
Yes. There, monorail exit. Central Gate. I think we should maybe split up. Okay. We're just gonna see
what we can do here. There's no perfect strategy. No, no perfect one. Okay. But hey, look,
we got the flag at least. Hey, that's good. Alright, I gotta go. I'm gonna get on this monorail. Alright, so the plan is, I'm gonna go on foot
to this other station where Ben could maybe slip out of. It looks like he might—
Oh, man. Oh, it looks like he's
getting on that monorail. Okay, let me call Scotty. Okay, here. Down, only up, that way. Alright, I think I'm
in the right spot. Hey, Sam.
Hey. Now his tracker's showing all the way to the
monorail station. Yep. Did you maybe want to
get on the monorail towards that way to go
to the other terminus? I was just gonna get on
the same monorail as him. Alright, oh, there's one
arriving on the other platform. My only worry is if he
takes that route the south. Maybe I need
to go to Hon-Chiba, to cut him off from the south. Okay, I'm
gonna try and book it. There's just one arriving
on the other side. Trying to make that one.
You can flank him on the south. I'll flank him on the north. So here's our plan: Right now, Scotty and I are
both pretty close to Ben. In this game,
we're using photo tags. All we need to do to tag him is
get a clear shot of him on camera. But there's a small
safe zone around the flag. Defenders can't walk into it, and attackers can't
do challenges in it. We are allowed to transit
through the safe zone, but we aren't allowed to get off our
train in the zone to go after Ben. So instead, we need to
cut off all his possible exits outside the safe zone. Scotty's gonna take the
monorail through the safe zone to Hon-Chiba,
blocking his way south, and I'm gonna go on foot here, protecting both stations
that can take him north: Chiba and Chibaminato. Theoretically that will trap him. That is, so long as Scotty
can get on the monorail to Hon-Chiba before Ben. I'm trying to make it. So you're taking it
towards Kenchō-mae, right? Yes. I gotta hang up.
Okay. I'll talk to you in a second. Okay. (breathing heavily) Okay, the monorail will
be here in three minutes. Okay, we're
close to him now. One more stop away. Oh, this is getting exciting. We have a chance here,
I feel like. Here we go. We'll see if
we see him on the platform. Hey, the monorail's
arriving right now. They've split up. Scotty is
coming after you, but... I don't know by what
means he is, but he's— Oh (bleep)! Okay, here it is. I think it's gonna be on this side. No, no, Ben, don't get on!
I think he's on the monorail! You think he's on the monorail? Scotty's on the monorail.
Scotty's on the monorail. Oh my god, okay.
I gotta get outta here. Get outta there,
get outta there! Scotty's on the monorail. Okay, (bleep) Ugh, okay. Okay, okay. Now I can't
actually get off, but... we can spot him. It's moving on. He was definitely
on the monorail! He's right here. I'm right on top of him. Is he here? Didn't see him.
He must be down below. Very interesting. Ben, you're good, you're good. Oh my god. Okay.
You're good, he kept going. He went past you.
He went past you. Okay, okay. Okay, we gotta figure
out a way out of here though, 'cause he's about to go
station himself at Hon-Chiba. So, the next stop is
the one I can get off at, at the end of the line, so... I think we'll then
try and pinch him? I don't know. This gonna be a little tricky. Well... now we play the waiting game. So Ben, it's down to you. Make your next move. We're ready. Since we're in a
bit of a stalemate here, I'm gonna just
complete my challenge, which I think I should be
able to do pretty quickly. So I found a website that
lets me draw Japanese symbols. And so hopefully I can
translate it this way. I'm not very good at drawing. And then there's a
little house down below. Oh god, I hope it knows
what I'm trying to do. Wither. No. We're just gonna move on. Uh-oh. This might mean tree or wood. Humanity? Might mean virtue. I'm just gonna try and
get all the simple ones, and see if I can piece it together. Oh (bleep). Ben is now out
of the neutral zone. But he's far enough
away from here and close enough
to the neutral zone that if I go after him right now, he could pop back in
pretty immediately. So, I don't think
that's the right move. I think I wanna maybe hang
out on this intersection to see what he does. So we're playing a bit of
a game of chicken right now. Scotty and Sam are posted up in
my two main escape routes. And to make matters worse... I'm pretty sure that the challenge
I pulled I can't actually do. So that's fun. So I have to veto it. I don't think that
they'll come for me. I think I'll be safe, but... I don't know what I'm
gonna do after that. I don't know
what Ben is doing. He might be doing a challenge. I think I'm gonna go
up to the next station. Put some pressure on him. Okay, man, he's only
two blocks away right now. But he's still so close
to the neutral zone. I feel like if I get any closer, he's just gonna
run back into it. Okay, there's a train arriving.
I'm gonna let Sam know. Hey. Hey, I'm going to Chibachuo, 'cause he is just hanging
out outside the station. I think that makes sense.
Apply more pressure. Okay, getting on the train now.
I'll call you when I go. Yeah, but I think I'm gonna
stay at the intersection I'm at, 'cause I don't want him to retreat
back into the neutral zone. And I think if I go
any closer, he's going to. Okay. I'll talk to you in a sec. Okay, he's still in the same spot. No movement. Oh (bleep) The (bleep) is it? There's a map error. Oh crap. Did I get on a— Oh no! I think I got on a Limited. Oh, this is a huge problem. This is a huge, huge problem. Okay, so here's the problem. Scotty thought he was getting
on a train that was gonna stop here at Chibachuo, where he'd be right on top of Ben. But this train doesn't
stop at Chibachuo. It goes all the way back to Chiba. That means the south escape
route is now wide open. If Ben realizes what happened and gets on a train at
Chibachuo before we catch him, he'd be able to slip right past us. Oh no, I got on a limited-stop. It didn't stop there, crap. I think Scotty might have
accidentally overshot Chibachuo. Alright, I'm gonna
pick up the pace. Apply pressure. I think Scotty might have
messed up a little bit. Yeah, 'cause he's back at Chiba. Alright, I don't want
Ben to get away. Wait, wait, Sam's moving. Oh (bleep), okay. Seemingly, he has decided
to end the game of chicken. He's going after Ben. I'm gonna call him. Come on, Ben.
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
Sam's after you. Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. According to this,
Ben hasn't moved. Which doesn't make sense. So, I'm just going fast
to see if I can... get him before he realizes. Okay. I just looked at the map. And Scotty's actually really,
really, really, really close. I think I... No, I don't see him. So I'm gonna get back
into the safe zone. No, actually... If I go back into the
safe zone, then I won't be counting down my veto period. And I need to do that. So we're gonna go... hide. We're gonna go hide. Hey, you went to Chiba? I made a serious error,
and I managed to get out. No worries, I figured it out. I'm going after Ben so he can't get back to
Chibachuo, given that. Oh (bleep) Parking garage. Just need to get somewhere... he wouldn't expect. He's over here. He's definitely over here. I can get him. He's somewhere over here. Benjamin Doyle! Ohh... good game. Ooh, that looks nice.
Here's your flag. (dial tone) Son of a (bleep) Scotty, I have a
message from someone. Hi, Scotty. Hey, how are you? I'm about to take
a sip of the flag. (chuckles exhaustedly) Oh, it's delightful. Hello. Welcome, welcome to our zone. Yes. Welcome to
our land in the north. Very hospitable. With Ben caught, he has
to head back to Tokyo Station to wait out his jail period, which also happens to be the
same direction we want to go, in order to get back
on the offensive and make another run at the flag. Bye, Ben.
Good luck, gents. You're gonna need it. Right. So we just passed Tokyo Station, and we're headed back
to Shinagawa, where we started this morning, to do essentially
the same thing again, hopefully with an easier challenge. Basically, what we're saying is everything that you've
watched so far is worthless! (laughs) Caption+ by JS*

that actually matters, make sure to come
back for episode two. Because in that, you get
to see who wins round one, and you can watch episode two
right now on Nebula. Nebula's also
home to The Layover, which is our aftershow podcast where we recap each
episode with Scotty. We talk through our
strategy in more depth. We go into the rules
in a little bit more depth, give you behind the scenes,
stuff that we cut. It's a fun time and it's
only available on Nebula! Comes out every week, and tens of thousands of
people are listening to it, 'cause it's so good.
Pretty cool. And Nebula's got, you know, a massive catalog
of other Originals from other creators that
you already know and love. It's actually one of my
most used streaming sites, and I don't even watch Jet Lag. I spent this whole— He's— You've never seen it.
No, I've never seen— I hear it's good.
Yeah. But I spent this
whole trip watching Modern Conflicts by RealLifeLore, who was our guest on season two. And I just had it
downloaded on my phone and watched it the whole time. It's, I mean, yeah,
it's a great deal, and... it's also a great
deal for the creators. Yeah, and what's
cool about it is there's actually a ton of people. Around 100,000 people
watch Jet Lag early on there every single week. So there's a huge
community of people discussing and
watching the episodes and doing fan art and memes
and stuff all one week early. So it's kind of the best
Jet Lag viewing experience, especially you know, given
the podcast and everything. Yeah, the cool thing
about Nebula is it was actually
co-founded by myself and a bunch of my creator friends. We got together and we basically
wanted to make a streaming site that was a better
experience for the audience and a better experience
for the creators. Like the best of both worlds. And part of what does
that is for the audience: it's ad-free, there's no
algorithms getting in the way, and there's all sorts of exclusive
content and early content. And then for the creator,
there's a lot of benefits. Like, for example, we actually get
a portion of the subscription fee of people who sign up
using our link forever. So that gives us stable,
recurring monthly revenue that we can reinvest into the show
and make it bigger and better. So if you wanna sign up, click the button

of our race across New Zealand! At the end of this episode, one of these two teams
will arrive here at Lookout Point in
Bluff, New Zealand and be declared the winner. But before we get there, our teams will have
a lot of distance to cover and challenges to complete. Last episode, Toby and I put ourselves
squarely in the lead, breezing through the
east route challenges, while Ben and Adam
got stuck in the west. But at the very last moment, Ben and Adam pulled the one curse
that would be able to save them, allowing them to redirect us onto a route straight
towards them, slowing us down massively, and setting us up to clear
their path to the finish line. Okay.
Here we go. Top one.
Top one. OH MY GOD! Yeeeees!
No— Wait, wait, wait. Tell them,
tell them, tell them! Holy (bleep)!
Holy (bleep)! Okay, okay, okay.
Call them. Call them. They haven't passed
yet, have they? Oh my god, oh my god. Okay, call 'em,
call 'em, call 'em. I'm calling,
I'm calling, I'm calling. It's not going through. You call 'em on your phone.
Call 'em on your phone. Okay, wait, wait.
Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I'm jittery. I'm jittery. (loud, shaky huffing) Stop. Okay. Is it ringing? No, I'm literally shaking. Okay, we need to go
to where there's service. Come on, get in the car. Oh my god, oh my god,
oh my god, oh my god. I'm gonna keep trying
to call them. Oh my god, oh my god,
oh my god, oh my god. I cannot believe
that that happened. That's gonna seem fake! We're gonna have a
lot of explaining to do. Ben, it's gonna seem fake! We're gonna have a
lot of explaining to do. Hello? Hello? Did you get through? Sam? Turn right, turn right.
You've been cursed. We get to choose your next route, and you have to go to
the Elephant Rocks route. Okay, understood. We just got a call from Adam telling us to urgently turn
right at the next road, and that he's sending us
to the Elephant Rocks, because we've been cursed. Yep. Yeah, one would assume that
we can go to the Elephant Rocks, come back on this
road we were doing, and then resume. I don't think so. I think we have to continue on. You mean go up there?
Yeah. But that would be a massive... change to our plan. Yeah, it would be. That means if we have
to go all the way up there, then we have to go through
Queenstown and everything. With this diversion,
we've gotta take the two and a half hour
drive over to Wānaka, where we'll converge with
Ben and Adam's route. From there,
we can continue south, but we'll be clearing some major
challenges that were in their way, giving them ample time
to catch up. Okay!
Yeah— (hyperventilates) (cackles) We were a little worried
that it wouldn't go through. But they got it. They got it. They have to take the turn. We literally
got that within— It was five or ten
minutes before the turn. I just... I'm so afraid that people
will think that it's staged. We did not stage that! We did not stage it. I mean... You could see a— You could see Ben shaking. I mean, if you don't— If—
And we also— We aren't that good at acting. Look at Ben's hands in the shot. Look at how he is (bleep) shaking! Oh... my... god. We're back in it, baby. We're back in it.
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I'm a bit upset to have
our plan thrown like this. We're gonna have
pretty mountains. It'll be fine. I was disappointed that we
wouldn't see the mountains. It might be fine. It'll be fine.
It might be fine. They are definitely
gonna get to Wānaka first. Not by a lot,
but just enough time that I think we're gonna catch up
to them in Queenstown. And then it's gonna be close. Alright. Back in crunch time. Let's... Let's be quick, but also
let's focus on accuracy. Yeah, I think these rocks. Remember the Elephant Rocks. Assign ten rocks different numbers. Then, using a randomizer, put those numbers
in a random order. One team member must
then memorize the order and touch the rocks
in the correct order, with the other team
member verifying. If the first team member
gets the order incorrect, you must pause for 15 minutes
and then try again. One. Two. Three, four, five, six. Seven for the tiny one. Eight, nine. Ten for the small one. Oh, we have zeros.
We didn't assign a zero. Oh, I guess that makes sense.
Why don't we just replace them all Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah.
from zero to nine? So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Seven, eight, and nine,
finishing, yeah. Ready? Yeah, gimme the string. Yeah, I can see the string.
I'm allowed to know the string. Yeah. So what I would recommend
is visualizing your path. 2-4-6-0-5... Adam, I have no idea
where we are right now. I know where we are. Where are we? We're in
The Snack Zone, baby! We're in The Snack Zone! Welcome to The Snack Zone.
It's a show within a show where we review New Zealand's
worst and best foods. And maybe their most iconic. We actually don't really know. Today we're gonna
be reviewing Weet-Bix. This very busted up
box of Weet-Bix that we've been traveling
with this entire time, but have not eaten from yet. Weet-Bix is
like Wheat Thins, but if they were thick. I mean it pretty much
tastes like nothing. You'll never guess
what's happening, Ben. What's happening? We're stuck behind
another slow camper van. Yaaay! It'd be really awesome
if you were a friend and let me pass. I would sing you a song! I would sing you a song
if you let me pass! (whispering) Five, two... (whispering) 5-2-4,
6-0-5, 0-3-4, 8. Five. Two. (softly) 524-605-0348. Four. Six. He's just chosen
to go down to... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, yes, yes! (in deep drawl)
♪ Thank you for bein' a friend ♪ ♪ A-travel down the

605-0348. 0348. Five. Oh. Three. Four. Eight. Nice job. Turns out that
was a running challenge, not a memorisation challenge. Yep. Okay, we are headed
through Franz Josef. And I think that we might be able
to see the Franz Josef Glacier if we look really closely. Okay, check them out. Check out the cool glaciers. May or may not be a glacier. They may or may not
be glaciers. We don't know. But there are glaciers
right around here. So that's cool. There's a big dam down here. Dam. Okay, so I've done
research for Queenstown. 'Cause the challenge
in Queenstown is about you've either gotta skydive,
bungee jump, or do one of the giant swings. So... here's the challenge. We're, I think, backed
into a bit of a corner. The problem is that as of now, including the stops for doing
#ThatWanakaTree... Wānaka Tree and Bra Fence.
Yeah, and Bra Fence. We should get into Queenstown
around 8:45 – 8:50 pm. So just before the rest period. And tomorrow morning... the earliest possible available of any of these is 9 am. The game starts at 8 am. So the earliest we could
bungee jump was 9 am. And that company,
they say to leave an hour and a half
for the actual jump, between the time it takes to,
you know, go through the safety stuff, strap up, jump,
go back up, and all that. So that means that
would effectively be two and a half hours
to do that challenge, which would give Ben and Adam
plenty of time to catch up and Nerf gun us. The alternative is that... we should have the budget going into Queenstown to skip it. That would force Ben
and Adam to do it. Yeah.
It would probably take them an hour and a half hopefully. Plus driving time and all that. Logistics time, et cetera. And I think that would build us
enough margin to do the challenge in Invercargill.
Yeah. And I'm not as
convinced as you are that that challenge is impossible. Yeah, I was thinking,
""Oh, we have to skip it."" It's catching a Nerf bullet
in your teeth. I thought,
""What, that's impossible."" But maybe? With enough time. We would be able to do
hundreds of attempts. But that makes me think that the best move is gonna be skipping Queenstown. In order to do that, we need to be sure
that we can get at least five upvotes on
#ThatWanakaTree. Create content at
That Wānaka Tree. You must spend 30 minutes
creating the most obnoxious tumblr-ified picture
of #ThatWanakaTree that you possibly can,
then post it on Reddit. It should include
at least one quote and ought to have gone
through multiple filters. You receive one coin
for every upvote you get in the first 10 minutes,
up to 20 coins. To add to our five points that
we'll get from the Bra Fence to get to 100 coins. 'Cause right now we're at 90. I think that this is our
best path to victory. It's much narrower than
I would want it to be. In fact, it is crazy narrow
for the fact that we were almost three hours
ahead on driving time. Sam was napping in the car
on the way to the skate park. Yeah, I was napping.
He was so comfortable. Because my
anxiety was so down. But it is... (click)
back up again. Mountains...! Love some good mountains. Okay, we are nearly
to our next challenge. Tell 'em what the
next challenge is, Ben. Identify 10 plants
at Knights Point Lookout. This region of New Zealand
is known for its diversity of plant life. Using iNaturalist or any
other plant-identifying app, successfully identify at least
10 different types of plants. Any successful identification
the app provides, regardless of how general, counts. One little hiccup... is that we don't have service and haven't had service
for about 10 minutes. So if we get there,
and there's no service, then the app won't work. And we'll have to veto it. Yeah, that would be bad. Augh. Alright, seven kilometers. Still no service. Not good.
Not good. Alright, we're getting
close to #ThatWanakaTree. Remember, our
30 minute timer starts when we get
in front of the tree. So we gotta make sure that we, you know, go once we get there and not waste any time. Every minute matters, right? Sorry, #EveryMinuteMatters. Alright.
Alright, alright, alright! We're back, service is back. We're five minutes away.
We have service. Thank god! Woo! Whew! Ohh!
Okay. That's good, that's good. That is really good. So even if there's
not service there, we can always just
drive backwards. Yeah.
After we take the pictures. Just a couple of minutes. Oh, Ben! Pretty. Welcome to
Knights Point Lookout. There is not a soul here. Let's go see the lookout quickly. There we go. #ThatWanakaTree. Isn't it worthy
of tumblr-ification? Point to the tree? That Wānaka tree. The one with the people. Are you still wondering
which one it is? I have no idea what
you're talking about. That one?
That Wānaka tree. The one sticking
out in the water? Yeah! The one with
all the people around it. That small, scrawny
little tree right there? Well, it's very pretty. Look at that. Very pretty. Alright, okay.
Let's start taking pictures. Down for the closeup? It's gotta be as
aesthetic as possible. Let's just get a lot. Debating. Good. Okay. Nice. Shoot these. Get these. Okay, I think that's good. The mountain's in the background. What do you think? I like it now. That's actually a
pretty nice photo. Colours are great. Time to ruin them
with some filters. That's probably enough. That's at least 20, right? To do these.
Okay, let's go. Let's hope for the best. Okay. We're just driving
backwards now until we can... find any service. It should be easy. I mean... Wait, what's that? Is that saying that there's
service in 700 meters? I think it's saying that
there's service in 700 meters. That's really weird.
Is there— Is that a thing? It's like, oh there's a spot. Yeah. Yeah, it just popped up.
Maybe? Oh, nice, nice.
Okay, start going. I'm gonna start
uploading them. Increase the
saturation by quite a lot. Sharpen all the way. Okay, well, I'm
gonna add some text then. Inspirational quote style? Inspirational quote style.
Here we go. Do you have an
inspirational quote? Yeah.
Okay. I have one. Well, I have one too. No, it just keeps saying... ""Can't identify."" Wait, really? No. Should we post that? Okay, I'm on
r/wendoverproductions. Is that where you wanted to go?
I think so. We're posting it anonymously to not spoil the season and as ethical influencers, right? It's there, it's there.
It's got two, it's got two. One of them is presumably mine, and I hope the second isn't yours. We just need three. Three more. Three more.
And then we're good. Okay, well that's one. Chain fern. Okay wait, so let me show. Okay, that's one. Chain fern. Sunflowers, daisies. Astrids and allies, okay. Can't identify. Can't identify. Grasses.
Grasses. Clovers.
Clovers, okay. Nope. Nope. Let's go back to the car. I'm just refreshing
the Reddit page. Looking for upvotes, but... Yep.
No more yet. Toby, what if you used your
anonymous Discord account to drop the link in the Discord? Oh, that's brilliant. Do it quick. (bleep) They're really
killing me here. These have gotta be... Okay, nice. Irises. Give me something new. That's a really
distinct picture. That's gotta work. Nice. Six. Seven. Eight. Yeah? Yeah, yeah.
Yeah? Nine?
That's a new one. Come on. Come on. Ten! Ten!
Ten. Yay!
Yes! Yes. Ohh. Oh my gosh, incredible.
Oh, whew. Okay, we barely
pulled that one off. Barely made that one work. I'm feeling pretty good.
Pretty good. Pretty, pretty good. Pretty good. Any response? Silence. What? I've never got less
engagement on a post before. Just say something like, they just posted from... I put the eyes
emoji and the link. It's time, we're free. So we've cleared the challenge,
but the question is, did we get the five upvotes
we'll need to skip Queenstown? We haven't done it. We only have three.
It went down from four. I said ask your
five closest friends. (scoffs) I didn't have time. Is it ten minutes? Yeah. It's been ten minutes. Damn. Wait, wait, wait, wait. We're gonna lose the game
because of two uplikes? Maybe? Say what? I don't know. Ohh, alright. We're continuing on now. That was really
nerve-wracking. That was scary. That was a little scarier
than I thought it would be. But we're moving on... to Haast. Complete a Haast Pass. With you and your teammates
both standing on dry land, throw a rugby ball
across the Haast River. Your teammate must
catch the ball. You may split this
into multiple passes, so long as you ultimately cross the entirety of one river width. It's a little pun for you.
It's a little pun. Hopefully that won't be too hard. It's a big river... but it has— it's split up a lot. And we can do it in multiple
throws if we need to. We just need to get the
ball across the river. Okay. Off to Haast. Yeah, Toby, I don't
see any way around it. I think we're gonna have to
bungee jump in the morning. It's the middle of the night in the places that most
of our audiences are. But there's heaps
of Kiwi fans of Jet Lag. No, I don't buy it.
They're not active. Not active on the Discord. It was barely any movement. We got three upvotes and
one downvote seemingly. (heavy sigh) So... Okay, so this is the Haast River. So already I'm seeing.... places where we could
probably do this. A hundred percent. So it has to go
dry land to dry land. Yep. So this is
probably too wide. I think that there's
definitely an opportunity right over there. You think? I can't really look right now. But if you feel
good about it here, then I say we do it here. I mean, I'm seeing lots of spots where it would
probably be possible. Okay, great. Alright. We're going down the
angler access path, but we have no angling to do. Not any angling at all. Is there any river? Yes, it's just
further up here. Sure is pretty though. It's very beautiful. All these rocks are nice. Comment below what
your favorite rock is. I feel like you
can do a little jog, or are you kind of beat? Well, I mostly think
I'm gonna twist my ankle if I do that.
Okay, fair enough, let's walk. It'll be really tight, whether
or not they can make it before we finish bungee jumping. I don't believe
we have 90, what, 98 coins or something? 98, yeah. I can't believe it.
We needed 100. Sucks. And you know— We would've
just won the game right there with 100 coins. The only person to
blame is the audience! This is, we've
got the bra fence. How many coins is... That's five.
That gives us the 98, right? Yeah.
Yeah. Find ten green bras
on the Cardrona Bra Fence. Any shade of green
or near green counts. Okay, so let's quickly, quickly,
quickly, quickly, quickly find 10 green bras. How far do you think
you can throw a rugby ball? I have no idea. Maybe we should test
that before we attempt. If we do lose the ball, we will have to veto
the challenge, 'cause— And we'll also
be in huge trouble, 'cause we'll have put a rugby ball into a beautiful river
in this lovely country. Okay. This is not a
hospitable landscape. No. This is taking a bit
longer than I thought. We're having to do a lot
more walking than expected. Okay, well, I can... ford this... river.
Okay. It's a very slimy river. Okay, that's cool. Alright, here we go. Part one of the Haast Pass. I'm on land. Ben is on land. Here we go, you ready? I'm ready. Oh! Oh god. Okay. One.
One. Two. I think that's—
Mm, what do you think? Is that green?
That's green, yeah. Yeah, that's green. Two.
That's actually green. Three.
Three. This is green. Four.
That's green, right? Yep. This is dark green. Five. Go ahead and toss it back. Okay. Well... we succeeded in doing
that, but wrong way. We did it backwards, yep. Okay, here we go.
You got it. Nope. Alright— Maybe you
should try and catch. Okay, okay, let's switch. Amazing. Alright, that's one
part of the river crossed. Let's go over there. This sucks without shoes. Still stuck without shoes. Six.
Did you get this one? Six. If you're going ahead of me,
I don't know which ones you got. Seven. Okay, here's an eight. That's definitely—
This is one. Nine, yeah. Here's a 10. Well, here's
an 11 back here too. Alright. 11 for bonus points. Alright, let's get in the car. Err so far on the side
of throwing it further. Alright, careful
in this river too. No. No, I don't feel good about that. Okay. We need to
walk further down. Okay. We'll get there.
Oh, mother-(bleep) Alright. Didn't end quite
as well as I hoped, but I still think we're alright as long as we can
get out of Queenstown ahead of Ben and Adam. Go extreme in Queenstown. In Queenstown, one team member
must do one of the following: go bungee jumping,
go sky diving, or do a giant swing. You're booking a bungee
jumping ticket for one, right? Just you?
For one. I mean, unless you want to join. I've never been bungee jumping. Sounds a little bit terrifying. I mean, I was ready to do it in
Singapore a couple seasons ago until the boys got to it first. But yeah, this one's bigger. And... it seems a little terrifying. And everything that Ben
and Adam ever said about it since then is like, ""It was way more terrifying
than we thought."" It's so— I— It's like walking across Legos. No. It's just those rapids. That's too risky. Okay. It's too risky barefoot. I don't know what else to do. What's the veto
period on this one? I don't know. Part of my worry is
that you won't be able to move to catch the ball,
'cause the rocks are... You won't be able
to pop over and catch it. Is there more
river over there or are we done after this? I think there's more. I think there is more. Maybe we should veto. It's not working here. Yeah. Okay, what do we do? I think we need to decide now. I mean, I think... If we can't even get past this Right, right.
part of the river... The part of the river
over there is even thicker. Right, and I don't think
it's gonna be a thing where... there's the same volume
of water at any point. Right, so it's
gonna be the same. So I think it's gonna
just be like this everywhere. And this looked easy to me, but it is way harder
than I thought. Yeah. Also, 'cause
it hurts so much. This sucks so bad.
The rocks? Okay, I think we
gotta veto right now. Okay, yeah,
let's just veto it. Oh Jesus. I know. How far could we
have thrown it? Let's see. I hit Dan. Well, I'm saying even that... Might have been in the river.
Would've gone in the water. You know what I mean? Yeah. 8:59. Rest period starts... right now. Okay, that was our spot. Alright. Good night!
G'night. My feet are so
(bleep)-ed up right now. I know, I know. The veto period
ends tomorrow morning, and then we can continue on to... Wānaka. I still think we
can catch up to them. They'll get delayed
in Queenstown. Our hope is just
that Queenstown is gonna take them long enough that
we'll have time to catch up. And then it'll be
neck and neck, and... we'll have a chance to win. That sucks though. That sucks.
That's very disappointing. Well, we'll see
you tomorrow morning. (blows kisses) Oh, 8 am, back at it.
Let's go. Hello and welcome
to the final day of this crazy adventure. Okie-dokie. It's 8 am. We are still here at the big dried up river. But not that dried up.
Not dried up enough. Not dried up enough. Okay, we can leave in,
I think it's 12 minutes. 12 minutes. They are about 25 minutes
out of Queenstown. And while we are stuck here,
which does suck, we can take some solace in
the fact that we are about to hit them with a curse
that they really don't want, which is that they are not
going to get any reward for their next challenge,
which is— They would be getting
40 coins from Queenstown. Yeah. I also think they're
gonna be relying— I think that they are saving
up to skip Invercargill. And based on our math, that means that they will not
be able to drop any roadblocks. Yep.
Which means that we can straight up just
follow behind them. And I think as long as Queenstown
takes them a little while, which I think it will... I'm pretty sure we can catch
up to them by Invercargill. Adam, I have
a question for you. Yeah. Did you also
discover a lot of shards of rock in
your foot last night? No.
I did. Oh, Ben. I have some advice for
those of you who are planning on crossing
the Haast River barefoot. Don't do it. Nope.
It's a bad idea. Oh, buddy, I'm so
sorry about your feet. No, I got all the rocks out. How are you feeling about
your imminent bungee jump? Honestly, not
even thinking about it. 3Not even thinking about it. I'm too focused on the game. I'm a little worried that
they're gonna have some, you know, some crafty power— some crafty curse they
can do to steal our coins or block us from
earning coins from this. So I'm actually a little bit now
in the mind of playing it safe and not roadblocking,
given that margin, and saving that budget
for later. You know, use this margin that
we have to go bungee jumping, then get that budget hopefully. And then after that we'll
be safe to, you know, use this. Let's not speculatively
spend budget. Yep, alright. There's some places
we can do it later. Check out these views. Oh yeah. Let's go. So officially,
I think Ben and Adam will now know that we are
not skipping Queenstown as they might suspect we could, and maybe would've if
Reddit was nicer to us. They're nearly to Queenstown. I think now is the
time to hit 'em. Now let's hit 'em. With this curse. This is... It's gonna hoit. Yeah, that's gonna
be brutal for them. Alright, I will let them know. Just got a text. It looks like it might
be a curse coming through. Ah, that's not a good one. You get no reward for
your next challenge. Well, I sure am
glad we didn't do the... Yeah.
It's fine, ultimately. It'll make things harder, but... the plan is still intact. The thing I really didn't want was the curse that they would get
our reward for the next challenge. Yeah.
So... that's not great, but I think the plan
is still intact. Alright, we made it
to the Bungy Centre. Ben and Adam, we're still fine.
We're back in control. We're so fine.
We're back in control. We will see. We'll see. We're still coming for you. We're not gonna stop. As long as they're
doing a challenge and we're driving,
we're catching up. So right now,
if they're in Queenstown, getting ready to
go bungee jumping, or you know, the giant swing... we are driving. Yep. So we are
gaining ground on them, 'cause we won't have to do that. Yep. Ohh. Alright, we're just
waiting around for the bungee jumping center to open. I'm gonna try to be first in, so hopefully I'm gonna
be the first one to jump. I don't love being
the first one to jump, being the guinea pig for the day,
but it's what's needed. So, hopefully this can
be relatively quick. Ah, it's fine. Are they on that bridge? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, it just, yeah. The Kawarau Bridge. Yeah. So Sam hopefully is
like, you know... He has to get on his harness. He has to get all set up. You know, there's hopefully
a lot of sort of like... administration
annoyance to deal with. Hope— Maybe he gets scared. He's gotta wait.
He's too scared. That would be great. Are you too scared? Well, we've been without
reception for quite a while now. So hopefully right now,
they're still in Queenstown having a spot of trouble. It's not her yet.
It's not her yet. 'Cause she's signing
up to the side. Okay. She's got that wait. Sam's really taking
one for the team here. I was scared just watching him. I was shaking. Sam, you did amazing! Thank you. That was something. What I liked is, 9:14. That was efficient. They're still... Oh wait. If they've left,
we're totally (bleep)-ed. They've left the Bungy Centre, which doesn't make me feel good. No. But maybe... No, I'd say that
makes me feel quite bad. Just gonna have to see. Not good, Ben. Not good. Not good, Ben. Were you shaking up there
on the bridge? No, not really. Again it's like, focus your
focus away from the scary thing. Yeah?
And it's fine. Focus just on victory,
and it shall be. Exactly, exactly. That's what I was thinking about. Okay, so now we need to get... Supplies.
Supplies, yes. With Queenstown out of the way, here's what the map looks like
on the way to the finish line. One route goes through
the Fruitlands. It's pretty long,
three hours and 19 minutes, but it only has one
simple challenge. The other route is only
two hours and 50 minutes, but the challenge,
where you have to devil an egg at the Devil's Staircase,
is a little riskier. For teams that need
a real Hail Mary, this route also has
a potential shortcut that can be unlocked by
completing a challenge in Lumsden. But if they fail it, then they're going
around the long way. I'm feeling more and
more optimistic, but... It's not over
till it's over again. Do you wanna
film in the shop? Yeah, just a little bit. Yeah, yeah.
Oh, do I want to? Yeah.
I mean, I can. I hate filming in the shop. Excuse me. Where do
you have your eggs? That's everything, right? Yep, mayo, mustard, eggs. It should be easy, right? Don't say that!
Don't say anything like that. That's okay.
I don't have to be optimistic. You're gonna jinx— No, it's jinxing it!
The cheese was easy. It's not jinxing it.
Yes it is! All we have to do is Don't, don't, don't, don't.
boil an egg. I think our best outcome is they clear deviled
eggs for us, right? Yeah. But then they'd
fail at the shortcut and have to go the long way,
and in that time, I think we could
make it to the shortcut. And if we complete
the shortcut, right? Yeah. Then I think... Then we could gain ground. Then we could
gain ground on them. Vieeeews! We'll have quite the
audience for our deviled eggs. There's the Devil's
Staircase down there. Fire! I gotta look for the spoon. Unfortunately we're gonna
have some cheesy eggs, 'cause our bowl is looking
a little less for wear from the cheese challenge. Just one or maybe— No, no, we want
at least a few in case we screw up peeling it. They're at the
Devil's Staircase, deviling an egg. (sigh) Okay. I could see that taking a while. Yeah, I mean, we're
about an hour behind them. Yeah, I don't think we'll
catch up to them there. I think a lot of this
is gonna come down to whether or not they manage
to get that shortcut. Yeah. If they don't manage
to get the shortcut, we could get the shortcut,
and that might be enough combined with the
deviled eggs to catch us up. Yep. I agree. Do you like deviled eggs? Hate deviled eggs. Hate deviled eggs.
Hate 'em. I can't say I've
had a deviled egg. You've never
had a deviled egg? No.
Huh. I mean, I'm not in
a lot of scenarios where deviled eggs
are offered to me. Fair enough, I guess. I'm gonna scroll Twitter. That'll reduce my anxiety, right? Well, that's better than
scrolling around on the tracker. Should we give it a look? Yeah, alright. Do you wanna fish
one out with... dare I say it,
this mustard spoon? Delicious. Wow, look at that.
I'm gonna show the camera. Look at this. Looks amazing.
Delicious. Take the yolk out. Look, I'm gonna mush up the
mustard, mayo, and egg yolk. There we go.
That is a devil's egg. Ah. There we go. How is it? Tastes alright, you know? It's not that bad. Alright, you know
what's gonna taste better? Victory.
So let's go. They have departed. (bleep) They've deviled an egg,
and they've departed. How far out are they? Looks like maybe... 10 minutes. Yep. They deviled
the egg pretty quick. Okay. We'll just see. Up ahead of us in
the road is an elbow. One final route selection. Yeah, we can decide
to do this challenge to unlock, you know,
where we have to run down a road with a macaroni. Carrying a macaroni
between our elbows. Yeah, but take time to get the macaroni
and then do the challenge. And if we fail it,
we only get one shot. It's extremely high risk. We have to double back
so it doesn't seem worth it. Basically we're gonna go
the slightly longer route, and it's a clear road all
the way down to Invercargill. Yeah, so that's
in the town of Lumsden, and apparently it used
to be called The Elbow. Yep. And that's how we create
our challenges. It looks like as soon
as they got to Lumsden, they just took the long way. Okay, so that means
that they're not even attempting the shortcut. No, it seems like they
didn't even attempt it. Which I would say is
overall good news for us, because it means if we
pull off that challenge, we will get enough
money for a curse, and we will save
about a half an hour. And those two things
combined might be enough. It's a really
good opportunity. Yeah, it's like... I would argue it's
our last opportunity. I would say that
if we fail this challenge, the game's over. I would say that
if we succeed at it, that we're still in play. Oh... dear.
So no pressure on us. I know it looks
really good for us, but in my mind it's still like
we could lose at any moment. It's come down this close.
I honestly don't know how, but Ben and Adam have had
plenty of time to think of how. So, hopefully we're right. Hopefully this is a clear path
all the way down to Bluff. I'm so nervous. Me too. Okay, here we go. Welcome to Lumsden. Transport a box
of elbow macaroni down Elbow Lane
with your elbows. Holding a box of elbow
macaroni between you and your partner's elbows, run down Elbow Lane
in under 30 seconds. If you do not make it in
time, or drop the box, the challenge has
failed and cannot be re-attempted by your team. We need to be so quick. Let's find
that elbow macaroni. Ben and Adam lost audio
while filming the elbow challenge, but I'll just let the
footage speak for itself. And with that final defeat, Ben and Adam were
decidedly out of the game. They're moving
through Lumsden, and it looks like they're
following the path that we took, which would seem to imply
they didn't pass macaroni. Oh no!
If they attempted it. They're headed out to the east? They're not heading straight down.
They're heading to the east. I don't know if, given
how long they were there, I don't know if they attempted it. But they're certainly moving
away on the longer path. Sorry, Ben and Adam. Currently still
50 minutes behind us. They must feel so sad. ♪ The driver doesn't worry ♪

in seven minutes, but I think we know what
we want to do, right? We know what we wanna do. We have the budget,
we have our plan. I think we're gonna skip it.
Yeah. Our plan is absolutely devilish, and I would like to
see the boys' reactions when they find out
we're skipping this one. Is it devilish? It is quite devilish 'cause
what if they have a lot of hope? What if they're driving
right now thinking, ""Oh, you know,
Toby and Sam are about to stop in Invercargill.
We'll catch them there."" I feel like they probably
expect us to skip out. That would require
them to have a detailed accounting of all our coins. That's true. Okay, Adam, I have some predictable but
extremely bad news. Lay it on me. They have blown straight
through Invercargill. Okay, so they have
skipped Invercargill. Yep, they just texted. I'm very grateful to have
done this with you, buddy. And I, you. It's been an incredible trip. It has been an incredible trip. We've seen and done
so many things. We have packed a months-long
New Zealand vacation into five very, very intense days.
Very intense days. Yep. Yeah. But we had fun. We had a great time. And you know, we'll say
it to 'em in person. Congratulations to Sam and Toby. They played great.
They earned this win. They played, I would say,
almost flawlessly. Very nearly. I mean, maybe one or
two hiccups, but... I mean, in terms of anything
that they had control over... I don't think they
made a single mistake. I would say they
didn't make a single mistake that I'm aware of. Yeah. They earned the win.
They earned the win. This is the end of the road. State Highway 1,
you've done us well. We have survived the journey. Look at that.
That's literally it. It's the sign.
That's the end of the highway. There's the sign,
and there's no one with a Nerf gun hiding under it. Oh, this is so exciting! Alright, this thing has
served us incredibly well. I'm surprised this hasn't
broken down 'cause it's so old. Not once, not once, but— Neither of us really knows
how to fix a car on the road. Yeah, but we gotta
finish it up on foot. Nearly there. Nearly there. It's just a couple
hundred feet further now. It's Lookout Point. We're nearly there.
Let's go! Charge the last few meters.
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! We've done it. Hopefully, no Nerf guns here. Oh! We've done it! Amazing!
High five! Season five. Oh my god. I can't believe we've
actually done it. Wow. Congratulations to you, Toby. You are now the world's only
undefeated Jet Lag champion. Number one. Number one. Congrats, Sam.
That was incredible. Your winning
streak has started. You were a fantastic partner. Couldn't have done it without you. Now let's just see when
Ben and Adam get here. We're on lookout on Lookout Point. Lookout Point. There they are. Sam... Toby...
Welcome. Congratulations on winning
Jet Lag season five. Thank you, Ben. Adam... You have something for them? I do. Got it here in my pocket. Oh, it's so cute this season. Wanna hold it together? We're kidding. We're kidding,
we're kidding here. Whoa-ho-ho! It's a big one. Look at that thing! Oh my god! To the ocean. We did it, Toby. Thank you! Amazing stuff. Toby, how are you feeling? Undefeated champ. You're an undefeated champ. And I'm feeling pretty tired. Yeah, I imagine
you might have been. Any particular expansion
you like to make on that? I might be... jet lagged. Ohhh!
(group shouting) Whooaaaa! See you in season six! See you in season six!
Bye! Adam, wave bye. Bye! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Man, New Zealand
was pretty great, but... I sure do miss riding on trains. Yeah, I'd love to do
another train season, but we already did Europe. Where else has a lot of trains? I don't know,
we'll figure it out. Was that good? Yeah, I think we got it. Okay, cool. We cannot wait to
bring you Jet Lag: Japan! We think it's gonna be an
absolutely incredible season. We're recording this in the past,
but when you're watching this, we'll have actually just
finished filming the season. And the wait is not
that long actually. That's because we put every
single episode of Jet Lag one week early on Nebula. Also on Nebula, you
can listen to our Nebula-exclusive podcast,
The Layover. It's our weekly recap podcast where we talk about the
latest episode of Jet Lag. And now that the
whole season is out, we can talk about
the whole season. So we're gonna have
a whole big recap talking about everything
that happened, and we're gonna be able to
talk about what happened after the season stopped filming. Which was that, I don't
know if you know this, but the day that Ben and I were
supposed to fly back to New York, Auckland had the biggest
flood in its history, and the airport flooded, and all the flights were
canceled for multiple days. Little bonus adventure, yeah.
It was bad. Adventure is one thing
you could call it. And so you can find out all
about that on The Layover. And if you need more Jet Lag
during the off season, you can watch our
Nebula-exclusive pilot season for Jet Lag
called Crime Spree, where we found the 33
weirdest laws in America, and we put them on a map. Sam had to go around the country
breaking them for a couple of days while Adam and I
chased him around. It's a lot of fun. We really had no idea
what we were doing. Yeah, we learned that season
that an important part of filming these
seasons is eating. And rest periods.
And sleeping! There were no
rest periods that season. Zero rest periods. So if you want to
see the most miserable moments of my life... Crime Spree. Go watch it. As you can tell,
the best Jet Lag viewing experience is on Nebula. And you know, there's
a reason why we make the best viewing experience
for Nebula subscribers. That's because this show,
since day one, has basically been entirely
funded by our Nebula subscribers. You might have noticed
we've never had another sponsor. Essentially every dollar of
revenue we've had on the show is from Nebula and from
our Nebula subscribers, which we appreciate immensely. And that's why we,
you know, do things like release the episodes
one week early. That's why we do
the Layover podcast. That's why we want to create this great experience for
our Nebula subscribers, and we would love for
you to become one. Especially because, you
know, when you sign up at nebula.tv/jetlag, our link, a portion of that subscription
fee goes to us forever, which we, you know, again,
reinvest in the show. And you know, that's
what's brought it from kind of this show that was season one, you know, just
in one corner of America all the way to the other side
of the world, New Zealand, which is obviously costlier. And we cannot wait for you
to see the next season. And you can become the
very first person to see it and, you know, get all
of that off-season stuff with the podcast and
everything and Crime Spree. Again, nebula.tv/jetlag. Sign up and we
really appreciate it. See you there. Bye!
Bye!"

to episode seven of our race across New Zealand. Last episode, my partner Toby
and I got a massive advantage by earning tickets on the
1 pm ferry to the South Island, forcing Ben and Adam
to take the 3:45 ferry. But our good luck didn't last. Our ferry left late and
took a long time to dock, and then we couldn't
complete our challenge and had to veto, all but eliminating
our once massive lead. We're hoping to widen the gap by taking the much
shorter eastern route, while Ben and Adam have
made the surprising decision to take the longer western route, banking on its challenges
being easier than ours. Things are— things have
improved dramatically. Things have
gotten a lot better. So here's the deal.
We're going on the west route. And the first challenge
on the west route is to get drunk on a local wine. Get drunk on local
wine at the Wairau River. The Wairau Valley is
one of the most famous wine regions in New Zealand. Buy any New Zealand-made wine and get one team member
legally intoxicated with it at the Wairau River. After we get one
team member drunk on wine... Obviously only one
person will get drunk, and it'll be Ben,
'cause I have to drive. 20 minutes later, we both have
to complete a Math Minute. Complete a Math Minute
in Saint Arnaud. Both team members – including the one who
just got drunk on wine – must successfully
complete a Math Minute within a minute
with no mistakes. If either team member
makes any mistakes or does not finish in time, both team members must try again. We're gonna do our very best. I should study my math.
(imitates percussion) In one kilometer, we're
gonna take a slight left turn to stop and drink our cake
in front of the pink lake. Drink cake at a pink lake. In front of Lake Grassmere, which often turns pink due to
its high salt concentration, consume at least one third
of a slice of cake using a straw. The cake may be in any form and may be mixed
with other things, so long as it is consumed. I'm excited actually
about seeing the pink lake. Yeah, although I just
got a view from the distance. It doesn't look
super pink right now. Oh.
Unfortunately. But I'm sure it is sometimes pink. A little bit of cream. Ooh. And stir. Oh yeah, see,
these are vineyards. This is a wine-growing region.
Yep. That's the point
of the challenge. I'm going to eat
the fermented that. You're gonna drink it. I'm gonna drink
the fermented that. Okay. Go to the median. Here we go. Alright. Any wine from New Zealand. Bay of Islands. Great. Thanks very much. Thank you. So they're currently
at Lake Grassmere. They're— the challenge is
drink cake at a pink lake, which... Sam is gonna hate that one. It just rhymes.
It's just— only— that— It doesn't teach you
anything about the lake or... It's just 'cause it rhymes. Alright, I think I've got
it to the right consistency. Nice and viscous. Okay. This must be
an American cuisine, 'cause it sure ain't
from around here. Oh yeah. This is... This is what I have for
breakfast every morning. This is harder than I thought. Every minute matters, Sam. What Toby's saying is true. Every minute counts. Even though the teams are on
opposite sides of the South Island, we're still in a
tightly contested race as we approach the finish. Ben and Adam went west,
a longer driving route, banking on the idea
that our challenges will take longer than theirs. So to help you keep track
of whether their plan is working, we're going to
periodically show you both teams' estimated driving time to Lookout Point,
our final destination, assuming both teams take
the shortest routes from their current points. Right now, we're an estimated 12 hours and 30 minutes
of driving time away, compared to Ben and Adam's
13 hours and 50 minutes. Basically, ignoring challenges, we've got an 80 minute lead. So, let's see if we can keep it. That's it. Alright, let's turn
around and send it! I'm not sure whether
I should turn around. Do you think I can— I think you can
just do it here, yeah. Alright, we're getting
very close to Kaikōura. And to sleep.
Looking forward to that. But we need to decide
whether or not we are skipping. So, we had basically decided, but then they went west. Do you still think it's worth it? I'm unfazed on
the skipping challenge, because I think it's just
our best bet to save time. We're gonna have so many
coins going this way. Yeah. The boys aren't
competing with us here. I think that
they're banking on us getting unlucky. They've gone that way
hoping this will slow us down, but this ain't slowing us down. So I think it's the
right move just to mitigate, just to minimize risk. So... should we do it? Send it. Alright, we are
skipping Kaikōura fishing. So glad to not have to
try to catch or I guess touch a fish again.
I'm relieved, yeah. My fishing experiences
on Jet Lag have not been
positive in the past. Sam has informed
us that he is skipping the fishing challenge,
which is... not a shocker. No. We had figured out
he was gonna do that. Unfortunately, the
reason we figured out he was gonna do that is that
it is very clearly the best move. Yeah. In response to us letting
Ben and Adam know that we were skipping Kaikōura, Ben said, ""Yes, we figured lol."" What does that mean? What do they know that we don't
about the western route? I thought they would
actually be kind of surprised. Yeah, I thought that they
were banking on us getting really slowed down, but... If they're not banking on this,
then what are they banking on? Ben and Adam's mics cut
out for a few minutes here, but because we skipped Kaikōura, it meant we were on one of the
longest empty stretches in the game, giving them the
perfect opportunity to use their useless,
but annoying curse. You must listen to Tom Lehrer's
""The Elements"" song on repeat until you reach
your next challenge. Toby, we have received
some somewhat fortunate, somewhat unfortunate news. We have to listen to the
Elements song by Tom Lehrer until our next challenge. And because we've
blown past Kaikōura, that means we have to
listen to this song all the way until Christchurch.
No... no... This might impact our sanity, but this should not impact our... ...progression.
Sure. So it's a good thing
for our gameplay. It's a bad thing for
our sanity basically. ♪ ...Arsenic,

A bunch of bugs up here. We're at the Totalspan.
Show them the Totalspan. Bye!
Bye, Cyberdog! So now we're about 10 minutes
from the Wairau River crossing. Oh my god, a bug flew into my eye. Okay. And then we're gonna
play a fun game called How fast can Ben drink half a
bottle of Chardonnay at 8 am? Yep. It's one of my favorite games. Oh my god,
the bug is in my eye. So, this bottle has four—
or eight standard drinks. I need to drink four,
so I have to drink half of it. Yep. Today on a very special
episode of The Snack Zone... Ben will be drinking
half a bottle of wine at eight in the morning. How's it going? I just don't

you getting notes of? Yeah, like... Yeah, like grapes and

you need a second. Keep drinking it. Got a burp in me. Mm-kay. No? Okay. I am starting to get drunk. Bwuh. That's half. Great job. Okay, now, as quickly
as humanly possible... we have to get to St. Arnaud because now we both have
to complete a Math Minute. And we need to try to start it

realized that Ben and Adam have a small chance
of being able to do? Yeah? They're earning coins again, which means they can
pull curses again. And there's one curse that allows
them to choose our next route. No, is there? Yeah. So there's probably one long-shot
chance of them catching up. And that's them pulling that curse and forcing us to take
a really bad route. For example, the one
west out of Christchurch. So let's not dilly-dally
in Christchurch. Getting out of Christchurch
quickly won't be easy, because the next challenge is: Show a plant the Garden City. Christchurch is nicknamed
the Garden City. Legally and ethically
obtain a live plant and bring it to four of
the following locations, spending 10 minutes there
and taking a photo at each one. Alright, Adam. Our next challenge is in what, one hour, 48 minutes? Yep, hour 48. We're going to
Constant and Joyce Bays. Yep. Skip a stone six times
at Constant and Joyce Bays. Get a stone to skip at least
six times on the surface of the Constant and Joyce Bays. And the reason that
that's the challenge is that there's just a lot of beautiful, smooth stones there. Love that. And neither of us are
very good at skipping stones, so we're gonna watch
an instructional video about how to do it.
We did. We downloaded a video
about how to skip stones. Yeah, we're really gonna

started the challenge. And that means we are freed
from the Elements song. Very exciting. Alright, we need to
find a small plant. One that we can sneak
into different museums. Just a little cactus. They're quite cute, look. Oh yeah, let's
just get one of these. Yeah, yeah. Should do that?
Yeah, he's cute. Alright.
He's cute. We've been seeing
lots of vague political signs along the road. Yeah, we just
saw a sign that said ""The clowns are
running the circus."" As they should be. Yeah, I mean,
that's good, right? I mean, that's called an
employee-owned company. Yep, a worker cooperative. That's a worker cooperative. I think that's wonderful news. Oh, beautiful. Alright, let's see if we
can find parking down here. Let's do it and
let's do it quickly. Yeah, these rocks
are all very good. Okay, here we go. The Intern— or the Antarctic—
whatever it's called. International Antarctic Center, should just be three
minutes that way. Stash this guy in here
until we get inside to take a photo with him. Alright, so our time starts the second that we
enter the building. So let's just get in
as soon as possible and then we'll buy tickets.
You got the plant? Yep. Got him in here.
Have you spoken to him? Have you introduced yourself?
Not yet. No, I'll introduce
myself in there. 20 degree angle
of the throw. Spin it as much as possible. Alright, ready?
Yeah. Nope. That was three, so better. No. Let's— I'm gonna
get more rocks. The challenges— Did you wanna try and catch
the end of the penguin feeding? Oh yeah, we should
get the penguin feeding. And a small one page. No. Damn it. That was three. (bleep) Two. Four. That was definitely six. That was like seven or eight. That was definitely six. Alright, alright, nice! Alright, I feel like
that went really well. That was not bad at all. No, I mean,
we were in and out in about ten minutes,
I think. Challenge complete. Now our next challenge is at the Motukiekie Beach Walk. Find a starfish on the
Motukiekie Beach Walk. Find a real starfish,
living or dead. It cannot be a
depiction of a starfish. If able, you must
go onto the beach. I would love
to see a starfish. It is apparently very
difficult to access the beach during high tide. And I do think it's going to
be high tide when we're there. We found a blog that said that there's like a secret entrance
that you can take. So we're gonna look into that. Brrrr... You've gotta find what
those subtle indicators are that you can look at and know— Selfie. Thank you for visiting Antarctica in ten minutes. Alright, Botanic Gardens. It's a whole 16 minutes. That kind of sucks. Alright, so it looks like
Ben and Adam have already left the rock skipping challenge. I was expecting that to be
harder, but I guess not. Pressure's on. Do you think there are
any stingrays in there? Alright, parking
took way too long. There was not a single
spot in that lot. We had to get a little creative. But we think it's fine,
'cause it's only for ten minutes. Alright, welcome to the gardens. Alright, 11:13, ten minutes. Seems like a memorial. We're sneaking.
Okay. One day, you'll
grow to be this big. Alright, plant selfie. Okay, it's 11:23. Let's go. Oh, it's gonna take forever
to get out of the parking lot. Good news. They are still
in Christchurch. Okay, that's really good. It's exactly what we want. I mean, longer is better, but... I mean, we, I will say... are breezing through
these challenges about as quick as we
had been hoping to. I'm hoping if we can find
a starfish quickly... I mean, we're gaining, I would say we are
gaining on them. We're definitely
gaining on them. Alright, coming up on the: ...I think. Alright, let's go. Can we have two adult tickets? Two adults? Yeah.
No worries. Yeah. Hi. Look at Hogwarts. Yeah, I used to have this. Planes! Oh, that's a
lot of Hot Wheels. Oh, look, it's the Pez Museum. Ben, Adam. Yeah. Oh we gotta go, our time's up. This museum's too good. I know, I know, I know. I wish we could stay. It was such a good museum.
It was such a good museum. Air Force Museum of New Zealand. Oh, another 15 minutes.
Geez, these routes. I mean, this is the
quickest route, I did look. I didn't expect
Christchurch to be this big. Oh, are they
still in Christchurch? Let's check where they are. I really hope that they are. That would be really awesome. Seemingly they are,
have not left Christchurch. Really? Yeah. I mean they might, you know,
they could leave any minute. But as of— That's current? As of right now,
they are still in Christchurch. I mean, that's awesome. That means they've been
there for a really long time. I mean, things are going pretty
good for us so far today, Ben. Yeah. I don't wanna
get ahead of myself. But things are going
pretty good right now. I'm pretty pleased. If we can find this starfish...
If we can find a starfish... That's the last big thing
on this route that I'm worried. That's like, I'm worried
it's gonna be impossible. If it wasn't for
that damn curse card that they could pull
at any moment that would force us
on a terrible route, I'd just be chillin'. Yeah, I would just be
J Chillin, you know. Curse Ben and Adam. Well, specifically, well,
we could curse Ben and Adam, but metaphorically
curse Ben and Adam. We're at 30 coins now, which means we could buy
a curse if we wanted. I'm intrigued by the
idea of buying a curse, but I want to have
the potential to do a challenge skip late in the game. I don't think we
need a curse right now, so I think we should
just hold onto our coins. Yeah. Free entry. Nice. I love a big plane. (whispering) There's more planes. Plane with skis. What could be better? We've done it, Toby.
Okay, we're in, we're in. We're safe for now. Safe for now.
We're safe for now. Ben and Adam are crafty. If there's any potential
that they could win, they're gonna identify it. They know what's up, yeah.
Yeah, they know what's up. (rapping)
Let's go to the beach. Beach, let's go get away. They say what they gonna say. Have a drink, clink,
found a Bud Light. Bad (bleep) like me
is hard to come by. Ninki Minaj, Ninki Minjaj. What's that— it's a Vine. I don't know. Ninki Minjaj. Adam? Yeah?
Welcome to the beach. Thanks buddy. There's even cows at the beach! There's cows everywhere
in this dang country, buddy. Cows deserve
to be at the beach. Every cow deserves a
little trip to the beach. That's true. Every cow does
deserve a little beach trip. I'm sure they—
Every cow deserves to take a little trip to the beach. Do you think they like it? Yeah, I think they do. Good. I think they love it. Look at that. We really, really need
to find a starfish fast. Is this the random pull off that they were talking about?
Maybe. It could be. That turnoff looks kind
of promising right there though. Okay. What is this?
Okay, let's try this. What is this? No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Definitely not. I think we need to turn around
and try that other one. Okay. Think just over here. And there is a—
That's a little path. There's a secret little path.
Look, look! Okay, we're gonna try that.
That's a little path. This has gotta be it. Wait, wait, Ben, slow down a sec. Okay, so our
next challenge is... couldn't tell you where. Somewhere south of here. Isn't it Timaru? Maybe. Ride your snowboard at
Timaru Skateboard Park. Modify your snowboard to
have at least four wheels, which may be obtained anywhere. Ride the snowboard down an incline
at the Timaru Skateboard Park. You do not need to stay on
the snowboard the whole way, but the modified board
must remain intact. We gotta convert this bad boy, our snowboard, into a skateboard. We're carrying
this annoying thing around in the back seat.
Yeah. We're glad to get rid of it. So there's a massive
hardware store here. So we're gonna stop there, and hopefully they
have some wheels that we can attach to it, and hopefully should
be pretty easy. This sounds like a bit of a
cursed challenge in a way. Alright. We're looking for wheels
to screw onto something. Do you know where that might be? Like small little
skateboard type wheels. Oh yeah, come
with me, guys, yeah. This is for sure it. Nice, nice!
We found it, okay. Just be careful. Okay. Careful, careful. Hug the side. Great job. There's a rope. Seeing anything? No. I'm not seeing anything. Shoot. I think we might
have to veto this one. Shoot! Oh yeah, that's perfect.
Thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, no worries. Alright. What do you think? I think these guys would be good. Yeah.
It won't take that big a screw. Yeah, these
little ones look good. Little rubber ones. Then we need to
find screws and... A screwdriver. Yeah, screwdriver for sure. I'm gonna look
around the corner! Okay. So the problem is...
it's high tide. At low tide,
I think there would be starfish washed up on the shore. Gonna go down there though,
and check on it. Gonna run while the wave forms. Whoa. Ha-ha! Yeah. No, this is a lost cause. Okay. Alright, we're gonna
have to veto for sure. Uh-oh! Ack! (bleep) (cackles weakly) Hi. Alright. Thank you. Thank you. No starfish? No, veto for sure. Okay, let's veto. Okay, veto. Veto clock starts now, one hour. This sucks. But it's so pretty,
it's kinda hard to be mad. Alright. Alright.
Well, that... was quite bad. So at 1:26, we can
continue on to Hokitika. Where the challenge is... Make your own
Hokitika Beach sign. Hokitika Beach is known
for its driftwood sign. Anywhere else on the beach,
construct your own upright sign – out of any forged wood –
reading Hokitika. It must be at least one foot tall. After this is over, I mean,
this could be a good place to get some sticks and stuff. Yeah, maybe. But obviously we can't do that until the veto period is done.
No. Okay, it is... 15 seconds until the
veto period ends. I think... in five seconds, we are going to start
forging sticks for Hokitika. 'Cause there are some
sticks right over here. And let's go. Alright.
Alright. So theoretically we need
18 sticks to spell 'Hokitika.' We are trying to be
very good boys. We will only be picking up sticks that are dead,
that are already on the ground. We will not be disturbing
anything living. That's probably a foot. Some shorter ones for the
connective parts as well. Okay, I feel like this
is probably enough. Let's put these sticks in Dan,
and let's go to Hokitika. I just need to make sure
these don't fly outta the car. I think I'm officially
all outta bits. So I can't think of anything more interesting to
do while driving. There are trains at least. Do you have anything interesting? Not off the top of my head. Is this Hokitika? Maybe this is Hokitika. Welcome to... Hokitika. Now, we may or
may not need tape. I think we should get it. But I think
we should be safe, and we might need tape later, so it's not a huge
amount of wasted time. Okay. That looks good.
Yeah. Hi, just this. Alright, let's go. Alright,
here's the actual sign. We're gonna go out
onto the beach... make our own. Come on, buddy. To make the O... There we go.
It's standing up on its own. Hokitika. Let's go!
Okay. Goodbye, real sign! Well, we need to buy an
egg for the next challenge. Egg drop at the
landing site of Guy Menzies. Visit the landing site
of Guy Menzies, the first person to cross
the Tasman Sea by airplane. While there, create
a vessel for your egg and throw it at least
10 feet in the air. It cannot crack once
it hits the ground. You may bring material to
the site of the challenge, but you must construct your
vessel at the landing site. Yeah, New World. Okay, thanks. Are they out of eggs? Aren't eggs not refrigerated
in other countries? Oh. Eggs. Let's get fewer.
Nice, okay. That's what happened. They don't refrigerate them
in other countries, Ben. That's why we couldn't find them. Transaction accepted.
Let's go. First of all,
we got the eggs in Hokitika. We also got some cotton balls. We have cups in the back and tape. So we kind of figure that we can
kind of just cushion an egg with cotton balls and
put it between some cups and... that should do the trick. Yes. So we will see you at the
landing site of Guy Menzies. So as you can see on the map, this is the moment when
Ben and Adam learned that we were going on the east route
down to Invercargill, and not taking the west route that would converge
with them earlier. Toby and I didn't say
much about it on camera, because it was
obviously the best move, but it wasn't particularly
good news for Ben and Adam, because, well, it was
obviously the best move. This means that
there's no possibility we'll clear challenges for them
until the very end of the game, which means there are
very few ways to catch up. Their only realistic
path forward now is to go high risk, high reward,
pull as many curses as possible, hoping to get the one they
need to even out the game. So, they have gone east. It means that there's
no possibility that they'll be able to clear
any challenges for us... until Invercargill, which is
the second to last one. So I think that... we should be buying curses. That we can afford one first. But after the egg drop,
we'll be able to afford another. So, we're gonna just
start pulling curses, starting with... with one now.
Yeah. We really need it to be good. So, okay. I'm gonna pull it. You get no reward for
your next challenge. Okay, that's pretty good. Yeah. I mean,
we'll just hang on to this and use it at the
best possible time. Welcome to Timaru. Home of the Timaru Skate Park slash snowboard
used as sandboard modified into skateboard park. Oh my god, there are a
bunch of scooter kids. This is terrifying. You've got some
competition, Sam. Alright, this concrete
is very hard. (chuckles) Oh... Okay, it didn't say
I had to stand up. Alright, you ready?
You wanna go down there? Oh, that's your ramp? Yeah. I was waiting for
you to walk over there. I'm not going
down that on this! I'm not breaking myself. Okay, well it works. Hang on, are you sure
we can't find another one? I'm not going
down that on this! In the middle? That? I don't wanna get
in all their way. You sure, it's just... Okay, let's try this one. Do you think he
can skate down that board on that little square down there? On that?
Yeah. It might be quite
hard, but probably. Yeah, well,
I told him he can do it. Hey. This is steep! Okay. I think I'll pass that. Wait, is that a
snowboard with wheels? Yeah. It's, I made it
into a skateboard. Oh nice. It's a DIY skateboard.
Yeah, it works out well. I recommend it if
you ever want to try... you know, upgrade from that. Oh yeah. I do have
a skateboard at my house. Oh, yeah? Well, these
guys are even bigger, so you know, better. Alright.
Alright. See ya. I'm gonna reckon a guess
and say that we're in the middle of a
montage sequence right now. It could be true. All of the rivers
seem to be really dry. I don't know if that's normal
or a really bad thing. I have no idea. Let us know if that's normal
or a really bad thing. Alright, next stop, penguins! We've already seen penguins today.
We have. We're gonna
see more penguins. Hopefully. (stammers) I'm optimistic. Okay, here's the deal.
We're about eight minutes out from the landing
site of Guy Menzies, where we can do our challenge. They are also about 15 minutes from the next point where
they could take a turn. Now, obviously they really don't
want to take a turn up west, and they won't. But there is a curse where we could force
them to do that, and we'll be able
to buy another curse after we do this thing. So what we need to do is do this egg drop
in one minute. Buy a curse. And if it's the one that
allows us to force a turn... Then...
They're (bleep)-ed. They would
be totally screwed. Yeah. Alright. We can learn all
about Guy Menzies. Alright, we gotta hurry,
hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Car. Where are the cotton balls? They're right
there in my seat. Okay, okay.
Let's hurry, hurry, hurry. Guy Menz—
Yeah, Guy Menz-egg. Okay. Here we go. Okay. Okay, ready? One, two, three. I mean, that felt like nothing. If he survived,
then we can buy a curse. Okay, okay. He survived, let's
buy a curse right now. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Okay. Okay, okay.
Here, I got it, I got it. Okay, hold on. Okay, here we go.
Top one. Top one. (gasp) OH MY GOD! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus We're back in it, baby. We're back in it.
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! It's come down this close.
I honestly don't know how. but Ben and Adam have had
plenty of time to think of how. We need to be so quick. I'm gonna scroll Twitter. That'll reduce my anxiety, right? Well, that's better than
scrolling around on the tracker. We barely pulled that one out. Barely made that one work. Our plan is
absolutely devilish. We will see. We'll see. We're still coming for you. We're not gonna stop. The Jet Lag season five
finale is available right now on Nebula. It's epic, it's amazing. And you know, it's actually
not what I expected. Toby and I were very chill
at the end of day four, because we thought we
had this so in the bag, I actually took a nap
in the car on that day. While Toby was driving. While Toby was
driving, to be clear. I remember there was one line
that I said that was like, ""Don't worry too
much about filming. I'm pretty sure we're just
in a montage sequence."" 'Cause I thought that
there was gonna be so little drama at that point that we'd probably just be
montaging until the finish line. Clearly it didn't end up that way, 'cause of that little
curse thrown our way. But you can find out exactly
how this all came to an end right now on Nebula. And there's even more that
makes Nebula worth it. Like for example? Our Nebula exclusive
companion podcast, The Layover, where every week we get together,
we break down each episode, and we answer your questions
about what went down. And... Nebula has all
kinds of other things. Exclusives from other creators. A lot of creators put
their videos up early. It has our podcast and the
one week early episodes. We've probably mentioned that. But most importantly, the thing to know at this point
is it has the finale right now. You can watch it right now. And you can help support us, because, you know,
Nebula is owned by creators, and it is run to be a sustainable
place for independent creators. So that means that when you sign
up at our link, nebula.tv/jetlag, that subscription fee, a portion
of it goes directly to us. Which, you know, helps us
do things like next season. Making it bigger and better and
grander and faster and all that. So yeah, basically make sure

with a Nerf gun, which will freeze us
for 30 minutes, which would cause both
teams to miss the ferry, putting everyone on the 3:45 ferry
and tying up the game. The Wellington challenge,
by the way, is to run for Prime Minister
by creating a campaign video, making promises at
four of the following nine notable Wellington locations. Already not easy,
but especially difficult because Ben and Adam
hit us with a curse that means that if
we use the letter E anytime in the next three hours, we have to freeze in place
for five minutes. Plan words? Plan... words. Good. Words...
Mmph. Okay, so looking at
all of the locations Yeah.
That they might possibly go to... There are two that are
right next to each other: the Wellington Museum
and the Waterfront Walkway. They would have to be
crazy not to go there. Right. That's a really good idea.
Okay. Make that our destination. I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous too. Park. They're in Wellington.
They're at the Beehive right now. They're already there? But presumably
they're at the Beehive, and they're trying
to find a tie nearby. But it's okay. I mean,
we're only 14 minutes... I guess we didn't specify
you had to buy a tie. They might have just found
something they can use as a tie. It's true. Kia ora! I'm Toby,
running for top job. If I win that job, I'll construct many
good buildings... that you'll say wow about. Okay. Okay. I think they're
back on the road. Really?
Yeah. Shoot, that was fast.
That was fast. Okay. I think put
on your disguise. Park, walking all. Fast. Faaast. I'll look at our old stuff and put it on display for all to look at
and think about. Looks like they
might be going out to the Waterfront Walkway now. Seven minutes.
Seven minutes, Ben...! (sustained wincing) Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear,
oh dear, oh dear. I don't know if we're gonna make it.
I don't know if we're gonna make it. I'll build many amusing
walks along our bay. Come on! Here we go,
green light, green light. Oh, four minutes away. Four minutes. It's gonna be... nnngh! (pained grumble) No, red light, red light. No! Park... map. Okay, two minutes. Oh (bleep) You might have to
just jump out, Ben. Fast, fast, fast. Now, now. I'll ban all Adams
from Waitangi Park. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Woo...! Car. They're on this same street, like a block ahead. Okay, keep an
eye out for their car. We're so close, we're so close. Good. Gat. Gat.
Gat. What we're trying
to say here is 'gate.' See, even though we've
filmed our four locations, this challenge is
not technically over until we pass through the
challenge gate on the highway just before the
entrance to the ferry. At that point, the game
will essentially be paused. Basically a mini rest period,
except we're allowed to strategize until we reach the South Island. Okay. I think we're— That's them! That's them!
That's them. That's them, okay. That's them. That's them. That's them.
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, hold on.
That's them. I'm gonna take off
the wig, so that we don't... they don't see that
we're in disguise. Okay. Okay. W–W–Wait. Jump out, jump out, jump out. No, no, they're in the car. (bleep) Okay, okay, okay.
They're in the car. Then we have to
follow behind them. Oh... no. Shh-sh-sh-shh. Good. D-O-N. I good. Okay, wait, wait, but... Wait, does that mean that they— Just keep following them.
Are they done? Wait, but if they're
leaving the waterfront, then that means that they might
have gotten to four already, and they're just going
through the gate. I just— no, like... All we can do is follow them. Got. Okay, the game
is now neutralized. It's basically treated
by a rest period. So the curse is pushed until
the other end of the ferry. But...
What a relief. Oh my god. Let's text them. Let 'em know that we officially
just passed through the gate. Oh, they're not gonna like that. (sigh) So we missed 'em. So they're gonna
make the 1 pm ferry. Seemingly they're
gonna make the 1 pm ferry, which means that
we're on the 3:45. One Nerf bullet and five coins. That was critical. And that was decided by... once again, seconds. We should have just
enough time to make it. Let's see what they're
thinking in the background. Not, not good. Not ideal. Shoot. Hi. Lane three. Thank you. I think that's our boat. Nice. The Kaiarahi. It's a big boat. Here we go. This ferry that
we won by 60 seconds. Alright. Well, we had a little lunch. Yeah. We're... stressed. Yeah, I'm pretty stressed. ...is how I would describe it. We're in trouble. Yeah, yeah. Much like Fleishman,
we're in trouble. That's a great reference, Adam. Yeah, thank you. In a very similar
way to Fleishman, that's the same way
that we are, which is that we're in trouble. Anybody watch
Fleishman [is] in Trouble? Any of our viewers
big Fleishman heads? Seems like we're leaving. Unfortunately, 20 minutes late,
but still a good margin. Okay, well... We are now two hours and
45 minutes behind Sam and Toby, and we have five coins and
a bullet, so the question is... how do we win the game? A big question is just gonna be,
which way do they go? And we don't know yet. Okay, so we
have to decide now. Basically there's
one big west route and one big east route. When we reach the South Island, after completing the
first challenge in Picton, teams will face arguably the
biggest decision point on the map: whether to go east or west. The west route is roughly
10 hours and 20 minutes of driving to the next convergence
with eight challenges. But the challenges are,
at least theoretically, faster and more reliable. The east route has a few options,
but all of them save roughly an hour and a half
worth of driving compared with the west route. Plus, there are fewer challenges. The thing is, the challenges are,
at least theoretically, much harder and riskier. Christchurch could
take hours to complete, and catching a fish in
Kaikōura is a major gamble. Teams will have several
chances to converge later, but this turn will be
one of the most impactful decisions of the game. We haven't
spoke about it yet, but I have a big
preference for one way. I wonder if you do as well. I don't have a strong preference.
Oh, I'll tell you mine. Mine is to go on the east. Okay.
To go that straight path. Because even looking
at the challenges, like you mentioned,
they're kind of risky. They're kind of difficult,
but I think they're doable, and that's our favourite
word for a challenge. I think so. In my opinion... the smart move for
them is to go west. The west route is longer. It actually has more challenges,
but they're all easier. Which means that
proportionally less time will be spent doing challenges,
and more time will be spent driving, which means that following
behind someone going west is not a very good plan, because... The driving time is the same. The only time you gain
is the challenges, and the challenges
are pretty short. Also because... the east route involves
catching a fish. Yeah.
Which... as this show
has shown many times, is much harder than you think.
We caught a fish. We caught a fish in
this part of the world. We did. We did. It's true that we did do that. But that was pretty fluky. I don't know if we
could do it again. I think I'm pro east route. It's just, I'm really
worried about fishing. I'm worried
about fishing too. To be honest,
what I'd love to do is to skip fishing. The thing about
skipping challenges is not only
do we get to skip it, but they still have to do it. Yeah. So... I think skipping the fish
would be so good for us. You know what I'm
just realizing right now? What? They might go east
and skip the fish. They're gonna skip
the fish, aren't they? They might skip the fish. I'm afraid that they
might skip the fish. It'd be a really smart move. It would be a really smart move, because it would
put us in a position where we would have... no good options. (bleep) Let's hope they
don't skip the fish. We'll find out. We have a very
late ferry to go catch. Yep. And we wanna
get there as early as possible. Adam, good news. Sea conditions today are light. We're some of the very
first people to get on the ferry. This could be good. Again, maybe it'll take
them a really long time to get off the ferry.
That'll be huge for us. Then we'll score
another half hour. Yeah. Alright, so it looks
like we've docked in... Pickin'? Picton.
Picton. So we have made it
to the South Island. So we'll see when we get off. How the game restarts essentially, this kind of mini rest period... will end the second we
drive off of this boat. So at that point we will have
35 minutes of curse continued, where we're not gonna talk. Technically, we can talk,
but we're not gonna risk it. So all we have to do is
our little boating challenge. Dock a boat in
Picton Memorial Park. Construct a small boat
out of any material. On the beach,
mark out a one-foot ""dock."" Using only your breath,
guide the boat from a distance of 49 feet or 15 meters
in the water into the dock. But we've made a plan for that. We've taken advantage
of this non-curse time to make a bit of a plan. Here we go! That was a long wait,
but we're finally moving. My last words are, we're gonna dock our boat faster
than they docked this boat, right? Mhm.
Yes. Because we couldn't talk then, I'm gonna walk you through
what happened next in VO. To make our boat,
we went to Hammer Hardware, where we bought two sponges
to serve as a buoyant base. Then we headed over to
Picton Memorial Park, where we built our boat using a paint swatch and a
pencil as a sail. Toby went out into the water
and quickly determined that the boat was too big to be
steered by blowing on it. We switched to the
smaller sponge, tried it again, and it immediately sunk. So we tried the big
sponge without the sail, which didn't work at all. At which point someone
walked up to us and asked... No. And proceeded to tell us that
there were stingrays in the water. Stingray. Stingray. We were already pretty sure
the challenge would take longer than the 60 minute veto period, and the stingray
was the last straw, so we were forced to decide. No do. Not right. V.
V? O–Okay, V? Okay. Okay. So Ben and Adam's microphones
got messed up on the boat, which means good news:
you get more VO. While we waited out
our veto period, they had a blast. They did a Snack Zone, hung out on the deck,
looked at cool islands, and were shocked and
delighted when they realized that between docking,
challenge time, and veto penalty, we've been stuck on Picton
for nearly two hours. They're getting really close.
I don't like this. I saw that. That's why
I started asking you about how long we have left. Yeah, I mean, I think we should be
able to get outta here on time, but we're not gonna have
basically any margin. That really sucks. Their ferry's going so fast.
I don't know how, but... Yeah, and ours was
delayed, theirs is early, and... We basically just eroded all
of our Wellington advantage. See that ship in the distance? That's Ben and Adam. Oh no. 6:42. Let's go. Alright, well
close but not quite. They have now left. But Picton is right there.
That's Picton. I mean, Picton's
right there, and they left... Looks like they're... I mean, six minutes out. Welcome to Picton,
gateway to the South Island. As the ship will been
berthing shortly, those passengers with vehicles are asked to proceed
to the vehicle deck and prepare to drive ashore. Let's go. Alright. We are getting
to the official decision point. Are we going on the... I keep getting this
wrong— east route? 100 percent?
100 percent. A hundred percent? A hundred percent.
We aren't even talking about it. Let's lock it in. I mean, I feel like at this point, Ben and Adam are almost
certainly gonna follow us. I'd be very surprised if
they even the west route. It would be a bold play, and they might need to do
a bold play at this point. But I think given that the
gap has reduced so much, It probably makes sense
for them to follow us, from their perspective. They've gone past... (sigh) East.
Highway six. So yeah, it looks like
they're going east. East, okay. Well, I think that
means we're going west. If they're going east, then they're gonna skip
the fish challenge. And if they're gonna
skip the fish challenge... then that means
we have to do it. And I just think... Yeah. The odds of
us pulling that off in enough time,
it's just too big a risk. We'd just hit more delays. We wouldn't be earning any coins. No. And the thing is... and I don't know if
they realize this. I think the west route
is actually faster. Yeah.
It's longer, but the challenges
are much easier. You don't have to deal
with Christchurch. Okay. Okay. West. We're going west. Hopefully by the
time they get off— It took us like a
good, I don't know, 20–25 minutes to get off. I would guess that
they're gonna be quicker, 'cause I think their
boat was less busy. But still, hopefully it's,
you know, good 10–15. I mean, these
people are moving. These people are moving.
I'm feeling pretty good. I mean, look, this
room is emptying out in a matter of minutes. Yeah, show 'em. I mean, look,
people are moving. I mean, it took them 40
minutes to get off the ferry. But maybe there
was some weird delay. Maybe this is fast.
Yeah. Oh, here we go!
Here we go, here we go. Yeah, I mean, look. That was not too bad at all. No, no.
It was not too bad. That was not too bad. I mean, now we're like, what? We're 45 minutes behind 'em. I mean, we thought it was
gonna be so much worse than that. That is... good news.
That is pretty incredible. Alright, west route,
here we come! So they just found out
that we're going the west route. We're not following them. I wonder if they
were expecting that. Okay, Toby. I have some interesting news. They're going west. No, they're not. No.
They're just kidding with us. No they're—
They've done the turn. They're coming back. That is interesting.
They're coming back. Well... It doesn't seem
like the right move, but it so doesn't seem
like the right move that it almost makes me wonder
if it is the right move, and they're just smarter than us. I guess they're
gonna try to win this with curses and stuff? I don't know
where they're going, or what they're doing. Bold strategy. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus As you all know,
the next episode of Jet Lag is up right now on Nebula, because every single
episode of Jet Lag is released one week
early on Nebula. But here's something
you might not know. Did you know that originally, this channel was not going to
be called Jet Lag: The Game? It was going to be called
America: The Game. Yee-haw. And actually our
internal Slack channel is still called
""America: The Game"" because we can't
change the name of it. The reason it was gonna be
called America: The Game is that every game was
gonna take place in America, because that's all we thought
we'd be able to afford to do. And then towards the end,
we were like, we should change it
to Jet Lag: The Game because that opens us up to do more stuff in different places
if we could ever afford it. And it turned out we were
able to do those seasons a lot sooner than we expected because so many of you
signed up on Nebula to support our show. And that's how we fund
this entire thing. What Nebula basically is, is it's a creator-founded and
creator-run streaming site. And creator-owned actually, too. Basically myself and a bunch
of other creators got together, and we asked, you know, how do we make the best viewing
experience for our audience? And we had a few
different answers to that. You know, first of all,
you know, easy answer. No ads, no sponsorships. It's a subscription-based service. So the revenue source is
from the users themselves. Which cuts out kind of
perverse incentives about, you know,
just optimizing for you know, purely for views rather than for how good
the videos themselves are. Then, you know,
we did other stuff. Like we decided that, you know,
some videos we'd upload early, like every single episode
of Jet Lag. And then we also decided
to do original content. We call them Nebula Originals. We basically use the revenue that
we generate from subscription fees to basically fund big
passion projects by creators. What is the kind of thing
that they would want to do but never had the money
or resources to make? And then we just make it
and put it on Nebula. And so it's a lot of
creators' best work all on this platform,
which I think is so cool. And there's even more, I don't have time
to go into it all. But in all, you know, Nebula is the best viewing
experience for Jet Lag. Because again, no sponsorships,
no ads, one week early. We haven't even mentioned
The Layover, the podcast. You know, the exclusive podcast
that we do every single week. Weekly podcasts! You know, reacting
to a given episode. So it's the best viewing
experience for Jet Lag, and then it's the best
viewing experience for all these
other creators, too. Many of which, I mean,
we actually know from our audience
crossover statistics. We know that many of these
creators you already watch. So, take a look. The best way to sign up
is through our link, nebula.tv/jetlag. And you can get $20 off
an annual subscription. By signing up that way,
you're supporting the show. A part of your subscription
fee will go to us for as long as you
stay subscribed. So, that'll help support the show
and keep everything running and help us fund bigger, more absurd
seasons in the future. Yep, so... Episodes one week early.
Layover podcast. Everything from other creators.
Helps support us. nebula.tv/jetlag

are racing to Wellington. The first team to
complete that challenge at the bottom of the North Island will be able to take
the 1 pm ferry tomorrow, a full two hours and 45 minutes before the next ferry at 3:45. At the moment,
Toby and I are in the lead on our way to Huka Falls. That's the site of
our next challenge. Ben and Adam are
30 minutes directly behind us, and if they want any
hope of overtaking us to get on that first ferry, they're going to have to
hit us with their Nerf gun, which would freeze us
for 30 minutes. Fortunately, they've got
a plan to avoid detection. Alright, we are
headed to Huka Falls. We are locked and loaded. Let's see if this works. Thoughts? It's so big and fast. Yeah. Anyway,
speaking of fast. Wait, wait,
I didn't say hello. No, film me saying hello. Yes, say hello. Hello.
Hello. Hello. Okay, now let's go. Are you using
your sparkling water? I guess so. We need sparkling water,
because our next challenge is: Waterfall at Huka Falls. After saying hello to Huka Falls, one team member must waterfall any beverage into
their teammate's mouth from at least 10 feet above. Once the teammate
receiving the beverage has caught enough to fill
80% of their gold cup, the challenge is complete. I think let's look over here. I might have to climb a tree. Sam. I don't think
that's tall enough. You don't think
it's tall enough? I'm gonna measure 'em here. Oh yeah, just does it. Are you sure?
Yeah. You're gonna have to pour and film. I'm gonna go here so that people are less concerned
by what we're doing. I have to lay all the way down. Oh, this is so cray! Oh, you gotta be quick. Yeah, okay. Go for it. (wheezes) I'm so sorry, Sam. This is really difficult.
That's okay, keep going. Okay, it just updated. It's looking like
they're at the falls now. I mean, who knows how
long this will take? One sparkling
waterfall coming up. We're out. I'm gonna go get another bottle. Alright, it's full. It's full? Check.
Yeah. Alright, let's go. We gotta go. You really took one
for the team there, Sam. At times it felt
like waterboarding, but it's fine, 'cause
we got 15 coins. Okay, well it would seem
that they've just left Huka Falls. We're, what, 13 minutes
behind them? It would seem we may have
put on the dresses for nothing. But we could follow them along the next route,
after the next intersection. Okay, so Ben and Adam
will have to go through that roundabout that
we just went through. I believe they're gonna be
about 10 minutes behind us. One thing that's interesting,
and I'll do some research as we go, but I noticed that
there's a stretch that seems to be really
empty on this route. If we pull the right roadblock, that could be a pretty
devastating spot. So maybe we should
think about that. Well, the route
to Napier is coming up. Yeah, I mean, we could go east and get a lot of powerup points... but the challenge
there takes a while. But we're close enough to them
that I don't want to give up on still leading them to Wellington and getting on the 1 pm ferry. No, and we want to
keep open the possibility of being able to shoot them. So I think we're
gonna follow them, and then we'll see... There's another intersection
where they can go east or west. And we'll see what they do,
and then see how we wanna respond. Okay. I can confirm that
Ben and Adam are following us. They did not go the other route.
Following us. Yeah, yeah. So here's my thinking. I think we have a really good
opportunity now to give them just a
devastating roadblock. Because there's this
really long stretch on the drive that we're doing
that I don't think has any shops. And a lot of the roadblocks
require you to buy something. Alright, well let's
see if we can get— Again, we want brutality. Are we doing it? Yep. So we get... Wear a new hat. Wear a new hat. Buy a new hat and wear it
until the rest period. The hat does not necessarily
need to be advertised as a hat, but should it be removed
for any non-essential reason before the next rest period, you are frozen for
the next 20 minutes. The hat must be at least
the size of your hand. Buy a new hat and wear
it until the rest period. That is perfect!
I love it. Oh! That is not gonna be— That could not have gone better. Yeah. Alright, let me do some research and find a brutal spot to put that. Do you know anything
about that volcano? No... is that Mount... ...Ruapehu? It's... ...Tongariro? I think.
Oh! Do you have any
information to share with us about that mountain, Ben? No. Okay.
Do you? No.
Great. Well then, we'll just— No, I think I do.
I think that this is where... I think... that this is where Mount Doom is. Right, this road
right here to the left... Just past is gonna be our drop spot. Okay, you ready to toss it? Toss, toss it. Ready?
Ready? Go! Alright, Ben and Adam. Good luck finding a hat. Okay, Adam, I've got
some not so great news. Sam is thrown down a roadblock. I mean, it's the only
road we can drive on, so we've just gotta do it. And we'll find out what that
roadblock is when we get there. But hopefully it's an easy one. I mean, the last one they
did was a pretty easy one. That's true. That's true. Alright. We have reached the roadblock. Now we're gonna find out what it is. But let's actually get
outta the car to do it. First of all, 'cause it's beautiful.
And second of all... I'm gonna change out
of my dress. We're gonna
find out what it is. Wear a new hat.
Oh no. Okay. Well, we have to buy it. So we're gonna need to find
what the nearest store is. That would sell
something resembling a hat. Right, it doesn't
have to be a hat... But we do need something. We have to buy something. Let's see what the nearest If there's—
store is. Yeah, if there's not
a store within 15 minutes, then we should just veto it.
Yeah. Because the veto period
for roadblocks is 30 minutes. I've got a feeling... that Sam knew exactly
what he was doing. Yeah, this (bleep) is sparse. God dammit.
Let's look on Google Maps. Sometimes they have—
Okay, lemme get my phone. I mean, I don't—
I literally see like nothing. No, it's literally just— The Google Maps is
just, it's green. Do you see anything? No, I don't
see anything at all. I don't see anything. I literally
don't see anything. I think we
should just veto now. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. Veto, we're vetoing it right now.
Okay, we're vetoing it. Touché, Sam.
That was a well-placed roadblock. Fair enough. Fair play. So what time is it?
(bleep) 6:51. 7:21, we can keep going. Damn it! Mm-kay. That sucks. So you might notice
Ben and Adam are not moving. They'll probably
realize pretty quickly that it's gonna be a tough one
to do there and veto it. But still, 30 minutes,
that's a good amount of window. That's a good margin for us to do the next couple challenges.
That's enough to eat carrots. But yeah, I mean,
I think this will build us a healthy margin for
these challenges. Hopefully for the
Palmerston North challenge to allow us to close in
on Wellington ahead. That's our wish. That's what'll get us
on the right ferry. So here's the next intersection. When we arrive at Tohunga Junction, we'll have two options. We could go west
on a route that's 135 minutes and has one challenge
here in Whanganui. Frankly, it's hard to predict
how hard this one will be. Or we could go east
on a 125 minute route and do two challenges, but both of them are
pretty reliably easy. There's no real need
for us to take a risk, and we should get
more coins going east. So that's our plan, which means
our next challenge is: Eat a carrot at the
Ohakune Carrot Adventure Park. Between both team members, you must consume
one full-sized carrot or five baby carrots
within the boundaries of the Ohakune Carrot Adventure Park. Okay, so in five minutes, we'll be at the
supermarket in this town. Every minute matters at this point. So it's just
super, super quickly. I'm gonna look for baby carrots. Big carrot we'd have to
peel and stuff. I can eat a full carrot.
It's not that big a deal. The soil is good for you,
gives you selenium. Yeah, New World Supermarket. Alright, good news,
no carrot shortage. Alright, I got a
few different options. There's this short and stubby one,
a long and thin one. I think this one seems
like the lowest volume one. I really hope it's fine that we
haven't peeled it or washed it. I wouldn't have thought twice
about eating a carrot that I just bought
at the supermarket. Alright, we should
see the carrot soon. Oh, I see. Oh, well, I think
that's probably it. Wonder how this town
has decided on ""Let's make a big
carrot adventure park."" Alright, let's go. Okay, welcome back to...
Alright. Wait, wait. I had a line
I wanted to do. Oh, you have a line?
Okay, great. Alright, we're
still in the veto period, but more than that... We're in The Snack Zone. Welcome back to
Snack Zone, baby! It's a show within a show where we review
New Zealand's very best and sometimes very worst snacks. And these are Baked Oaty Slices. See, the thing is,
I don't know if this is iconic or popular or anything.
We just found it. This is what annoys
me about those ""Oh, we're trying American snacks"" and it's just stuff
I've never seen before. Yeah.
So I don't know if— This might be nothing.
These are Afghan flavored. I don't really know what that means,
but it seems to have pictures of walnuts and chocolate and some other things that
I can't figure out what they are. It is oaty. Here's a carrot. Here, break it in half. What, you haven't
broken it in half yet? I was filming! Oh, no.
One person, it's just too short. Okay. There we go. But now you're not gonna want it,
'cause you don't want my germs. It's fine. I'll sacrifice here. Come here, come here. Alright, let's go. Oh, good carrot. I wish we had time to
play in the Adventure Park. (coughs profusely) Eating it too aggressively. Alright, I'm gonna get
directions while you finish up. I think that's it.
One more little bit? It's still my carrot.
One more little... Come on, we gotta go!
We're to race! Alright, that's it.
That's just the stem. Oh my god, come on, come on! Urgency! I have to finish the challenge. I know. I'm saying urgently finish. This is still a carrot.
I know. Urgently finish! No, I'm still fine.
Okay okay, sorry. Don't mean to rush you.
Take all the time you need. Don't eat the stem. I'm not eating the stem. That is the stem. Okay, there we go, let's go. And now we have more snacks. Alright, send it. Okay, our 30 minutes is up. So we can continue
along our route. Fair play to Sam and Toby. That was a well-placed roadblock. You bastards. Looking at the tracker, Sam and Toby have taken
the turn towards Okahune. So we have to decide
if we wanna follow them or if we want to go the other way
towards Palmerston North. Okay, so here's my logic then. The challenges that they're doing
on that route are very easy. So yeah, they're
clearing them for us, but it's not like it's
actually helping that much. No, we're not gonna
catch up that much. No. So we might as well... just take the other route and actually get some
more powerup coins... in Whanganui. And we'll converge in
Palmerston North anyway. Yeah, and I don't want to
get hit with another roadblock. No, that's the other thing. I mean, they've
made it clear that if we follow behind them,
that they're gonna drop roadblocks. Yeah, I agree.
Let's go towards Whanganui. Yeah.
And hopefully... we'll be able to
catch up after that. It's the po-po. Oh, he's getting a talking to. Ben and Adam.
Oh yeah, news. Ben and Adam, they have
continued to Whanganui. So they're not following
us down this route. Which seems to make sense,
'cause they need those 15 coins. They've probably just
had enough following us. Alright, we're
turning right soon. We're looking for the giant gumboot and the Gumboot Throwing Lane.
It's right there. There's the giant gumboot. The giant gumboot
means we're in Taihape, the location of our next challenge: Throw a gumboot at the
Taihape Gumboot Throwing Lane. Taihape, the self-described
gumboot capital of the world, is home to a massive annual
gumboot throwing competition. At the Taihape
Gumboot Throwing Lane, throw a gumboot at least 15 meters. We gotta be efficient about this. This makes or breaks whether
or not we make the ferry. Okay, so take this right. I did the math on the ride here. We do have a shot of
making the 1 pm ferry. So it's gonna be this right. But it's tight. It is very tight. Oh yeah, there's our
gumboot throwing lane. Here, I think, park here. Oh, I think I see some gumboots. That's going to save us our— That's gonna get us our 15 coins. Alright, let's send it. It shows 10 meters, 20 meters. So we need to get it to here. Men's record, 56 meters.
Women's record, 36. Okay, I don't think
this'll be hard. You ready? Holy (bleep), sorry!
Whoa! (laughs) Almost sat on the train tracks. Ready for this?
Yeah. Okay. That's... bold approach. Okay. Oh, that was it. That was it. That was it, that was 20. That was beautiful. Let's go. What a delightful sport. Yeah. Back on Route One.
Still the exact same highway as the one we started on
up in Cape Reinga. Would ya look at that? Oh my god, what?
Look at those! You know the motto. What's the motto? Anything for views. Anything for views. Oh, look at that!
Look at those views! Awoo! Hold that out there.
Oh god. ♪ It's pretty ♪ And you know who gets
to enjoy that pretty landscape? This is just incredible.
It's just sheep. It's just for sheep. I wonder if the sheep appreciate it. I wonder if the sheep
are like, ""This rocks."" One thing I have to remind
myself going through this, 'cause we're so focused
on the game, is just how far
from home we are here. On these drives, like now,
when we have really nice lighting, great views, and we know
that we don't have any more challenges left for today. This is exactly when I'm like, I finally feel like
I'm able to take it all in. And that's super nice. Yeah, these
cows are on the hill. Hey friends. No big deal. No big deal. Just cows on a hill. Cows on a Hill would be a
pretty good name for a band. Yeah, I agree. Seconds left in day two. There we go, that's it. Right... right there. Right at the school sign. That was our spot. It is 8:59 and
a bunch of seconds. Oh, and now it's 9. And we'll see you here this
exact time tomorrow morning. Okay, it's 9 pm,
which means day two is over. That's right, we're only through
two out of our five days. The game is now paused
while both teams find a hotel, go to sleep, and dream of
making the 1 pm ferry tomorrow. And now through the magic
of YouTube, it's 8 am. Alright, it's 8 am.
8 am, okay. Let's go, go, go, Sam. Happy 8 am. Happy 8 am to you, buddy. Alright, every
minute matters today in terms of whether or not
we can make that first ferry. The good news is both
of our challenges I think are rather short
and straightforward. Mount Cleese... If we're supposed to
summit Mount Cleese. Summit Mount Cleese. After British comedian John Cleese
described Palmerston North as the ""suicide capital of New Zealand"", Palmerston North renamed
their dump to Mount Cleese. Reach the top of the
45.2 meter mountain that has been dubbed
Mount Cleese. Then we'll be off to, presumably, I think we want to
do the western route, the one that involves walking
through the woods blindfolded. As long as there's a chance for
us to get on that first ferry, taking the shortest route
seems to make the most sense. Yeah, I think so.
That's what I wanna do. I suspect that
Ben and Adam know that. And therefore I suspect that we might have some
curses hailed our way. I think the
name of the game today is just to do
everything in our power to stop them from making that ferry. I don't think that we
can make that ferry. No. But I do think that potentially
we can prevent them from making it, and then we're both on the 3:45. And I think the
first thing we should do is buy a curse.
Yeah, okay. Curse stack. I'm gonna go ahead, pull a curse. Okay.
Is it a good one? No, it is not a good one. What is it? You have to
listen to Tom Lehrer's ""Element Song"" loudly on repeat until you reach your next challenge. That's not great. Shoot.
It's funny, and it's annoying. And I would love to
put this on them. But it's not gonna do
what we need it to do. We don't have enough
for another curse, but we will after we
complete Whanganui. Shoot. Okay. So let's go complete Whanganui, and then we can reassess and see if we have any other way to slow them.
That's not great. That's not great. Okay, so just in case
we haven't explained yet, let's talk about what
the Whanganui challenge is. Find Whanganui and Wanganui. Whanganui has voted several times on whether or not to
spell its name with an H, which it has in its traditional
Māori pronunciation. No widespread consensus
has been reached. Find three signs
that say ""Whanganui"" and three signs that say ""Wanganui."" I would say that this
is looking relatively dense. Yeah.
Here. Okay, parking. Okay, so it's just three of each?
You're sure? Yep, and I would look
right behind you. Alright, Wanganui with no H. Right there.
Okay, let's get a move on. (whispers)
Wanganui, Whanganui... Okay, there's a... big banner. Does it say anything? Oh, it might. Oh wait. Yeah, oh, ooh. ""Wanganui Branch"" there. That's without an H. So we've got two without.
Two without an H. We don't have any with. Oh, there's one,
another without an H. Oh, yeah, yeah. So you see that, so. ""Wanganui Branch."" Okay, so we're all
good without the H. So now we need the Hs. Ooh, I think that says Whanganui.
Official. Wait, is that an H? That's an H, yeah. Wait, wait, right here.
BNZ, right there. That says Whanganui with an H. Kiwibank. Oh, oh yeah, yeah. Kiwibank. Whanganui with an H.
Okay, that's three of each. That's very fast.
That's three of each. Great work.
Good, efficient challenge. Back to the car.
That was very efficient. Woo! How many coins was that? I have no idea. Okay, now I'm
just gonna route us straight to Palmerston North, right? Welcome to beautiful,
sunny Palmerston North. Exhilarating, right? I think this is the
entrance to Mount Cleese. aka the landfill. Alright, we're climbing up. There's the sign. Okay, so that's 30 coins. I think another curse. I think we gotta
buy another curse. 'Cause if they get
on that 1 pm ferry... We're in trouble.
We're so screwed. Okay, we're
buying another curse. Okay. Curse is... Oh, this is not helpful either. No, really? What is it? For the next three hours,
you may not say any words with the letter E in them. Anytime you say the letter E,
you must stop walking or pull over your vehicle
for five minutes. The Wellington challenge
involves a lot of talking. That's true. So let's wait.
Let's wait. Damn it, that sucks!
We had two bad curses! We just blew through 50 coins. 50 coins. 50 coins for
two garbage curses. The Element Song
will be funny though. Will be funny,
but that sucks, man! Okay, well hopefully
Palmerston North will take them longer
than expected or something. Alright, we've summited. Well, we gotta go. Alright, no
time to look around. No. Now let's confuse
the person at the gate by leaving immediately. Alright on the road down to... I forget the name of the next thing. The hiker thing.
The blindfolded hike thing. The blindfolded hike thing. Lead your teammate
through the jungle blindfolded. Blindfold one teammate. The other teammate must lead them
along the Mangaone Walkway until they reach the
marked stream crossing, and then lead them back. We should check what
Ben and Adam are up to. Whether they've left
Whanganui yet. See what sort of margin we have. They have left Whanganui. They're on the highway. Okay.
It's gonna be a race. Adam to us, 31 minute drive. Okay. That's a nice margin. Yeah. But I think we want to grow it, because this challenge could
take more than 30 minutes. Wellington could definitely
take more than 30 minutes. What do you think?
Should we pull a roadblock? Yeah.
And then take the top one. Eat something grape flavored. Eat something grape flavored. It must clearly say on the packaging
that it is grape flavored. Grapes count. Okay, that can be decent. That takes some time
if we leave it far enough from a gas station or
anywhere that they can buy. Maybe you want to research
along our route south a good spot to drop that. Okay. Alright, so best we can tell, this is the last gas
station for a little bit. So we're gonna drive,
you know... 15 minutes this way
before dropping the pin. Hopefully Ben and Adam cannot
find anything grape-flavored in anywhere closer to our pin. That is the devilish plan
that we've concocted here. Alright, Adam, welcome
to Palmerston North. Thank you so much. We have nothing to do here. We're just gonna continue
right on through. Yep. And hopefully we'll catch up. Alright, just
after this intersection. Ready?
You get ready. Three, two, and one. Go.
Go. Okay, well... our time in Palmerton
North is not going well. They've just thrown
down a roadblock. Ugh, okay.
So now I don't think we'll be able to catch up
to them at the river crossing. No, I think they probably
saw that move coming. Yeah, probably. (bleep) So this curse we're
putting on them now. Hopefully it does something. Yeah.
That's all we can hope for. I'll let them know. I've just had a text
arrive from Ben saying, new curse on you. Oh?
For the next three hours, you may not say any words
with the letter E in them. Anytime you say the letter E,
you must stop walking or pull over your vehicle
for five minutes. No talk. Okay. At least... they're kind of annoyed right now. At least they can't
say the letter E. And hopefully that's
making them suffer. Walk is one hour. Ah. No talk. I'm trying to remember
what the roadblocks are. Touch a body of water could be. There's a river right there. Oh, there is? Yep. I'm trying to think. Are there other roadblocks
that involve buying things? Yes. Eat something grape flavored. Eat something grape flavored.
Yeah, that could hurt. Yeah, I'll just have to see. Look at those mountains.
Pretty cool. ♪ Pretty ♪ Throw an object back and forth at least 10 times
without dropping it. You must stand at
least 20 feet apart. Okay. We haven't even gotten
to the first roadblock, and they just dropped another one. Agh! They're really throwing
a wrench in the works. Let's find out
what this roadblock is. Okay, what is it? Damn! Eat something grape flavored. It's the one we didn't— It's the specific one
we didn't want it to be. Okay, let's see. Okay, we need
to look really quickly if we can get to anywhere where we could buy
something grape-flavored. Gas stations or
convenience stores behind us. Okay, there's a
gas station back here. How far? 22 minute drive. So it's not worth it to go. It's faster to veto. And there're no
convenience stores? I mean, I don't see one. No, I mean this is
just this, it's just this. I mean there's
a gas station, like... like 0.1 miles in front of us. But we can't pass forward.
We can't pass the roadblock. Veto, veto now. 9:33 veto.
We're vetoing it. (bleep) Ends at 10:03. 10:03, okay. Well... Sam and Toby,
well played once again. Sam. Right. Loft. Right. Loft. Fast. Alright, well,
veto period complete. Yep. That was a long 30 minutes. But now we're onto
the next roadblock. Okay, here we are
at this roadblock. Let's go ahead... and find out. Okay, okay,
hurry, hurry, hurry. What is it? What is it?
What is it? Play catch. Throw an
object back and forth at least 10 times without dropping, and you must stand
at least 20 feet apart. Okay, that's fine.
We can do that. We can do that really fast. Here we go. 10 catches without dropping it. Here we go. One. Slow. Fast. Stop. Follow. Two. It might be easier or
safer to throw underhand. Sure. Three.
Three. This is easy. Four.
Four. Plank. Straight. No talk. Five.
Five. Six.
Six. Seven. Doing really good.
Seven. Ah! Turn. Go back. Slow. Eight. There you go. Last one.
Nine. Ten... Ten. Okay, done it. Let's go, go, go. Okay, that we nailed. So now we need to
route to Peka Peka. We might still be
able to catch up to them. Stop. Okay, because we can't do a
great explanation in-game right now, here's the next challenge
located in the city of Wellington. The first team to complete this
can get on the earlier 1 pm ferry. That is assuming they
complete it in time. Run for Prime Minister. One team member must
run for Prime Minister by making promises in front of at least four different
prominent locations within New Zealand's
capital, Wellington. Knit. So they're leaving the
river crossing challenge. So we'll be maybe
20 minutes behind them. So we'll arrive in Wellington
just a bit behind them. Yeah, maybe like
15 minutes behind them. That is still enough time. What's happening? Little bit of a traffic situation.
What's happening? Track boys. On way. I think the only
way we can stop them from getting on the 1 pm ferry is by shooting them. Oh god! If we don't hit them, they'll enter the South Island
almost three hours ahead. Nightmare. I'm hoping that we
will be caught up to them in the time it takes
them to buy a tie. Any delay that they experience... I think is enough. Yeah.
To stop them. Okay. No mistak-s. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Kia ora, I'm Toby, running for top job. Nooo! That's them! That's them!
That's them. Oh... no. Shh-sh-shh! Sea conditions
today are light. It always is like, Wait, do they know
something I don't? Are they smarter than us? We don't know.
We don't know. The entire season has been
leading up to this one moment, the Battle of Wellington! Will Toby and I get that devastating two hour and
45 minute head start, or will we have it
ripped away from us at the last minute by these guys laughing maniacally off into
the sunset or something? I don't know. You can find out right now
if you're a Nebula subscriber. And that's because we put
every single episode out one week early for
our Nebula subscribers in appreciation of the fact that
they basically fund the show. And you know, what makes
Nebula an even better deal is we're not the only
one that's doing that. Yeah, people actually
loved the thing where we put Jet Lag episodes a week
early on Nebula so much that Nebula created this whole new
system called Nebula First, and now all of these
other creators do it, like Not Just Bikes or
LegalEagle. So you can watch all
of these YouTube videos from all of your favorite creators a whole cycle early
on Nebula. And Nebula's got a whole bunch
of other great exclusive stuff, like the companion podcast
for this show, The Layover, where we break down each episode
and we answer your questions. And you can listen to
that only on Nebula. It's a lot of fun.
I really like doing the podcast. Yeah, it's great 'cause we love having these
conversations anyways, 'cause we only get to
see our side of the show. Right. And so I think we
always have questions when we start to see the footage
and start to see the edit of ""Oh, why did you do that, Adam?"" And this is the—
and now we just get— It's kind of our job to
have those conversations. Which is great, and we
get to reconnect with Toby. Yeah, Ben and I
get to hang out— Ben and I hardly got to
hang out with Toby at all during the season,
so now we get to— And it was two months ago
when we filmed, so now it's great. The reason we do all this
for our Nebula subscribers is because they quite
literally fund this show. I mean, that has been basically
all of the revenue for Jet Lag since the day it was founded, and we've been able
to grow off of that. So we're super appreciative
of their support through time. And, we're actually... For anyone who really wants
to help support this, We're trying something
kind of experimental. We don't know if it'll work,
but yeah, it's a little weird. So we are now
offering on Nebula a lifetime subscription. You can become a subscriber
to Nebula forever. You never have to pay Nebula
any more money ever. You will always have
access to the service. Now, it is not necessarily
the cheapest way to get access to Nebula. That's the annual bundle.
You can totally do that. But if you want to especially
support the show, right? If you want to really kind of do
this crazy thing to help support us, you can, and you
get access forever. And what that is really great for is it gives us all of
this revenue right now that we can put towards
making future seasons. Yep, and regardless
of how you wanna sign up, You can do so at
nebula.tv/jetlag. And you know,
if use that link, again, we'll get a portion of your
subscription fee for life. And you'll actually also get
$20 off an annual subscription. It's a great deal for you.
And, yeah. So thank you in advance
for your support and good bye! Good bye!"

back to episode four of our race to the
bottom of New Zealand. Just as a refresher, the highway system has been
turned into a board game. Players have to clear
challenges to progress, and powerups can be used
to sabotage the other team. Right now, both teams
are in Auckland competing to see who can
complete the Auckland challenge and claim its
massive reward first. Toby and I were feeling
good about our chances, because we had just
cursed Ben and Adam with a devastating walking curse,
where they have to roll a die every time they
want to take a step. But the tables turned at
the end of the last episode, where Ben and Adam managed
to hit us with their Nerf gun before we could
claim any volcanoes, freezing us at the
Sky Tower for 30 minutes while they were free to
roll their way to victory. Yes!
(triumphant laugh) Yes! Alright, hurry, hurry! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Roll it. It clear— I was sure
they were buying stuff, 'cause it showed them across... It showed them right
in that building. Damn. Overconfidence. I— Well, let's see. We touched. We got shot. They ran away. One, two, three. You wanna get scooters and
go to the first volcano? Yeah, I think
that might be fastest. Okay, so here's how the
Auckland challenge works. Auckland is built on
a large volcanic field consisting of 53 volcanoes. We have to travel to
the top of five of them, spread across at least
three different basalts, which are these
blobby regions here, and then destroy a ring each time,
Lord of the Rings style. The closest volcano
to the Sky Tower is this one here, Albert Park, which is where Ben and
Adam are headed first. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So this is Hobson. We have to go this way. Okay. You lead the way. Gotta learn
from experience, Sam. Somehow, they knew
exactly the right one to be. How smart are they?
Dang. I guess they figured out
we would come from that direction. How did they know we
were coming to this pylon? They must have known we
were coming from that way, so... We're not walking! Bye! That's a little cheeky. I don't think you're allowed
to bike on the sidewalk. Which way? Which way? One more block. I think that's another
Uber bike up there, Ben. Let's switch to it. You okay? You okay?
You okay? Whoa, whoa, you okay? Yeah. Start by going downhill. Yeah. You got it? (clattering) No. So we have to
get to the top... of the volcano. Probably unlikely to
be able to complete this challenge before them. Unless we go on the offensive now. So I think when this is done... we should hunt them down. Alright, I'm pretty
sure this is the top. Yeah. I bet the
fountain's the middle. Let's go there. The one ring.
We are at the top of a volcano. Volcano one down.
Okay, that's one down. Okay, where's the next one? I think we should bike
as much as we can. It's a nine minute bike.
I think that— Yeah, that's
worth it for sure. It's definitely worth it. Taking a right here. So it looks like
they're at Albert Park, which is presumably
their first volcano. Well, they've been
at Albert Park for a while, and they're, I think,
on those bikes. I think they've done
one volcano of the five. Yeah, they're going down. I wonder if they're
going to Grafton now. On a bike, do you think? Yeah.
Yeah. They could be on the bike. It can't want us to go
through that bridge, can it? Just stay to the left! Which way? This is it. Oh, this is it? Welcome to Grafton. This is a neighborhood in Auckland that was just paved
over a volcano. So we're gonna
destroy another ring. Sorry.
Sorry. That's volcano number two, and the next one is
only three minutes away. Oh, really? Follow me. Wait, wait. If you're gonna walk the bike,
I have to roll the dice for you. Alright. You can take five steps. Okay. One... Two... This is the Auckland domain. I guess let's go to the middle. So it seems that there's
no more path to the top, and we don't wanna
bike on the grass. That seems rude. We're gonna have to roll, okay? Okay, six. One, two, three, four...
Love it. Do you have the burger rings? Oh, nope. Roll. Three. Well, what we should
do is complete the curse once we're done with the freeze. Just run to two
McDonald's quickly, 'cause that'll free us
up to follow them, right? Three, two, one. And we're free, okay. Alright, here we
are at McDonald's. That looks like a ring. Yeah, I mean, bagels
are definitely rings. We can use both ends,
so I think we only need three. So I'll get three Benedict Bagels. And then remove
some of the ingredients? Yeah, same charge. Oh, that's just bread! Thank you. Bag secure. Okay. Five. Oop. Four. ...three, four. Six. Great work. This is interesting. Okay, I'll
destroy this ring. Is this tree... Seems significant.
It's framed. I hope, I think that's
some significance. Maybe we'll put that up on screen. That's volcano number three. Number three of five.
Okay, here we go. Six! Gorgeous. They're at the
Auckland domain now. It looks like it'll take them
a good while to get back here, where presumably their car is. So I think we'll have
time to do Albert Park, run back to the Sky Tower, hopefully find a
way to cut them off. Let's just track
them almost constantly, and our plan's gonna change. Depending on if we think
they're close enough to catch. Okay. God. Okay, looks like that's
the center up there. Ready? You rip it in half. You don't want to eat it? We rip half each. Okay. There. Okay. We're back. So back up towards the Sky
Tower to hopefully cut 'em off? Mhm. So I think the key
is gonna be to figure out where their car is. Then we can maybe find a spot, like a hidden spot at the entrance
to the car park or something. Oh, if we could wait
by their car and find it, that would be amazing. And we have to route
back to the car now. Oh, we do? Yeah, 'cause the other
ones are too far away. That sucks. There's not one
that's closer to here? No. You've checked the map?
You're sure? Okey doke. Let's go to the car. Here we go. We're biking on a highway. This is what the map said to do. I don't love this,
but we're gonna make it through. And it's gonna be okay. How many do
you think they have? I have no (bleep) clue. I wonder if there's
any other car parks. We didn't see them when we
drove into the car park. Do you think we should
look in this car park? Yeah. Nothing. Nothing. No. Nothing. We're not that far. We're doing good. Wait, let's get
onto the sidewalk. We turn? We are off the highway.
That was terrifying. That was terrifying. Damn, that sucks. Let's check the tracker. Yeah, they're not far at all. Yeah, they're... just blocks away. Anyway, I guess they're
coming from this way, yeah. So... Yeah, I think this is unlikely,
but we might as well try. Here, let's hide around
the entrance to that. Can you just
check where they are? Not right now. Okay, fair enough. I think this is a
great hiding spot. Okay, they're right... See if I can... I think we want to go one... Well, no, actually,
let's go this way. Oh, wait.
There he is. There he is. Sorry. Sorry. They're coming. They're coming.
They're coming. There it is, the Sky Tower. Yeah, yeah. Oh—! Oh (bleep)! I got you. I got you. For sure. For sure.
100 percent. (bleep) He got you? Start the timer... Okay, they're frozen.
Let's go. Let's go. Bye, kids! I can't believe that worked. Okay... so Grafton
Volcano next, right? Yep. Picking up where they left off. We're basically covering
what they just did, and then seeing who
can get the rest. We hadn't looked
at where they were. We knew there was a
possibility, but we just... We were on a (bleep) highway. We were literally
biking along the highway. We also didn't think that
he'd be able to get us while we were on bikes, but... He's a sharp shooter. I think down? We were on something like this. Bye! I don't know how
many volcanoes they got. Yeah, I have no idea. It can't have been that many. Maybe none. I think we're still in it. We're definitely still in it.
We only have two more to go. And they should
both be pretty easy. Well, 'cause the thing is they not only had
a 30 minute wait, they must have waited
here for a while. I think we're
definitely still in this. Okay, we're just above. We just need to run down
that road, 20 meters. Alright, let's go.
Let's go, go, go. This would be in it, yeah. Alright. Disappointing. Those people. Wonder what everyone thinks. We have 12 minutes to go. Mm-kay. The second the
12 minutes is up, we'll bike as close
to the car as we can. Yeah. Then we'll roll
dice to walk to the car. Then we're gonna do
Mount Saint John. And then we have to
go to one more basalt. So we have to go a little east. Yeah, Little Rangitoto. Okay, great. Parking is gonna be
hard for them. That's part of why we did bikes. But maybe we're overestimating
the difficulty of parking? We'll just see. I think it's pretty
neck and neck right now. Go straight. So you're 100% sure
about no McDonald's on the way to Rangitoto? No. You're not?
No, I checked. And there wasn't any on
what was the direct route. Okay. Go to the right. Three, two, one.
Ready? Here we go. Okay, let's put them here. Okay, five. Love it.
Three, four, five. Right, we're still
very much in this! Okay. Let's boogie. I've got the bagel. Three. Oh, it's moist! Okay, let's go. There's a bit of cheese. Oh, they're driving. They've just left the city.
They're on Hobson Street. I think it's pretty much go,
go, go is the approach right now. Yeah. We're not gonna
go to Mount Saint John. We're just looking at that.
It's pretty tall. It's tall and
we're too slowed down. With the dice. So we're gonna go to one
that's a little further called Te Pou Hawaiki,
which is a little out of the way, but it's seemingly just
another neighborhood. It's like a volcano
that got flattened. Yes, which is allowed,
is specifically allowed. So this one should
be easier for us to Yeah, totally.
do quickly. Okay, so this volcano
is at the intersection of Cecil Road and
Epsom Avenue. So we actually won't
have to even walk at all. No, we can just get right
out of the car and do it. Okay, so this is Epsom up here. It's this intersection. Alright. Five. One, two, three, four, five. Two. Six. One, two... Okay, this is good. So this inter— I mean,
right here, this is— We're on top of a volcano. Flattened. There you go. Volcano number four.
Okay, that's four. Alright, let's hurry,
let's hurry, let's hurry. Perfect on the parking. I think probably
right here, right? Oh, yes. We're in. Yeah, that's
the zone right there. Alright, let's just run
right in, right out. Done, back. Okay, what do you think now? Let's check with— I need one more minute
to look at the map. Before you drive, can I just... That's where we've just done. That's a crater in the ocean.
We can't go there. That's where I wanna go,
Mount Hobson. Mount Hobson. It's just all down to how fast
we can get up it, I guess. Yeah. They're a couple
blocks behind us. It's a small park. Okay. I think we need a Nerf bullet. Okay. We're gonna
arm ourselves. We're gonna spend 10 coins
on another Nerf bullet, because it looks like we might be
going for the same last volcano. Yep. We are loading a
bullet into the gun. Just in case. This is what
Mount Hobson looks like. Yeah.
If we park in there... It might be steep,
but we might get to the top. Yeah, it's
just gonna be a run. It might be really steep. Well, too late to change now. It's too late to change. That's them! Wait. Why are they going that way? Do you think
that's the entrance? Yeah. (bleep)
Sorry. Go, go, go. You didn't park, Sam.
You didn't park, Sam. I did parking brake. Let's go, let's go. Whatever, doesn't matter. All we have to do is
focus on our volcano. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know where they're going. And we're five minutes away. So, I mean... (bleep) Ben. Didn't lock the car,
but it's a problem for the— Go, go, go, go.
I need to lock. Oh my god.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up. I don't know if it's stress
or all the burger rings. Yeah.
Probably both. Probably both, okay. Once this car goes... This is the park. This is the park up here. I'm just gonna
park behind these people. Sorry! A little bit further! It's right over there. One, two, three. Okay, it's just up that hill.
Six. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Bagel! Done! Texting, texting, texting. Three!
Ah (bleep)! They texted. That was amazing. I can't believe we
pulled that off. Okay, shall we? I don't leave Jet Lag
in an ambulance. Haven't tried hard enough. (bleep) Really?! Oh, sorry, there's
a playground there. I'm so sorry! No. No! That's literally, I mean,
Ben, that's literally... maybe 45 seconds? It was there. If we got there, we would've won. Feeling good. Ben said that they were
50 feet from the summit. Whew. So, the run was worth it. That was really tight. Oh my god, I knew it was. Because when I was running up, I just knew it was close. And I was so suffering. But I thought...
Yeah, the effort was worth it. The last thing I want
is to lose this by a second. That was so devastating that it seems like it was staged. Literally, literally 50 feet. I can't— I just— I know that sometimes
people are like, ""Oh, they stage
(bleep) on this show."" That is absolutely what
just happened to us. Okay, we gotta get... to the stupid goddamn gate. (bleep) That sucks, Ben! I can't believe that. I cannot believe that! So we are off. So we do still have to stop
at one more McDonald's. But it's a little cheeky, but it was designed this way
to be a little cheeky. Ben and Adam
are not allowed to pass through the next
gate until we do. So there's a McDonald's
on the way to the highway. Oh, okay, before the gate.
Yeah. So we're just gonna
have to stop at that one. So we'll complete that, and then we'll be
down to Hamilton. Oh my god!
I'm just— And this is such a
horrible thing to do, but I'm just imagining my head, any number of things that had we done them
30 seconds faster... Yeah. It's like even if we had
rolled better numbers on the dice. That's what we call... content.
I'm genuinely... ...shell-shocked. Maybe shell-shocked
isn't an appropriate word to use for how I'm feeling. I'm just shocked.
I'm regular shocked. No, I would
say that we suffer as much as soldiers do. Thank you. Mac 'N Cheese Bite review. I'm a little whelmed. Well, they've just
passed through the gate. They've passed
through the gate, so we can go through it now. Now the roads diverge. And they diverge quite a bit. We are approaching Hamilton, which is where things deviate. So we have got to decide. Okay, here we reach one of the biggest
route divergences on the map. But before I explain it to you, let me tell you why making
it through this next region first is so important. As you may have noticed,
New Zealand has two islands connected by a ferry. Whichever team gets
here to Wellington first and completes its challenge
will earn tickets on a ferry two hours and 45 minutes
earlier than the other team's. It's a huge advantage. Now let's talk about
this divergence. It starts with a simple choice:
east or west. This side leads to two options. Normally it would be three, but this road,
and therefore this route, shut down for maintenance today. Of the remaining options,
this one's faster, but you have to knit
and make cheese. This route's slower,
but all you have to do is Zorb and
go to a hot spring. If you really wanna get ahead,
you could go west, but it's a bargain. You can unlock what's
by far the fastest route, but only by completing a
difficult challenge: milk pong. You only have five attempts
to throw a ping pong ball into a solo cup full of milk
from eight feet. If you can't, vetoing isn't
an option for this one. So the road stays locked, and you're forced onto
a much longer route with several difficult challenges. So, as is often the case,
teams must decide just how much risk
they're willing to bear. I'm a bit on the fence
between the two options. Ugh! I genuinely have no
idea what we should do. I mean, milk pong is... That's tough. That's risky. That's very risky. uuuaaaAAAAGH! I dunno. The milk pong thing
is so nerve-wracking. It scares the hell out of me. The milk pong is sort of
like a Hail Mary route, and we don't need a Hail Mary. We're right behind.
No. But if they go east, I'm also really scared
to follow behind them. Because they
have a lot of powerups, and they can slow us
down with roadblocks. We could both go east and then take different
routes in the east. So there's
a route going east that does this... Zorb track. That's what I would
predict that they would do. And so we could go
around the other way, but there are two pretty
challenging things that we would have to do.
It's faster. But we would
have to knit a square and we would
have to make cheese. You know how to knit, right? I can do the knitting. Okay, we just
need to get materials. It's actually
just the cheese. It's actually an easy trip, except for the cheese. I don't think
they'll do that route, because I don't think
they know how to knit. And I don't really
want them following us. Should we— okay,
should we lock it in? Should we go for that? Yeah. I'm happy
to do the knitting. Yeah, and there's a
Knit World in Hamilton if we wanna go there. That's, yeah, yeah. Okay, well... we are in the lead. They got to
the decision point. They stopped and started driving
around in Hamilton. Yeah. So we passed them. Which means that
they've now left open what we believe is the
best route through this region. It includes the Zorb track. Yes.
Which is our next challenge. We just gotta Zorb quick. We do have to
do a very quick Zorb. We have to do one of the quickest
Zorbs anyone's ever seen. Complete a ZORB track. At least one team member
must complete any track available at Zorb. Zorb, by the way, is a thing
where you roll down a hill in a big inflatable ball. Why is it called Zorb? No idea. Thank you.
Thank you. Okay, we are now on
our way out of Hamilton. We're making it to Tirau.
It's our first stop. Knit a square in front
of a giant metal sheep. Tirau is well-known for
its giant metal sheep. In this challenge,
teams must knit a square of at least two inches
by two inches in front of the sheep. Looks like the
boys are going up. They're not going to Tirau. They've passed the junction. So they're going
to the Zorb route. They're going
to the Zorb, yeah. I would— personally,
I would love to Zorb, but I don't think that
it's the right move here, 'cause all of their
slowdowns yesterday seem to be to go to
places like Zorbing. Zorb. Zorb. Zorb. Zorb.
Zorb. Zorb. Zorb. Zorb. Zorb! Zorb! Zorb!
Zorb! Zorb! Zorb! ZORB! ZORB! ZORB!
Zorb! Zorb! Zorb! We're Zorbin', baby. Oww, ahh! We're Zorbin'. Eyy, we're gonna do a
little bit-a Zorbin', y'know! Oh, it's very pretty up here.
There's so little— Ooh, show everybody. Beautiful! ♪ Oh, we're Zorbin' ♪ It's like we're in
Oz or something. Wow! The trees are pretty cool. We're gonna Zorb the fastest
anybody has ever Zorbed in their (bleep) life. So I guess
we go down there... and then they send
you up to Zorb. Welcome to Tirau! Oh wait, I think I see it there. Oh yeah, wow, yeah.
The white thing. That's pretty giant.
There's a dog and a sheep. There it is. Yeah, I gotta say, that is the largest
sheep that I've seen. Do you want a tutorial? I want
as fast as possible. The first step is I
have to cast on the stitches. Good luck, Adam! Okay, this actually is
more frightening than I expected. Here we go. It's supposed to be
[indistinct]. You alright? I'm ready. Oh my god! Oh no! (laughs ecstatically) Alright. Whoa! Just knitting. Last couple of stitches here. My handy pink little pocket knife. And then... Alright, quick measure.
Got a little jellyfish. We want at least two
inches by two inches. Easy, oh, by far. More than enough.
Alright. Nicely done.
That was so efficient. I think this route was
definitely the way to go. They're probably bumbling about
both literally and figuratively. Oh, Adam really seems like
he's struggling in his Zorb. Whoa! Adam, how was your Zorb? I Zorbed the heck outta that! Yeah! Let's go. I was totally
Zorbing in there. Let's get out of here. Alright, let's keep going.
Let's go make cheese! Make cheese in front of the
largest cheese factory. At the Fonterra cheese factory, the largest cheese factory
in the southern hemisphere, make at least one
marble's worth of cheese. So it turns out apparently
making cheese is easier than I would've thought. We only need milk and
vinegar to make a kind of homemade cottage cheese. So the broad steps are
to boil some milk, and then once it's hot,
adding vinegar to it. And that should straight away
start this kind of reaction of the curd separating
from the whey. Alright, here's a gas station. Milk and vinegar. Oh, malted vinegar.
Yeah. Oh yeah. Perfect. Thank you.
Thank you. Okay. Okay, extremely quick Zorb
as promised. I loved the Zorb! The Zorb was awesome! We had a great time Zorbin'. I can't believe that they
decided instead of Zorbing... that they were gonna have to
knit and make cheese. Okay, I think I see it.
Oh, I see it. I see it on the horizon.
Big white building. Alright, let's hope that they
have a cheese-making zone. Yeah, let's just pull off here.
This is the perfect spot here. Yeah, this is
actually made for us. And this is the
cheese-making spot. This seems almost like
it's a designated cheese— It is the designated
cheese-making spot. Alright, this should be good to go. Alright, that is on. So I don't think we
should put too much. I actually worked out that
if you got 50 mL of milk, it would be two mLs of Okay, I have no idea
what 50 mL is. I'm gonna just cover
the bottom, basically. Yeah, it should... So, I turn— Once it starts
boiling, I turn it off, right? And then, pour it in
and then start stirring. Yes. It's almost boiling. It doesn't have
to be fully boiled. Hey, ready? You think that? Yeah. So our next challenge
is actually sort of a fun little joke about how the other
route involves making cheese. Eat cheese at a
relaxing hot spring. The team must visit and spend
20 minutes in Kerosene Creek, where both team members must
eat a piece of cheese and say, ""Gee, I sure am glad I'm
not making cheese right now."" Okay, we're having a little
bit of trouble finding cheese, 'cause this city is laid out
in a really confusing way. Yeah, we were on the wrong
side of the highway, but there's a median, and then
we tried to get to the other side, and then we couldn't,
and it was a whole mess. Oh, it's already curdling.
You see that? Oh, that's perfect. Yeah, see? It's perfect.
Oh man, that was so easy. I mean, we definitely
have a marble worth of it. And that's what it was about. See that? That's cheese! There, just have a little bite. Cut to Toby suffering
from food poisoning. Yeah, no, it's actually legit. Alright. Let's send it! That was really quick. I think way quicker than
this challenge was expected to be. Sam and Toby are
on the move once again. Really? Which means that they
made cheese pretty quickly. I thought that would
be almost impossible. Turns out it's really
easy to make cheese. That's kinda cool. Not cool for us though. It's fine. We need to relax and
enjoy Kerosene Creek. (sigh) Okay, Ben and Adam seemingly
are just leaving Rotorua, which is basically where
the Zorb track is. So they're on their way
to that springs that they have to
chill in for a while. So we're basically
neck and neck in terms of how far,
in terms of latitude. Okay.
But they have to stop. So hopefully that
buys us enough time to do the Huka Falls challenge. We've done both of
our challenges on this one. Yeah. Here we are. The two cheese selection. Well that's as many—
No, it's a three— Three cheese selection. Great. That's as many cheeses
as we need, certainly. Alright. Kerosene Creek. Okay, here we are... at Kerosene Creek. Here we go. It's actually
very lovely here. Oh (bleep) Oh... that rocked. Well, I sure am glad that
I'm not making cheese. Well, I sure am glad that
I'm not making cheese even though apparently that
would be (bleep) way faster. I sure am glad that
I am not having to chill at the thermal wonderland. That'd be a
very stressful chill. It's time for a really special
edition of The Snack Zone. No, I'm very stressed out
and I don't like this cheese. Yeah. There's no one here. There's literally
no one (bleep) here. And this is like
a lovely natural bath. If I lived here, I would
be here every day. What gives? Okay, I'm gonna check
where Adam and Ben are, but first, it's time to be real! I think we're
nearly done here. Yeah. In Kerosene Creek. They're gonna
beat us to Huka Falls. We could potentially buy a curse. We do wanna slow them down
as much as we possibly can. Yeah. 'Cause we... really want to
get on the 1 pm ferry. But even more,
we want to stop them from getting on the 1 pm ferry.
Yeah. 'Cause if both teams miss it,
then we're just both on the 3:45. And it's still neck
and neck and we could still pull out a victory. Yeah. So remember that ferry
we're talking about before? We're getting closer to it. Quick reminder,
the team that completes the Wellington challenge first
will earn a ticket on the 1 pm ferry tomorrow. The next team will have to
wait until 3:45. But, and this is important,
if neither team makes it in time to get on that 1 pm ferry,
both teams will be on the 3:45. Because they're behind, Ben and Adam's strategy
is pretty simple. They don't need to
make the ferry. They just need to
make sure we miss it. Which means slowing us down
any way they can. Yeah, I mean I just can't
think of that many curses that are gonna slow them
down at Huka Falls. That's true. Most of them involve
slowing down your movement, and you just don't
have to move that much. I think that we should just
make an attempt for the Nerf. We should attempt to Nerf them. At Huka Falls. Yeah, we'll put
on our disguises. We'll see how well
that could work. Maybe they'll be gone by then. Yeah. But then we can just catch
them at the next intersection. Alright, that is
20 incredible minutes of relaxing in Kerosene Creek. And now we have to very
frantically get our stuff and go 'cause we are behind again. Alright, Ben. I think it's disguise
time, my friend. Time to get our disguises. Hello. I for one am excited to utilize my androgynous features. Okay, we gotta run. Next stop, Huka Falls. I'm optimistic, but we gotta
make sure I think we're ahead and have enough time
without worrying about Nerf, but only if we are
efficient with our time. I've got gun fever, Adam. Yeah. I want to shoot Sam so bad. We're out here really
Bonnie and Clydeing. We're embracing our,
you know, feminine wiles. Absolutely. And... Yeah, I am gonna
shoot Sam in the eyeball. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Well, if you want to
see if these guys catch up to us at Huka Falls... you can find out
next Wednesday, or... if you're a Nebula
subscriber, right now. That's because every
single episode of Jet Lag@12 we post one week early
and without ads on Nebula. And we're even doing more
than that this season with what's called The Layover. Now live on the podcast, I'm going to attempt
the milk pong challenge. I have red solo cups, and I have ping pong balls. Okay.
Here we go. Okay, we ready? He's taking his first shot. There it goes. It was really close.
Oh, it hit the top of the cup. I think what led to the mess up was just literally the same thing
that happened in Tag Across Europe of just being overly
trusting in the tracker. I love cheese that's
optimized for speed. That's a quality
I look for in my cheese. Yeah. The fastest. In my YouTube profile picture, I'm wearing a knitted
Klein bottle hat, and there's a video
on my YouTube channel of me knitting that hat. But it's from five
or six years ago. Guys gotta up your
oppo research game. We got punished for
not being huge Toby heads. So if that sounds interesting, if you have a ton of free time
and you want to hear us break down in
excruciating detail all of the ways that Adam and I
could have pulled out Auckland because it was that close. They really like
to make that point. It was that close! It was that close. I would even say
it was that close. We do this podcast
every week with Toby. And we break down the episodes
and we answer your questions. And you can listen to that
podcast exclusively on Nebula. Nebula, you've definitely
heard us talk about Nebula before. It's a creator-owned and
creator-founded streaming service that's designed to be the
best home for our content. And it's definitely the
best place to watch Jet Lag, because of course,
one week early episodes, you get access to the podcast. You also get access
to the aftershows of all of the other
seasons that we've done. You also get access
to Crime Spree, which is an entire
season of Jet Lag that is exclusive to Nebula. And if you watch any
of these creators who I'm gonna pop up
on the screen now, they're popping up on the screen. They all make things for Nebula. A lot of them have
exclusive content on Nebula. A lot of them are
doing episodes early, just like Jet Lag does,
on Nebula. And also when you
subscribe to Nebula, you're helping to
support the show. And how does that work? It's actually not just
a broad concept. It's actually that
every single month, if you use our link,
but only our link, nebula.tv/jetlag
You have to use our link. You gotta use our link,
but if you use our link, we get a portion of
your subscription fee for as long as you
stay subscribed. So that's predictable,
recurring monthly revenue, which is the best type of revenue. And what do we do
with that revenue? We reinvest in the show.

and everything. I mean, you can already
see the difference between this season
and season one. Big difference. And we want to just keep
pushing that bigger and bigger. So that's why we're
so appreciative of our Nebula subscribers. They really do make
this show work, and they also make
this show better. So yeah, head to our link, nebula.tv/jetlag to sign up. And you'll actually get $20 off an annual subscription

of our race across New Zealand. Last episode,
my partner Toby and I went from being about
50 minutes behind to around 30 minutes ahead, largely thanks to our decision
to take the longer western route. Despite its 192 minute driving time — 70 minutes longer than
the eastern route – its three relatively
simple challenges didn't slow us down too much, while Ben and Adam
on the eastern route spent over two hours completing their first three challenges,
with two still left to go. Being behind is
especially bad right now, because we're approaching Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand,
which all paths go through. The team to complete
the Auckland challenge will earn a huge reward and have their pick of the
many paths headed south. All of which is to say, Ben and Adam are
desperate to catch up by blazing through their
remaining challenges. The first of which is
attempting to find a clock at Claphams Clock Museum that's telling the right
time within 15 minutes. The only problem is... the museum's closed. Oh god, that is not good. That is not good. (bleep) ♪ Back on the road again ♪ I need to learn the
rest of that song. That's the only lyric I know. Toby, I have some delightful news. Mhm? I did the math. I know that's your
thing, but I did it. It is currently the closure time
of the Clapham Clock Museum. So it seems like they're
gonna have to veto. Can we— we can
see clocks through... Okay. ...this glass. Alright, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, we'll— yeah, yeah. Look through here. No, no, no. Oh, wait, wait.
Ben, Ben, Ben. What time is it? That one says 5:56. It's 6:11. That's within 15 minutes! That's exactly within
15 minutes, look! Which one?
Show it, show it. The grandfather clock there. Do you see that? On the left. Okay, I'm gonna zoom in for you. You see that? 5:57. It's 6:11.
That counts, right? That has to count. That counts—
We found the clock. That's the clock. The museum did not
have to be open. It didn't— it never said
that it had to be open. So let's get outta here. Okay, let's go,
let's go, let's go! Well, that... We really averted disaster there. Our next location
is the Waipu Caves. And our challenge is... Find a glowworm at Waipu Caves. I'm so excited for this. Thank you.
This is, in many ways, this is why I wanted
to take the east route. I wanna see a glowworm.
I wanted to see the glowworm. We just have to find
one glowworm. Look at that little guy running across.
Is that a roadrunner? No, he's just a little guy. Okay, Waipu Caves entrance. Let's do it.
Alright. Okay, so just be real careful. Oh man, it's
really just a cave. It's legit just a cave. Let's get our lights going. Oh, this is so scary. What's the hell? This is crazy! This is an insane thing. Oh my god. (softly) We gotta find glowworms. (hushed) Yeah, we gotta find
glowworms. We should go... I'm gonna eat so
many (bleep) glowworms. Don't eat glowworms.
Don't eat glowworms. We're gonna go left, Ben.
Left, left. This way? Left, that way is left. (whispering) This feels insane.
What's happening? This should be so illegal. Okay, now that
we're back here... let's try turning our lights off and seeing if we can
see a glowworm. Okay. (gasp) Oh my god. Can you see them? I dunno if they're
showing up on the camera. Here, I'm gonna take some long
exposure pictures of them. Oh my— They're so pretty. It looks like a night sky. I would describe that in you know, a very serious way as being quite magical. Okay, Toby, I just
realized something magical. We're actually safely ahead. That's good, because
you know what, Sam? I think I've done the thing. What is the thing?
A terrible thing. Which is, you know when
you kind of close your door, but you don't really close
your door and it's kind of... Oh yeah, well, I've
done that twice today. I'm looking for the first
opportunity to close the door. Well— And that makes me feel
a little bit less stressed. Best I can tell, you have
the time to close your door. That's great news, Sam. That's great news.
Wow, so that makes— Wow, so we just... That western route,
that was... That was the right call. That was easily the right call. Look, I know we're in a hurry. Let's just go a little
further down. Just keep going. Let's just really get in here. (whispering) Oh, you can
see 'em on the video now. Oh, they're so (bleep) blue. It's incredible. Oh my gosh. I really want to know
what they'll taste like. Don't eat them.
You can't eat them, Ben. I'd really like to eat one. Okay... We gotta go.
Okay. We've seen glowworms.
This was awesome. We've already spent
extra time in here, just 'cause they're so cool.
We do have to go. They're so cool.
They're so cool. Right. That was maybe the coolest
thing we've ever done. Yeah, that's amazing. I mean, after being so
far behind this morning, and now we're... I'm gonna guess we're gonna
be a full 30 minutes ahead. I would not be surprised
if we get a curse soon. I'm sure Ben and Adam
are thinking about that. Get this...
Oh yeah, it's closed. Nice. That rocked. So let's...
A lot. keep going, I guess.
Let's keep going. Okay, I think that we
should buy a curse. I agree.
Just put it in our deck. See if it's gonna be
useful in the future. Just know what we
have, don't you think? I agree. Let's do it. We'll do it
while we're driving though. Well, let's get going. Toby, we are on
the one road that is a choke point
before Auckland. We do have a safe margin, but I wonder if we,
while we have the opportunity, maybe want to draw a roadblock and see if it'd be a
good one to put down. To be ahead on a
choke point is priceless. We don't have long. Let's get a
roadblock if we can. Alright, let me
shuffle the deck. We're gonna shuffle the curses. Okay, I can't really shuffle... when filming well. Let's take a look.
Let's see what we get. Destroy one ring. Destroy one ring. Find a ring and destroy it. You may find any type of ring, but it must be
indisputably a ring. That's reasonably hard.
Okay, let me look— Let me look at what the furthest
place from a shop would be. Are you ready? I'm ready. Oh, it's a good one. For the next three McDonald's that are visible from the roadway,
you must stop there, and each team member
must eat something. Oh, nice! That's a good one. I think that's a
relatively good roadblock. The best I can tell if we put
it right before Wellsford... Think it seems like the
only shops that exist are gonna be closed by
the time they get there. This one, okay. So get ready to throw it.
Three... Right... right... now.
two... one... That's a good one. It really slows 'em down. (bleep), they
just roadblocked us! Okay, well... the powerups are in use now. (forced laugh) Alright. It's very
nearly rugby time. Kick a rugby ball through the
uprights at Centennial Park from a distance of at
least 49 feet or 15 meters. Team members must
alternate attempts. Wellsford Rugby Club. Okay, I don't see the things. That's what I was worried about. Yeah, so bizarrely,
this field does not have posts. Okay, so we need to
measure this out. We've agreed with Ben and Adam. We're just gonna
visualize it against this. Okay, 10 feet is
just above these things. Put down my wallet as right.
So 50 feet back. We have to kick it
between wallet and post. Above—
Just above those little things. Yeah, does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. And hopefully we can
do a virtual overlay thing. Ready? Yeah.
This is gonna be it. I know it. Oh, I need more height, okay. That's alright. Okay. Nope. Oh! Ah, damnit. Oh! (grunting) Ah, damnit! Are they still
at Centennial Park? Yes. Good. I mean, look, we're only
20 minutes behind them. I know, but this roadblock... It just depends on how
good of a roadblock it is. Alright. This is the spot.
Okay. We have arrived at the roadblock. Destroy one ring.
Find a ring and destroy it. You may destroy any type of ring, but it must be
indisputably a ring. This I think we can do. I'm thinking that the
best way to do this is to go to absolutely any
convenience store or gas station. Yeah, like a gummy ring.
And get a gummy ring. I mean, just head
back that way, right, and just go to the
first thing we see. Do we need to start thinking
about other options? No! Yeah, it's a 45 minute penalty. We can definitely
do it in 45 minutes. I don't necessarily agree
we can do it in 45 minutes. I don't know, we've
gotten relatively close. I'll say that I don't think
I can do it in 45 minutes, Sam. This is about
your confidence now. I mean, I've gotten, not far. I've gotten the height. Yep. Should we watch
a YouTube video? So he's hitting it before. Let's try that, 'cause
this is a beginner— Dropping it straight
onto the front, okay. Yeah, 'cause this
is a beginner's one. Let's try it.
So maybe that'll help. 'Cause he seems to hit it like that. See, see?
That was amazing. Wait, is that— That was in!
That was amazing. That was in! Thank you, YouTube! I love you, YouTube! Oh man, that was looking
bleak for a second. What in tarnation? Hey, wait, we need to quickly figure
out which route we're taking. So at the next intersection, there's a choice of
two routes to Auckland. They're approximately
the same length, but the east route takes
you through Silverdale, where you have to have 30 minutes
of fun at the Megazone arcade. Whereas the west route takes
you through Helensville, where you have to have 30 minutes of
fun at the Helensville Laundromat. Okay, so right now,
'cause the traffic, the west route is only—
is five minutes... It's five minutes slower. So I guess we should
still do the east. We should do the fast route,
'cause there's no advantage doing the west route
that I'm aware of. Okay, left. There it is up ahead.
Alright. That looks promising to me. These are ring-shaped. I mean, they're
called burger rings. This literally says rings. That is indisputable. We can even do a
snack review with them. Thank you. Okay. Easy peasy. Alright. Let's destroy a ring. Super quick Snack Zone
with Ben and Adam. We're gonna have burger rings. Here's a burger ring.
It's indisputably a ring. It's called a ring. I've just destroyed it.
You just destroyed it. Okay.
Oh, it's weird. (laughs) Okay.
I kinda like it though. They have left Wellsford, which is unfortunate,
which means... Finally done the drop kick. They must have
done the drop kick. We are now going to
follow directly behind them, knowing that they're going to
clear this Megazone challenge. And we can just pass
through without doing it. That way we'll be neck
and neck with them. I think we could even probably
get them with a Nerf gun. Ooh. They're following us. Hmm. They're following us? What that means is they're gonna try to shoot us. We need a Nerf bullet. Yeah. So a Nerf bullet costs 10. And the deal with it is that if we manage to shoot
and hit one of them, then they get delayed
for 30 minutes. 30 minute freeze. So we're gonna
spend 10 of our coins. We're gonna go ahead,
and we're gonna load this in here. So now we are armed and dangerous. We don't have a lot of options other than hoping they don't
manage to get us at the Megazone. Yeah.
Or that we get them first. Should we consider... We should consider a roadblock
if they're right behind us. Yeah. Shall we draw a thing? Oh, I really hope this is good. Perform a handstand unassisted for a total of one minute. You may string together
multiple attempts. Your teammate can help you
get into handstand position. Ugh, no, it's not good. It's handstand for a minute. Which is really tough to
predict how long that'll take. We have a good amount of coins.
We could pull another one. We could consider a curse card. But if we get lucky with a curse, that could really
help us in Auckland. If you feel confident
about a curse— Let's pull a curse.
Okay. Let's see. Fingers crossed. That's all the coins. During your next challenge, you may only walk forward
after rolling a die. Each time you roll a die, you may take the
same number of steps as the number you roll. Oh, that is a really good one. I like it. Okay, every—
Every time they walk. They're gonna be larking
around Auckland, up mountains. Yeah, that is actually
as good as it can get. OP, as they say. Oh dear. So we are stuck in
horrible, horrible traffic. One thing I'll say is that
this sort of thing can't happen during a normal board game. That is so true. This almost never
happens during Monopoly. Ugh. Yeah, let's find a good
spot to drop the handstand one. Alright, Ben and Adam. I hope you have fun handstanding. Throw it! It's hilly and stuff. That's gonna be a fun
handstand spot for them. Sam has thrown down
yet another roadblock. Yeah. We're not gonna get
to the roadblock tonight. I think it's too far. Okay. (yawn) This is the spot. Tomorrow at 8 am,
we will be right here. Oh, that's it.
That was our spot. We will see you tomorrow morning. Now it's time for the
first rest period. If you hadn't noticed, everything you've seen so far
in the first three episodes has happened on day one. Every night between
9 pm and 8 am, the game pauses for 11 hours, so the players can find a hotel, take an unreasonably long shower,
and get some sleep. Now, here's day two. Here we are. Welcome back... to day two. It is 8 am. It's eight.
Okay. It's eight, we're good.
Let's go, okay. I checked the timing. Ben and Adam are
23 minutes behind. All of that traffic
that we had last night, it's dissipated, so a lot
of our margin is gone. Hopefully that handstand roadblock will buy us seven minutes of margin. Okay, here's the roadblock. Adam, are you ready to find
out what our roadblock is? I'm ready, I'm worried. The handstand one. Oh, oh, we can do this. We can do this quickly.
Okay, we gotta hurry. Do this as fast as possible.
For a total of one minute. We're blocking these
people's driveway, but we're gonna hope
that they're chill. Okay, come on, come on,
come on, come on! If we hurry, then we can maybe
still catch them at the Megazone! There it is. Megazone. It's not very mega. Touch the building.
Start our time. Alright, timer started. Let's start having fun. Alright, here we go. So it's probably only gonna
be a few seconds at a time. Okay, I think that's
maybe one second. That was one second. That was one second.
(guffaws) We're at two seconds. 20 questions.
Do you have a person? No, no, we're not
starting 20 questions. We're starting with
our CookieTimes. So starting up, we have... Cookie Bake by CookieTime. A classic Kiwi snack. Would you like to
explain anything more? I don't know, CookieTime,
it's a classic Kiwi thing. You want a treat?
You can have a CookieTime. I'm enjoying this. I would even say I'm having fun. You wanna play 20 questions? Have you thought of anyone? Yeah, I've thought of someone. Okay. Is this person a man? No.
Is this person a woman? Yes. Is this person American? No. Is this person
from New Zealand? Yes. Is it Jacinda Ardern? Yes. (giggles)
Okay, well there we go. Speaking of Ben and Adam, it seems like they're
at our roadblock. Oh, our handstand? I think so. But think they've just got there, so we gotta track how
long that takes them. That's gonna be crucial. Six. Okay. Whoa! Oh! Here, let's move over here. We got it. Alright. Let's go.
Let's go. They seem to have just
completed the roadblock. Right, it didn't
take them too long. Yeah. I mean,
we'll be fine for here. Auckland's gonna be tricky. I mean, we knocked
that out in 1:15. Yeah, not bad. We're not gonna be able to
catch them at the Megazone though. Let's just curse 'em now. —Cursed.
Oh no, I just got a text. Oh, no.
We're getting a curse. No, I just said they would be. I cursed myself. For the next three McDonald's
that are visible from the roadway, you must stop there, and each team member
must eat something. They're trying to slow us
down getting to Auckland. So that's... not awesome. It's okay. That's alright.
I think it's fine. We'll get some breakfast. Alright.
Anyway, we're still having fun, Sam. Okay, they just said,
""completed Megazone."" (bleep) Okay.
I'm literally... a minute from where I would
turn off to go to the Megazone. Oh my god. They're way
closer than I thought they were. So we've only just
entered the highway... a few minutes
before these guys, so... Mhm. Dang, they're gonna
get us at McDonald's. Two minutes behind 'em. (groan) The next three McDonald's that they see, they gotta stop,
they gotta eat something. And we'll be able
to fact check them, 'cause we'll be looking for it.
We're going the same way they are. So if we see a McDonald's,
they better be stopping at it. Hopefully...
before we get to Auckland... we will be able to pass them. Then if we pass them, we
could throw it down roadblocks. We can throw roadblocks. So I'm hoping we can pass them
after the next McDonald's. Oh my god. They're right
behind us on the motorway. They're— Why are they
moving faster than us? I saw the corner of a little red— Oh my god, they're coming.
They're coming on the left. They're gonna talk about
how the zipper merge is ethical. Zipper merge, baby.
We did a video about it. See, right there. There is a McDonald's
that will be visible on the right coming up here. Yeah, you can, you can see it.
It's right there. You can?
Yeah. Ahahaha! Oh, that is clearly visible.
Look at that. Yeah.
Show them. I showed them. Okay. That is clearly
visible from the road. They have to go there
and order something, which means that we
have now taken the lead. Here we are.
This is the McDonald's. Maccas! (indistinct) Hey, just two hash browns, please. That all for today? Yeah, that's it. Thank you.
Thank you. This is good. McDonald's curse, baby! It's a good curse. One of the best ones, really. Oh, they're on the
Harbour Bridge right now. Okay. So they're just crossing
over this harbour in front of us. Should we give 'em the news? Let's give them the news. I don't think
they're gonna like this. Shuffling our roadblocks, and then we're gonna just pull one. Maybe we use it,
maybe we don't, but... We'll see, good to have.
Again, the more... You know, if we can slow them
down just another 10 minutes... Yeah, it'd be huge for us.
Huge. Okay. Okay. Oh, okay,
they've just cursed us. (bleep) Really? What's the curse? Uh-oh. What is it? During your next challenge, you may only walk forward
after rolling a die. That's gonna slow us down. Nooo... No, no, no, no, okay.
That's gonna slow us down. Nyaaagh! The reason Adam's so
upset is because this is the Auckland Challenge: Destroy five rings
at five volcanoes. Acquire five rings of any kind. Starting at the Sky Tower, both team members must go to the top of five different volcanoes and destroy a ring. You must include at
least one volcano from three different basalts. Creativity is encouraged
in ring acquisition. Anything that could reasonably
be considered a ring counts. Look—
We're (bleep)-ed! We still have—
We are absolutely (bleep) Still ahead. Most of these, we don't
have to walk very far. No, I know. Some of them
we don't have to walk— And we can roll
the dice really quickly. We need to have our
Nerf gun ready to go. Oh god, they're probably
gonna be able to shoot us. Here we go. Can we talk about
a self-defence bullet? I think we, yeah, I mean,
probably should get one, yeah. I think we
should just buy one. We've got 10 coins, right? Yeah, and now's the time
we'll want it on hand, yeah. I wanna buy one. Get to load up... one of these. This is parking here
for this shopping center. This seems fine. Alright, we're starting
with the dice now. One. Three. We're so (bleep)-ed. So with the gun, you
pull this back, right, to load? Yeah, so we should
have it cocked basically. I need to put the
camera down for this. Okay.
You wanna get this? Just properly
loaded the bullet. Okay, parking.
Coming into the car park. Alright, ready?
Ready to rumble? We don't want 'em
to see I'm strapped. Americans. This is the Sky Tower. So we can go to that
convenience store over there. Two. Oh my gosh. Two. Five. Six. Four, five, six. Or— oh, burger rings. I think it's just gonna
have to be burger rings. Burger rings. I mean,
burger rings are rings. Okay. One, two, three, four.
Gonna load this. One, two, three, four.
(laughs) We're playing a little
game with our friends here. One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four. One, two. Okay, here's— No, here's what I
think we should do. I think we should go
hide at the Sky Tower and try to shoot them. Because we know they
have to go there, and that's our only shot at winning. What do you think?
Should we go after them or... Okay. Yes? Let's at least see—
Okay, but you have to shoot. Let's at least see
if we can spot them. I think they're across the street. I think they probably
already are buying stuff. Let's tap the Sky Tower
to start the challenge. So we just rolled a six. We need to use our six steps. Try to get them. And he's close. I mean, he's right around
the corner of the block. Oh, there he is.
There he is. You see him?
There he is. Yeah, I see him. This is our chance.
This is our chance. There, we've started. Yeah! Ahahahaaa! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Because I don't think they're
gonna complete this in 30 minutes. We should hunt them down. We're biking on a highway. Just stay to the left! There he is! There he is! That's them! Why are they going that way? Oh, it's moist! Okay, let's go.
There's a bit of cheese! We are at the
top of a volcano. I feel like I'm gonna throw up. I don't know if it's the stress
or all the burger rings. Yeah. Probably both. All that and more
next week on Jet Lag! Unless of course you're
a Nebula subscriber, because every single
episode of Jet Lag is up one week early on Nebula. And next episode, next episode,
I don't even know. I mean, it's one of those episodes where I think we were
genuinely worried. Because there's one
moment in particular that is just so unbelievable that we don't even know how
we're gonna convince y'all that it's not scripted. It's 100 percent not,
but it's... like... I remember that was our
primary concern after it happened. I don't know how. But next episode
really is something, and I can't wait
for y'all to see it. And of course, but you
could see it right now if you head over to Nebula. Because again, we put every single
episode there one week early in appreciation of the fact that
our Nebula subscribers, they basically fund this show. They don't ""basically"" fund this show. No, they literally do.
They literally fund the show. Literally all the
revenue for this show is from Nebula subscribers. But there's even more than
just next episode up early. Like, for example... Our Nebula exclusive
companion podcast, The Layover where every week we get together, we break down the episode—
With Toby. With Toby.
With Toby. Answering y'all's questions. We break down the episode.
We answer your questions. We get into the strategy,
the nitty gritty. So if you're wondering about
anything with this last episode, and there's a lot to break down. You can go listen to our Nebula
exclusive companion podcast. And, again, keep in mind,
that's Nebula exclusive. That is not a
one week early thing. You can only get that if
you're subscribed to Nebula. And Nebula has so much
more than just our podcast. There's a ton of Originals
from other creators. We've made a bunch of Originals, that I imagine will pop up now. Brian and Joseph,
former Jet Lag guests, both have original
series on Nebula. There are Nebula First videos, where creators put
their videos up early exclusively on Nebula. And most importantly,
when you subscribe to Nebula, you're supporting the show. The only way that this
show is able to exist is because of our
Nebula subscribers. We actually get a portion
of your subscriptions every single month for the entire time that you
are subscribed to Nebula. But only if you

back to episode two of our race across New Zealand. We're racing from here to here,
and along the way, we've turned the
country's highway system into one giant board game. There are many different
paths to the bottom, but each one is blocked
by different challenges. Each challenge rewards a
certain amount of coins, which can be spent to
sabotage the other team. Right now, the teams have split up. After starting behind, Ben and Adam just took the lead on the more reliable western route, because Toby and I took our chances on the luck-based eastern route, and had to veto our last challenge. That means we can't
make any progress for the next 60 minutes. (nervous giggle) We'll be fine. Maybe. I believe—
I know theoretically that we have so much game in front of us,
and they can have bad luck too. And, over the length of the game,
should have bad luck too. I just hate it,
'cause it seems like... It's always behind. We have a lot of
snacks in this car. We bought all
New Zealand snacks. So we're gonna do
a little snack review. This is a show
within a show called ""Snack Boyz"" with a Z. We might work on that. Our first snack is Rashuns, with this fun penguin on it. Oh, these smell bad. What's their flavor
profile supposedly? ""Cheesy bacon attack."" Oh, I hate that. That is certainly a
cheesy bacon attack. Yeah, I do feel attacked. We have arrived in Ōkaihau. Alright, so... Tunnel's just up there. There it is. Sing The Ōkaihau Express
in the Ōkaihau Rail Tunnel. Ōkaihau used to be the northernmost
rail terminus in New Zealand. Both team members must
memorize and sing ""The Ōkaihau Express""
uninterrupted while standing in the
Ōkaihau rail tunnel. If you make any mistakes,
you must start from the beginning. You may not begin
memorizing until you arrive. This is a cool shot. It's like in a music video, which this kind of is. Sick.
Okay, so: It starts out in Otiria, the smallest train— Starts out from Otiria.
From, okay. 'Cause we have to
get every word right. Yeah. We cannot get
a single word wrong. An engine and a guardsvan. What is that?
I don't know. Oh, here we go, finally.
Here we go, we're off. Okay. What's the song? ♪ Back on the road again ♪ (hums) You know that song? With our veto period up, Toby and I are headed
to our next challenge. Win the lottery in Kaeo. Roll a die. Buy that number of instant
Kiwi scratchie tickets. If you win any amount of money
on any of your scratch-offs, you complete the challenge
and unlock the shortcut. If you fail, you cannot
retry this challenge, and you'll be forced to
go around the long way. I've done some studying
of the scratch-it tickets that may be available to us.
Okay. Because the odds of each
of them are published online. Oh, and they're different odds. And I've found the three
best rated odds for scratchies. Alright, we're getting close. Welcome to Kae– Kaeo—? Kaeo, I think. We're going to Four Square,
which is right there. Nice, okay. We don't have the dice. Dammit.
Sorry, I don't have the dice. Oh, no! We got so excited. Alright.
Alright, you give a good roll. Okay, that's good. Nice job.
Five, that's five. That's pretty good.
Good roll. If we don't make it
with five of them, we are actively unlucky. One of those the right ones?
Get Outdoors. Yep, that's one. Should we just
get three of those? We need— and this
one here, the lemons. Three and two. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Alright, we
just need to win any. Nothing yet. Oh. It has a bridge. Oh, this rocks. ♪ She's goin' round the bend ♪ ♪ goin' 10 miles an hour ♪ Oh, that doesn't
make any sense. ♪ —smelled of steak for— ♪

Smelled of– (bleep) Oh, I got a beach chair.
Oh, I think I got it. Think I got it.
Really? Yeah, look at that.
Beach chair, beach chair. Oh my god.
Right? Beach chair, beach chair,
ten dollars. Is that right?
Yeah. Match any winning
similar to any other. We've done it. Take it, take it. Go get your $10.
Go get your $10. No, we don't have time.
We'll do it later. Let's go! Nice job. That's great. We didn't even need the five. But our six million
is on the five, and I'm keeping the— Well, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, we're splitting. We're lucky. Yes, finally. ♪ Pippies in a sack ♪ ♪ Riding the— ♪
What the hell are pippies? ♪ But no-one knows the difference ♪ When they're
dripping from the rack. What does that mean?
Riding the— Okay, what the (bleep), okay. What?
Is that like dirty? No...
I hope not. Okay, so we now theoretically
know all of the words. You wanna just go for it? I think we
should go for it, okay? She... ♪ starts out from Otiria ♪

What? You've seen. (bleep) ♪ Back on the road again ♪ ♪ Something, something,

intersection after the falls is actually pretty
close after the falls. So I think we wanna
start kind of discussing what the plan is, right? What's the plan, Toby? Should we find out where
Ben and Adam are now? Oh, yes, let's have a look. Because it could be very much
decided by which route they go on. And they're probably
in front of us by now. Yes, I wonder if they've
already done that junction. They haven't got to
the junction yet. They are just before the junction. That is good. They are still in Ōkaihau. Yeah, we're not as—
I think they're at the tunnel. I think they're actually at the
tunnel singing the song right now. Well, hopefully they're having
a really hard time memorizing. Oh, it's a (bleep) nightmare. Okay, here, let's
just give it a go. I think we've got it. ♪ She starts out from Otiria ♪

how our luck currently is, you should scratch the
rest of the scratchies off. If we get the grand prize, we will share the price of
our private jet to Fiji. Oh yeah. I'm gonna enjoy telling
Ben and Adam about that. Hope you guys are having

Yes! Oh my god! Let's go, let's get
the (bleep) outta here! (bleep) hell, we gotta go! Ohh! That took so long! Oh my god! Alright, here we go. Unfortunately, we don't
have time for a full analysis of all the best things here,
because maps are not working. Reception's not working, but... We're gonna have to... We're in a rush. Because we were
in such a rush then, we'll explain now. The next decision
point is a big one. There are two routes. The eastern route is shorter, an estimated 122 minutes, compared to the western
route's 192 minutes. But making up for the
longer driving time is the fact that the western route only has three relatively
safe challenges, like visiting a tree. While the eastern route
has five challenges, several of which are
time consuming or risky. Most notably: the cream
trip at the Bay of Islands, where teams will have to find a way
to travel between three islands. So once again, the decision comes down to how
much risk teams want to take on. I think I would lean
towards the western route, 'cause it seems lower risk. For what it's worth, I suspect Ben and Adam are
gonna take the eastern route. Just because every
time I talk to them... Yeah.
Leading up to this trip, they tell me how excited they
are to go to the Bay of Islands, which is on the eastern route. We are going... to the Bay of Islands. Going to the Bay of Islands. I think it's gonna be
very beautiful there. Yeah.
I hope. I mean, it supposedly has the second bluest
sky in the world. Yeah, that's sick. I don't really
know what that means, but it sounds cool. It does sound really cool. The east route is so cool. I'm really excited for some
of the stuff we're gonna do. It'll be interesting
to see whether Sam and Toby Whether they follow behind us.
decide to follow behind. If I were them, I
would follow behind us. We've figured
out that Ben and Adam are going east towards
the Bay of Islands. Okay. Personally, I think it's unlikely
that we get to the Bay of Islands and complete that
challenge before them, especially given that they might drop some roadblocks and stuff.
Yeah. The thing about the west route is those challenges are
very predictable, I think, and they're very straightforward. I've got a little bit of trauma
from the sand on the beach, and I'm just wanting
to do challenges that I know 100 percent we can achieve.
Yep. Yep. I don't wanna
get to the kayak shop, they're not open. Or all the kayaks are sold out.
They're not available. Yeah, it's too windy,
it's too choppy. I don't wanna know about it. I wanna go to a tree that's
been there for 500 years, and is still gonna be
there when we arrive. Yes, agreed. Let's lock it in. Alright.
West route! So it seems like they've taken
the other way, the west route. Really? Yeah. Huh. So they're not
following behind us, which is bold. I mean... Okay, okay. I think there's a really
good chance we're gonna beat 'em to Auckland now. Okay, we are about 15 minutes
from the Bay of Islands, where the next challenge is. Complete a cream trip
at the Bay of Islands. ""Cream trip"" is the term for the
traditional transport of goods between islands at
the Bay of Islands. For this challenge, you have to transport
any kind of cream between any three islands. Both team members must
eat some of the cream while on each of the islands. So, yeah, we can
hopefully just hop in a kayak, get some cream, bring it to the islands, knock it out. Easy peasy.
Yeah. I mean, I don't know if
it's gonna be easy peasy. Well, okay, but
you know, it'll be fun. It'll be fun.
It'll be fun. Funny peasy.
Fun peasy. That doesn't quite have
the same ring to it. It's gonna be fun peasy. Boom. (squirt) Does work. What do you normally
do on road trips? Normally what I do on road trips is listen to the entire unabridged
discography of Lizzo. I was telling Sam yesterday I exclusively listen to
Eminem bardcore myself. Yeah. It took some explaining
what that was, but... Just medieval remixes. Medieval remixes of
pop songs I guess is the gist, right? Yeah, that's
my favorite genre. Okay. So we have
been assuming kayaks, but we just saw some
motorboats down by the wharf. We're gonna ask if
we're allowed to rent. Hey there, do you
do jet ski rentals? Yes, sir. [indistinct] We go on a tour. Oh, on a tour?
Yeah. Oh, okay, no thanks then. Alright, it's kayaks, buddy, sorry. Do you wanna play 20 questions? I don't know how
to play 20 questions. You just have
to ask questions as— I'm gonna think of a person. You have to ask questions,
yes or no questions, and you get 20 to figure
out who the person is. Okay. Are they a New Zealander? No. No, that'd have been too niche. Are they female? No. Are they a singer? No. Are they a sports star? In a way. It probably depends who you ask, whether or not it's a sport. Okay, so there's
an island there. There's an island there.
There's an island there. We need to get to all of them, and eat cream on them, I guess. Kayak's up there. I think we're gonna be fine. Yeah, so we want a double 45. Somebody in here? There's no one in here. I don't love that. Is there another kayak rental spot? That place. Is their sport a... card-based game? Yes. Is it... one— is it... one of the people
currently playing Jet Lag? Yes.
(giggles) So my final guess at
question number 20 is... is it Adam Chase? No! Oh no! It was Ben! Devastating. Well, there's no one here. So... Seemingly someone
was here earlier. I mean, they left
their glasses here. That guy's dragging kayaks. Oh, is that our guy? That looks like it might be our guy. Do you have kayaks? No. No? Yep, I do. Take the blue on the
left hand side there. Right, thank you. No problem. Alright. We're gonna stop
recording for a minute so that Ben can help me paddle. Yay. So we'll see you
closer to the first island. This one. Okay, bye. I can announce
that not only are Ben and Adam in Paihia
doing the cream trip, but their tracker is
no longer on the land. Oh no! They are, in fact,
in the ocean on their way to the first or the second or the
third of their islands. Whether they're in a kayak
or a jet ski, I'm not sure. A jet ski, that
would be quite something. That would make it easier. So I just realized
that we could have asked the guy with the jet ski tour if he could
take us to the island. He probably would've
taken us to the island. I think he probably would've. So we're doing it in
the good old fashioned way. We've arrived to the first island. Come here and
let me feed you cream. Be careful of your little feet. These little guys, I hate them. (squirt) Bwuh. (squirt) Yay. Yeah, that's not great. Alright, we are on route... To island number two. To island two. Okay.
It's that little one. Okay. I'm gonna be honest, Ben.
Before, when I was like, we can definitely do this in
30 minutes, maybe even 20, I think I was wrong about that. It seemed bold. It is harder
than I'd like it to be. It's getting pretty forested. Weaving through the forest, off to find
what I believe to be the largest known kauri
tree in New Zealand. Admire Tāne Mahuta. Tāne Mahuta is the world's
largest known living kauri tree, estimated to be between
1,250 to 2,500 years old. You must admire it for
at least five minutes. So it's gonna
be a real big tree. I'm looking forward to seeing it. Yeah, we gotta do our best
to not be obnoxious YouTubers, because this tree is considered
sacred in Māori tradition. So that's why the challenge is really just go look at
it and appreciate it, rather than, I don't know... Carve your name into it. That would be bad.
Really bad. It's very pretty. It's very different from what
we have been driving through. I made Ben get the camera, 'cause I have an awesome
bit that I'm gonna do. You ready for it?
I'm so excited. Bay of Islands... more like Bay of Water! Most of this is freaking water. That's so true. That's not even a joke. That's so true.
If it was the Bay of Islands, I feel like this
would be a lot easier. Oh (bleep) Okay. There's the island. We're getting closer. Oh! Alright, we gotta be quick while also not distressing
all of the tourists. We have to go clean our shoes. They have the kauri
dieback disease here, so they've got these stations for us to clean our shoes before going in, so we don't spread disease. Biosecurity is rad.
These are some healthy trees. Oh wait, that's it. Our five minutes starts now. Kind of amazing. Ohh. You excited to
eat some whipped cream? Oh, it's no. (squirt) Okay.
Right. That's island number two. We are off to
island number three. Look at that cool bird.
Look at that cool bird. It's got a big... Oh my god, that is a cool bird. Round beak. You're so good at
spotting cool birds, Ben. Thank you. I love— I actually mean that,
you genuinely are good at it. I love a cool bird. You're almost always
pointing out a cool bird. It looks like the Avatar tree. You know the tree
from Avatar? Yeah, yeah, I do. Must be based on it.
I wouldn't be surprised. Is that a penguin? No. We're almost at island three. Alright, Ben.
Alright. I really gotta say, I really don't
want more whipped cream right now. Yeah, I know.
I'll give you just a little bit. (squirt) Okay. (squirt) We've done it.
We've eaten cream. Challenge complete.
Make the thingy pop up. Ohh. Okay.
Ohh. Now we have to get back there. I'm very tired, very full of... Full of cream.
Cream, and my back hurts. Yeah. We're channeling some powers. We're channeling
good, good vibes. We're channeling some good
vibes for the rest of our journey. Yeah. Any last hot takes? I don't wanna make a hot take. I just wanna admire it. Alright. That's a hot take in and of itself. Oh, okay, Tāne Mahuta. Unfortunately...
It's time to go. Unfortunately, we must depart. Yep. That was, I'm glad we added the
time to admire in the rules. 'Cause that would've sucked to just
come up and look at it and wait. Yeah, almost as if we went
all the way to Rainbow Falls and then left in the
car park with a... Rainbow Falls
isn't the life giver. This is. New driver alert! And we're off. Sam and Toby are moving. So we gotta move. How long have
we been doing this? I have no idea. ♪ The ship we sail is a kayak ♪ ♪ It's a kayak that we rented here ♪ ♪ We love to sell our big kayak ♪ We're back! We're back. We've made it back to land. Ah! Oh Jesus.
Alright. Christ. And stop. Alright, well, I'd say
that took slightly longer than I would've hoped. Let's go. Okay, so I'm just gonna
look at where Ben and Adam are. Yeah, they've left
Paihia, but only barely. They've like just left. Oh, so they
finished the cream trip? They've finished
the cream trip, yeah. Okay, but it still took them
a decent time, I think. Yeah, in terms of geography, we've moved down the country. Yeah, we're a good bit
south of them now, yeah. We're off now... To the ""Hunterwassen""
Public Toilets. Use the Hundertwasser
Public Toilets. Not a lot more to explain. Okay, welcome back to... Snack Boyz! Oh, Snack Boyz. Do we want a new name? I don't know.
Snackin'. No, I think we need
to have the same name. With Ben and Adam. Well, 'cause I'm gonna
get the motion graphics team to make a special little... like logo and stuff for this. So I think we have to decide on one. The Ben and Adam Snacktacular. Welcome back to... The Snack Zone. Ooh, The Snack Zone. That's good. Today, we're gonna
be reviewing... Bluebird Thinly Cut potato chips. Adam, would you do the honors
of trying a potato chip? I'll tell you what, that
tastes like a potato chip for sure. Okay, we gotta hurry. We're running behind. And there they are. They got a weird, cool design. We just thought it would
be fun to put them on there. Why? I don't, you know. Yeah, I mean,
quit yelling at us. We're just trying to have fun. Here are the toilets. They look really weird. Alright, we gotta use 'em, Ben. Now the camera goes off. Ben, have you finished your use of
the ""Hunter Watson"" Public Toilets? (distant) Yes. Oh! You're out here, let's go. And now... we are headed to... Adrenalin Adventure Park. Oof. We're barely gonna make it in time. 2.8 miles— kilometers
to the turnoff. Okay. So... let me check the... Well, let me wait until we turn, and then I'll check the
rules for the challenge. Make a new friend at Kai Iwi Lakes. Snorkel in the waters of either
Lake Kai Iwi or Lake Tahoroa until you find a clearly visible,
living, non-human animal. Tell it your name. You must get it on camera. ♪ We have made it ♪ Let's hope that they
have bountiful... things. Animals, non-human animals. Many friends for us.
Yes. Okay. Man, this is a gorgeous lake. I don't know. Yeah, this is gonna be tough to find
fish with all these people around. Oh.
There is a cow in the way. You know, he's
just hanging out. Oh.
There you go. There you go. Welcome to Lake Edwin,
home of Adrenalin Adventure Park. Go extreme at
Adrenalin Adventure Park. Both team members must complete ten separate obstacles at
Adrenalin Adventure Park. Hi there. Can we still wrap
around for 10 or 15 minutes? Yeah, sure. Great. This is actually,
let's stick this out. Alright, here we go. I really can't emphasize enough that this is just on a farm. How you doing?
It's refreshing. It's lovely. Okay. You take the lead. I'm gonna
follow behind you, okay? Wow, truly barely completed it. Oh, Ben! Toby Cam is on. Just keep rolling, I guess. Alright. Best of luck. I'll see what I can do. Okay, come on, come on. Here we go, come on. Up, up, up! Here we go. I've completed it. You got it, buddy! Just hold on to something. Just making a game plan. I think the game plan
is just run straight down it. How many have we completed? One. (distant shrieking) Shut up. Just go fast. Go fast. Key is speed. Just run across it. Is that— You got
to the other end of it. Is that complete?
I clearly completed that. Okay. You got the other end. I'm saying that's complete. This is another one.
This is easier. So you just do this one. (wheezing) Just go fast, that's the key. Just go fast. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. Take a minute for setting yourself. Quality, quality. Great job, great job. Nailed it. Nailed it.
Look at that. Okay. Just spotted Toby running away. Hopefully that's good news. We've done it? I saw the
world's tiniest fish, and I hope it's on the GoPro. Is there any way to check? We can check. Okay. Okay.
And you introduced yourself? Introduced myself.
I said my name. He said his name. Everyone introduced themselves. I couldn't see nothing! The visibility was so poor that as soon as
I got in the water, I knew that I wouldn't
be able to see a fish, even if there was
one right underneath. Well, as long as you saw it. Great, okay. So that's
five we've both done. Alright, you got it. So just run and grab
onto the big pillar. You gotta kinda stretch
your way around it. I'm too small
for the big pillar. Gotta try the other big pillar. I think they're the same. But, I like the
feel of this one more. Okay, okay. Other pillar was a winner, great. You're doing so good.
You're doing so good. And I'm proud of you. I'm gonna go over. Oh, I think
that's a huge risk. Okay, over worked, great. Alright, ready to head? Did you make any
friends on or off water? Absolutely not. We should just write
a big decal on our thing. On our cars. ""Get outta the way.
We're in a race."" Jet Lag, yeah. This is for content! We gotta be
making the content. Gotta understand
the sanctity of content! So this will be nine. (bleep) hate it here. I know, I know.
You're doing so good. That's nine. No, no, no! (wheezing giggles) Just get up.
Just walk onto this thing. I'm so weak. Okay. Don't fall in. Okay, you did it, okay. Somehow they still seem
to be at the Adrenalin Park. They think it would take
20 minutes, that challenge. Well, I wonder if
they had to veto it. 'Cause that's the
only explanation for why they would still be there,
I can think of. Part of me just wants them
to had to veto something. This is looking.... Coming up buildouts.
promising. Yeah. Great job. Any concluding thoughts? We haven't
eaten any food today. We can't be climbing
that thing, right? So seemingly,
we are climbing that thing. Give your partner a genuine
compliment at Tokatoka Peak. In Māori stories, Tokatoka Peak is
to be summited with a loved one. In the spirits of platonic love, when you arrive at
the top of the peak, give your teammate a genuinely
thoughtful compliment. Alright, gotta clean up again. Alright, let's get to it. That seemed like it was one of
the worst experiences of your life. I threw up a lot of lake water. I swallowed a lot of lake water. Yeah, I don't understand
how you swallowed— I just, my mouth was open, and then I went in the lake, and I just took in
a lot of lake water. But now it's gone. It's getting steep. It's definitely a steep one. So sweaty. So sweaty and sandy
and et cetera. I see the light. Like we're nearly there. You see the light.
Yep. I see the light too. Nearly there. Where am I? This is gorgeous. Okay, well, we're still in a race, so we need genuine compliments. Sam, you are very patient. You've been patient with
me climbing up this hill. Oh, thank you. And on our kerfuffle
on the navigation. I appreciate it. And for that, thank you. No problem. Also, I have a gift for you. You have a gift for me? I found this on the way up. It's a berry.
Oh my gosh. Should I eat it?
It may not be poisonous, but that's up for you to decide. That's one. I would like to compliment
your YouTube prowess. Because I'm someone... Don't let Toby hear this. I hate math. Math is like my
least favorite thing. You didn't hear that, right? Nothing. Yeah. Despite what I just mentioned, Toby's channel is
so entertaining. And to take something
that you really don't like and make it genuinely
fun and entertaining and interesting to watch, that takes real skill. Thank you, Sam.
You're welcome, Toby. That's so nice of you. Should we get back to it? Yeah, fist bump.
Fist bump. We're... way behind now. Yeah. So we thought that they
hadn't done the hike yet, but they have done the hike. And we still have two
more challenges to do before we can get to the
next intersection point. Yeah. Hopefully quick ones, but... challenges nonetheless. So I'd say that
things aren't going great. No.
But... our next challenge is very fast. So we just need
to do it really quickly. And then the challenge after that, hopefully quickly as well. And we just need to gain
as much ground as we can. Somewhat soon, we should
start thinking about what happens when the roads converge again. And that's gonna be a
really crucial point. Because if
we're ahead of them, even by ten feet, we can start dropping
some powerups and stuff. Some roadblocks and stuff, which I think
would really help us. And really hurt them,
which is that's our goal, to hurt Ben and Adam. Now we are headed
to Clapham's Clock Museum. Find the time at Clapham's
National Clock Museum. At the museum, find a clock that is showing the
correct time to within 15 minutes. The clock must be on display— it may not be your own clock. This should be
really, really fast. Should be a breeze. This should take maybe
like 5 or 10 minutes, I think. And we also need it
to take 5 or 10 minutes. 'Cause we are behind now. Alright.
Okay. Let's look at those clocks. Clapham's National Clock Museum. No... No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay... Oh god, that is not good. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Ohh boy! That is not looking good, boys. But we're gonna have to wait
a whole week to find out. Unless, of course,
you're a Nebula subscriber. Because every single episode
is up one week early on Nebula, meaning episode three
of Jet Lag... up right now on Nebula. And that episode,
I really think... I mean, that's where it starts
to really heat up this season. It gets dramatic. But of course, you know,
forgetting about that for now, episode two, I'm sure you
have plenty of questions. So much happened.
And we have a brand new way that we're really excited about
answering all of your questions and explaining
everything that happened. It's our new podcast
called The Layover. But just for
listeners of the podcast, we right now are going to play a punk rock cover of
""The Ōkaihau Express"" that we got made for something
that we can't tell you about yet. Does Ben drive? No, I don't drive
it all this season. I technically have
a driver's license, but we would have to go
back to when I was 15. Oh wow.
Go back, go back, go ahead. I was in love
with my best friend. I remember after Ben
kept talking about how much lake water he swallowed,
which I really didn't understand, 'cause I'm like, swallowing
is a voluntary action. I just have an easier time swallowing lake water
than most folks. He's got one of
those lake water mouths. Yeah. And that's what
makes Ben special. Yeah, I must have been a bit
out of it when I got to the top, 'cause I was watching the episode, and I had no memory at all of basically what
we said at the top, or me giving you the berry. Oh, easy answer.

when we're in season, we get on a call with Toby, and we talk through everything
that happened in the episode. Basically after we
finish filming a season, we don't know what
the other team did. And so we always get together, and we have a
really fun discussion where we find out everything
the other team did and we ask
each other questions and we learn about their strategy. And we were like, what if instead
of doing that on our own time, we recorded it and
we made it a podcast? And that's basically
what The Layover is. But we also spend a lot of
time answering your questions. We've found that every episode, we get a ton of questions on
Reddit and Discord and Twitter. And we figured, why don't
we put all of the answers to those questions in one place? And that's what The Layover is, and we think that

of New Zealand. We're racing all the way
to the bottom. And to do it, we've turned
the country's entire highway system into a giant board game. But it's 8 am, so we
gotta go, go, go, go, go! Oh my god, this is for real! Alright, come on Ben.
We can do this. Okay, so we have to race
to our cars. But while we do that, we're gonna cut to a sequence
that explains all the rules. So here's how the game works. We're here. The first team to get here,
Lookout Point at the very bottom of New Zealand, wins. There are a number of
different routes to get there, and the teams will have to choose
their paths very carefully. The trouble is all of the paths
are blocked by challenges. Lots of them. In order to clear path to the finish, teams must complete these challenges, which will unlock the
next stretch of highway. Once the stretch of highway is unlocked, it's unlocked for everyone, by the way, not just for the team that cleared it, which means that while it
can be hard to get far ahead, it's often not that hard to catch up. But teams need to be careful, because as a reward for
completing a challenge, they'll earn coins which
they can spend on Powerups. Powerups they can use to
sabotage their opponents. We'll explain more about Powerups
and some other rules later on. But for now, let's get back to
a foot race between four nerds to see which team can get to their
car and get out of Cape Reinga first. So the road is really uphill. My weakness is running up hills. Let's try not to slow
them down too much. Oh, I'm very outta shape. And I'm wearing overalls. But finally...
Sam has a teammate... who's just as slow as me. Alright. This is our car for this season. His name is Dan. You can see it says so there. We gotta go... because we have to get
to the first challenge. Okay. Let's go. I'm gonna pick Toby up over there. I think Adam's doing the same for Ben. Okay. Toby! Toby! Here! I gotta get in on
the other side of the car! Go, go, go, go, go! Get in the car! Let's go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go! Oh, we've done it, Toby. Nice job. Okay, well they're breaking the law!
They're breaking the law! They're driving on the
right side of the road. Alright, suckers. See if you can catch up. Okay, so right now, we are on
the same path to start with. Because there's
only one highway up here. But the first challenge
is in about 20 minutes. We'll explain how that works in VO. Okay, this is the first challenge. The team to do it first
will claim its reward and clear the path for both teams. If no team is able to
complete the challenge, it may be cleared by vetoing in exchange for a time
penalty and no reward. Sandboard at the
Te Paki Sand Dunes. One team member must
successfully sandboard down a dune of at least 50 feet
in height without falling. Sam loves skiing. He's tried to tell me
many times that skiing will not give him an
advantage for snowboarding. Yeah, skiing's very
different than snowboarding, and this is different
than snowboarding. I think I should have an advantage,
but I don't want to overstate it. This is make and break
for the next junction. Yeah, for sure. And yeah, we really want to
be at that next one first, 'cause I think that
there's probably, I think, a clear best route. By the way, who are you? I'm Toby. I run the
YouTube channel Tibees, make math and science videos. I did grow up in New Zealand, went to school, went
to university here. But I haven't really
explored my own backyard, so this is really my
chance to do that. Oh, I see dunes up ahead. Oh, shoot. Like over there. There they are in the distance. Do you wanna rip
off their iconic line? Dunes, Dunes, Dunes. Dunes! Dunes! Dunes!
Dunes! Dunes! Dunes! Dunes! DUNES! DUNES!
Dunes! Dunes! Dunes! Dunes. Dunes.
Is this a reference? I thought you were a
massive Jet Lag fan! You don't remember Dunes? We have to sandboard down
Denis Villeneuve's Dune. Oh my god, here we are. Alright, we gotta
run once we get out. So we get to the top of
the first dune first. Okay, here we go. Out of the way, boys. This way. No, wait, that looks tall. No, come on. Which— which—
No, no, no. This way, this way. I just didn't lock the car, and they thought I
was manipulating them. You sure about the long grass? Let's go this way. Going to go low. Well, it's a good thing... It's a good thing that there
are no snakes in New Zealand. Let me get across here. Oh god. These dunes are not very inviting. Oh no, he's so far ahead. Sam, get in front! We meet again, Ben. I think we're gonna be
meeting again many times, Toby. Oh hell no. Ah, that's wet shoes
for the rest of the day. This is way too
much physical exercise. Yeah. A lot of uphill running. So the deal is... if they don't get it
on their first try, we have to try. We're down here
praying that they make it. This seems very steep. Alright, here we go. Oh boy. This is slower than I expected. Go Adam! Ben says I suck. This is so much slower
than I expected. Go, Sam. You're gonna make it.
You're gonna make it. D'aah! I think I've done it. You've got it, Sam.
You've got it. (silly grumbling) (bleep) Well, I'm sorry that
that was not nearly as dramatic as
we expected it'd be. Turns out these don't
go really fast. We even waxed 'em last night. Alright.
[indistinct] they don't catch up. They're also walking, but... Now we're off.
Yeah. So... It's probably gonna take a minute
to get our board in the car. Out of the way, Adam. Got the board. Come on Dan! Come on Dan! If we leave before them, we get that distance
between us and them. So we want to go, even though that we're
allowed to be first. Yeah, 'cause they were
taking their time getting the board in and stuff. Really terrible news. I've left my jacket. So I have to go get it. This is not ideal! There's our lead. Let's go!
Bye, Ben and Adam. We're never gonna see you again! Sam, this is your season. This is our season. This is, we're in it to win it. I am never in
the lead at the start. (panting) There it is. Alright, so we've got
a little coin store here, a little Powerup store. And 15 coins to spend.
And 15 coins to spend. So let's see what we've got. Here's how the Powerups work. At any point in the game,
teams can use the store where they spend coins on
one of the five powerups. The first buys you a single Nerf Dart. Both teams have a Nerf gun, and if you can hit the other
team with a Nerf bullet at any point during the game, it freezes 'em for 30 minutes. Next, you've got Roadblocks. These get drawn at random
from the Roadblock deck, and can be thrown down
behind you on your route. If your opponents encounter it, they must complete its challenge
before they continue forward. The third Powerup allows you to
turn your tracker off for 45 minutes, hiding your location
from your opponents. Then you've got Curses, which get drawn from
the Curse deck. These can be used to
curse your opponents from anywhere on the map
at any time, and will slow them down
in some unexpected way. Finally, for 100 coins, you can skip a challenge
without completing it, while still leaving it on the map for your opponents to deal with. Hey, cheeky little Nerf gun here. But that's really interesting, 'cause they have no way of
getting a Nerf bullet right now. They have no coins. Oh no coins, sorry, yeah. So if we have a Nerf bullet, we can prevent them from doing stuff, because they're not gonna
come anywhere close to us. The important parts of the game are going to be these choke points, where we are forced to
end up on the same road. So on the map, it diverges in plenty of places, but it tends to always come back
together at these choke points. And those roads, since we can guarantee that
we'll both be driving down them, might get chockablock
full of Roadblocks. I'm leaning towards just
saving our money for now? Well, I think it depends on
what they do at the intersection. (panting) (weakly) Okay... Alright, well, we're a
little behind, but that's okay. So the next intersection is Awanui. Yeah, and... Basically, it's a pretty simple choice. The east route... is all about luck. There are three challenges. They're all luck based, and there's a shortcut
that you can take... if you get lucky on
one of the challenges. The west route is longer, but all of the challenges
are much more reliable. I mean... frankly, my mindset... is that given that
we're this far behind... we just need to go
whichever way they didn't go. Yeah. So that we can get
some Powerup points. Basically, how these
games are designed is like, Ben, Adam and I,
we all do the big picture design. And then when it comes to the
more operational work, like coming up with challenges and doing the playtesting, that's what they do
while I'm off doing all those nerdy
educational channels and stuff. And that means that they know the core strategy of the
game really, really well. I've known that, and
myself and my partner have usually done a bit
of an underdog strategy, like a high risk,
high reward strategy to kind of compensate for that. But I'm realizing what that means is it's letting Ben and Adam do the strategy that they're
most comfortable with, which is not smart, because then they're
gonna do it really well. We wanna force them
off that a little bit. Yeah.
We wanna force them to do things that maybe they
weren't hoping to do, or that they thought
in their minds, planning it would be optimal. We both have, I think, the same preference
for which road to take. Yeah, I think we want to turn left. There's a shorter road. The one that, yeah, goes
along the east coast. So we will turn left at the junction, and it involves getting
lucky in a few instances. Yeah.
So it's a shorter road... but if we get unlucky with
some of these challenges, it could end up being a lot longer. Sam likes to take risks. I bet you that they're
going on the luck route. I would guess that they'd
go on the luck route as well. Which is okay 'cause we
get to do the other one. We're coming up to
our first turn off here. So we definitely
want to turn left, right? We're turning left. We're going on the get lucky route.
Alright. Turning left. Okay, so let's pull up the tracker and let's see what the boys do. It looks like they're
going on the luck route. Okay, okay, well
we're approaching it now. Do we wanna follow them? I think... You know, we could
stay closer behind them... But I think we wanna earn
some Powerup points. We have none. Yeah, no, you're right. I don't wanna risk not
getting any Powerup coins by the time of
the next intersection. Yeah.
So I think we split up. We'll go on the safe route. Earn some points.
Yeah. And then we can
start messing with them. Yeah, yeah. Oh, oh.
No, but we can shoot 'em. I think they drove past.
I think they drove past the junction. I think they're going right. I think that's the right move. I think they are. I think...
Yeah. Look, they're not coming. Okay.
Alright. I think that's what
I would do if I were them, because of the—
because they know that we could have shot them and froze them for 30 minutes. Sure, yeah. So I think they want
to do the, you know, they want to hedge their bets and do the safer routes. The first challenge
along this safe route is in a town called Kaitaia. Make a plentiful
sandwich at Kaitaia. Kaitaia means ""plentiful food"". Construct a sandwich with items from four different
stores or restaurants. At least one of the
items must be from a restaurant that is
not a fast food chain. At the Kaitaia Welcome Sign, take at least one hearty bite. I might take more
than one hearty bite. I'm hungry.
Yeah, I haven't eaten all day. Let's make a good sandwich. Ben, look, look. We are in Kaitaia now. The signs say Kaitaia.
Show the signs. There's a— Well, so
we're gonna be passing by a PAK'nSAVE almost immediately. Okay, PAK'nSAVE is gonna be good. This is PAK'nSAVE. This is, I guess, a popular— It feels like Costco, I think. Yeah, it has Costco vibes. You wanna see something cool? I would love to see something cool. There's more sand? That rocks. That's
gonna keep happening for the rest of the game. Sandwich ingredient number one. Bread. This seems fine. Whew. Vogel's original mixed grain bread. I hope that that's
a New Zealand brand. If it's not, I'm sorry. It's called toast. Is that what they call bread? Maybe.
That doesn't make any sense. Alright, we're a few minutes
from Coopers Beach now. This is where we're going
to have to dig a hole. The depth is yet to be decided. Dig a lucky hole at Coopers Beach. Roll a die. Multiply that number by six. Dig a hole of that depth
in inches at Coopers Beach. So, I mean, this definitely is make or break on the roll.
So we gotta get lucky. If we get a six or a five, that's gonna
take a minute I think. Oh, no! Sam, that's not a one.
I know! Oh, damn, okay. Oh, no. Oh, look at that. That is... Ugh... That is a lot. Ohh.
Oh, that's a lot. Alright, let's find a good spot. That was brutal. Literally the worst possible option.
Ay yi yi. Oh, here's a good stick. I'm liking the
moistness of the soil. The footprints are sinking right in. Do you have any
ideas for approach, Toby? (sigh) Just keep digging. Okay, this is some kind of
grocery something. Okay. This says it's tasty. Alright. There's something that a
lot of people don't know, Ben. In New Zealand, they drive
on the left side of the road. So... that is something I'm focused on. I just sort of keep
repeating to myself, left side of the road. That's some fun New Zealand trivia. What's fun about that trivia is that if you forget that fun fact... You'll die. We'll be dead. Catching some pipis in
the sand while we're at it. What are those? Little shells. It's already 16. Wow, okay. The problem is it's
collapsing in on itself. And we got some water in there. You know what?
We've got some avalanches. That's dirt. I'm hitting dirt. We're not gonna be
able to go deeper. You have hit solid or... Yeah. You feel that? Yeah, yeah. It was
either a large stone or... Yeah, I think we need a dryer spot. Ay yi yi. Ah, man, okay. Fill it in so
that no one gets hurt. Okay, let's go
maybe over there. Alright, we gotta
pick up the pace! Alright. Time to get our last ingredient. We do have to get
something from a restaurant. Probably don't wanna
do more cheese. No. Oh, there's cured meats. Here we go. Thank you. What do you think?
Over here? Here? I don't know if there—
this is gonna be hard. It's a lot drier, but at least it probably
won't fill with water here. And hopefully it'll be deeper. Let's get digging again. Ah, there's shells. There's so many shells. It's just turning into
pure shell. I'm wondering if
we should bore it. This is getting so shelly so fast. Yeah, that's only like 14 inches. Ah, that six has
really done us dirty. Brutal. Damn. Maybe let's go walk that way.
See if there's a better spot. This is just gonna take forever here. Third time lucky. (sputters) Maybe. Alright, we're making
really good progress, really good time.
The last thing needs to be from a non-fast food restaurant. Non-fast food restaurant. So far, things aren't
looking good. There's a— This place just
says ""Chinese food"" up there. Yeah, it's gonna
take too long, man. That place just says
""Cappuccino"". Could we go
inside of Cappuccino? Turkish restaurant is open. Oh baby. Yeah, there'll be
something fast there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is perfect. Just a side of
falafel would be great. Thank you very much.
I appreciate you. Okay, amazing time on that one. Great work,
great work, great work. Like here, maybe? I can feel like that's
gotta be deep enough. Yeah, yeah.
We're balancing two variables: sogginess and the water coming in.
Oh, that's kind of good technique. Versus being too close
to land and hitting land. Oh, that is getting pretty close. It's promising so far.
This is not too bad. Yeah, I think as long as we
don't hit the bottom again. There we go. See, Kaitaia has a
famous welcome sign that's in three languages. So we start with... Vogel's original mixed grain toast. We're gonna go with
one slice of that. And then Ben,
why don't you put on some... I believe it's pepperoni salami, which I think you can
just call pepperoni, but that's fine. And now I think the falafel. And then I think we're
just gonna sort of... Smash that. Cheese. And now that's... We've invented a new sandwich. This is a falafel,
pepperoni and cheddar. What is it? Cheddar.
Cheddar. Aged cheddar cheese sandwich. And I'm gonna take a hearty bite. Call it the Kaitaia Special. Is it good? Mhm. Progress update. We have a sinkhole. Sam, we... We in the pits here. Oh, the water is coming! Status update. Status update. I hope the sandwich— I hope that all the sandwich
shops are closed or something. I hope their
sandwich tastes like sand. That's a good sandwich. I mean, it basically
just tastes like falafel. It does. Which is delicious. This sandwich is
legitimately good. The sunk cost fallacy. Have you already dug
too deep to turn around? Or should you always
just keep digging? Let me see if
we've gotten any deeper. I think we've gotten shallower! We're not breaking progress. Are we smart enough
to realize that? No. We gotta get a move on, buddy. Okay. We're on a race. That's legitimately good. Everyone try this at home. ♪ Making pretty good time here... ♪ All I'm saying. Making pretty good time. We're gonna check their
progress in a minute. See how they're doing. We are digging
closer to depression with every scoop. I hate to say it, but what's
the veto period on this one? Let me go check. 60 minutes. Ugh! We need a different solution. Madness is doing the
same thing over again and expecting a different result. I know. I mean... should we check if
there's a better spot? We can check right here. In a linear system, that's too wet. This will be drier. Where is the point
where it gets too solid? I guess, yes. If we go halfway in here, that's kind of a
systematic way to test. Yeah, that's true. Why don't I dig
next to you up here? Then we can get a little
bit more of a test. Are they done
at Coopers Beach yet? Nope. They're still there?! They're at Coopers Beach. Man, they must have
gotten really unlucky. And I don't know
what Sam is thinking, because he is consistently unlucky in these games.
That's true. He has terrible, terrible luck. Still, it's all collapsing
in down there. Can I just have a look? Yeah, it's filling up. It's just filling up
with water and sand. Because not only is it not
keeping the structural integrity, I'm still hitting the ground. What do you think of vetoing it? I mean... can you think of anything else? I don't think so. I mean, the thing about a veto
is the veto period starts now. Yeah. So if we want a veto,
it's like sunk cost fallacy. We can't wait. I just don't— I mean— I really, really, really
would hate to veto. They're still there?! Yeah. At this point,
it seems like... either they're almost done, or they probably had to veto it. Not doing good. Not doing good. Off to a good start, but... Man, they're really gonna
need to get that shortcut. I'm thinking that this is
just fundamentally impossible. Let's just veto
it then and move on. I think yeah, I agree. I really hate... I'm gonna be so depressed. I think it's the smart
thing to do at this point. Just do it, just do it. So it's 11:05. We're gonna have to
wait until 12:05. That is brutal. Sucks for them! #SucksToBeThem! So that's the thing
about the luck route. Sometimes your luck
ain't so good. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Welcome to
season five, everyone! We are so excited to be back. This season is gonna
be quite something. Like there are actually
genuinely multiple moments that I am actively worried about how hard it's gonna
be to be able to convince y'all that
they're not staged. It's a really dramatic season. I think it's gonna be really good. And I can't wait for
y'all to see the rest. And as y'all probably know,
the show is basically paid for almost entirely by our
Nebula subscribers. So this season, we are
giving them more than ever. They can all watch
episode two right now. If you're a Nebula subscriber
watching here for some reason, go watch episode two
right now on Nebula. It's already up. You know, that's because we
release every single episode a week early on Nebula
for the entire show forever. This season, we're
doing something extra. This season, we are, every Wednesday night after
releasing an episode on Nebula, Ben, Adam, Toby, and myself,
we are recording a podcast. It's called The Layover. And basically we're gonna be
talking through our strategies, talking about what
happened behind the scenes, answering viewer questions. It's great, we've already
recorded the first one. In fact, it's already up
for the first episode, because Nebula subscribers watched
the first episode last week, and we're gonna be doing it
for every single episode, and even through the off season. So, and that's Nebula exclusive. You have to be a Nebula
subscriber to listen to that, because it's, you know,
it's an appreciation to the fact that, again, they're paying for all
of this pretty much. But these subscribers are actually
getting even more than this, because there's like more than
a hundred other top quality creators also on Nebula, who are releasing all their
videos early and ad-free as well. And then on top of that, there's all sorts of big
budget Nebula originals by all these creators. And they're really good, and they're always coming out. For example, like
just a few weeks ago, I went to the premiere of The Prince by Abigail Thorn. I already had high
expectations going in, but it beat my high expectations. It was genuinely really
entertaining to watch. So I definitely recommend it. And what makes Nebula
even better is that if you sign up at our link,
nebula.tv/jetlag, not only will you get $20
off an annual subscription, but a portion of your
subscription fee will go to us, directly to us, for as
long as you say subscribed. Which you know, not only gives us
like monthly recurring revenue, which is, you know, a much more
stable way for us to operate, but it also allows us
to use that revenue to be able to invest
in future seasons and make them bigger and better
and more frequently and all that. So, you know,
you get stuff, we get stuff. It's a great deal for everyone. So click the button on screen or head to nebula.tv/jetlag to sign up and watch
the next episode now, listen to podcasts, watch all
the originals, get everything. It's a great deal.
It's the best Jet Lag experience, and it helps support us. So thanks in advance.
See you next week."

The production has offset 10x its estimated carbon impact through The Wren climate portfolio: https://www.wren.co/profile/wendoverproductions","RnSUaZEwYq4","Hello and welcome to
the final episode of our race to claim
the most states. It's the beginning of
day four, the final day, and there are 15 hours left
until the clock strikes 11 pm Eastern,
and the game ends. Right now, Ben and Adam
have claimed 11 states, and Brian and I have claimed six,
but the score is 11-8, because we're in the lead for
the all-important two point bonus that goes to the team that's
claimed the greatest area. But that score
could change quickly. If we managed to claim
Arizona before Ben and Adam, we could battle for Nevada
and tie the game for the very first time
since day one. When you last saw Brian and I,
we were on a helicopter from Boulder City, Nevada
to the Grand Canyon, planning to complete the
drink soup in a helicopter card the moment we cross into Arizona. When we last left Ben and Adam,
they were in a car also, as it turns out,
headed to the Grand Canyon, where they plan to complete the
clean up a national park card. Whichever team can complete their
challenge first will claim Arizona and completely change
the course of the game. Alright, day four.
How are you feeling, Adam? Oh, I'm feeling very confident. That is starting to look... pretty grand. Add it to the the sky bridge.
I've got tickets here. Okay. It's not open till eight. Oh, okay. Yeah, but feel free
to park over here. Hello, we are here
in the beautiful parking lot of the
Grand Canyon. We are at Grand Canyon West. It's like 7:0-something. It turns out that the sky bridge
does not open until eight. But I'm pretty sure
that we're already in... the national park. We just have to be
in the national park. So I'm assuming if we
just go and find litter... I just need to double check
that we're in the national park. So we're right here. We're basically on the airport. So... the national park... So it's this darker green
thing, is the national park. Are we not in the park? Wait, Grand Canyon West is
like the national park, right? No. No, it goes around the
other side of the canyon. What? Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is like a—
It's carved out here. Do you see this?
And it's like, it stops here. It's miles that way. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Yes, sir? Is this part of
Grand Canyon National Park, or is this a different...? This is different. This is...
Okay. ...the Grand Canyon West,
which has the Skywalk. Right, but it's
not the national park? No. National park's over in
Williams, Arizona. (bleep) We need to
get back in the car. Oh my god, we need to leave. Okay. Okay. Okay. This isn't the national park? This isn't the national park. It's very beautiful. And it is the Grand Canyon. This is the Grand Canyon. That is right over there,
the Grand Canyon's right over there. But it turns out there is
actually nothing we can do here. (sobbing laughter) This is so bad! Let's go wait by the car. We need to get
to the airport now. Where's Ray? Ray's in the bathroom,
but he's coming. He's coming back out. We're sorry. We really wanted to show
you the Grand Canyon. We'll show a lot of
stock footage of the Grand Canyon. Well, you can take a nap. ^0We did it, Brian. This is like the prettiest
shot of the season. Okay. This is really bad. I don't have a follow-up.
No. This is really bad.
It's really bad. But we have a plan B. It's time for plan B. I don't know if we can
still pull off plan B. But we can try. Ray, I'm so sorry.
We gotta go to the airport. Okay, alright, we're
on our way back right now. We've just gotten a
video from Sam and Brian. Oh my god, are
they in a helicopter? They are. Well, it turns
out it didn't matter. They got Arizona before us. Although I think we
would've beaten them to it by like... By like a few minutes.
Fifteen minutes. Oh. ^0Adam texted back. I inferred it as a disappointed
""I see"" in response. I feel like they were
on their way to Arizona. It would make sense. Brian, give us words. Suck it, Ben. They would've beaten the— They would've been
in the helicopter when we beat them to Arizona. That would've been pretty—
That would've been so funny. To Ben and Adam. ^0Cheers. Well done. Goodness. Whoa! Did you get that?
Yeah, I did. Hey, look. It's Sam and Brian, maybe. That was (bleep) cool. That was incredible.
That was amazing. ^0But we have to focus,
'cause we have 11 hours left, and we are back in this game. If we win this now,
if we get Nevada back, we'll draw 'em.
Yeah. We have been six states down. ^0I thought we had no shot,
but we have proven we very much do,
we're back in this game. The bald eagle was our saviour. ^0So we got a battle
challenge now, right? Yep.
So should we notify them? Yes.
You wanna call Adam? Just try and keep
keep your head down. There you go, you look—
What? Oh geez, that's
very close. Hello. What do you want? ^0I think you know what we want. We want to battle. ^0Battle challenge,
30 minutes start, countdown starts now. Understood. Farewell. ^0He's really not showing
us his background. He's trying to keep
his background covert. Alright, let's get into downtown. That is really
good timing, okay. We're gonna be at the
airport in 12 minutes. We'll have 18 minutes
to get settled to get ready for
the battle challenge. Probably get through security. Maybe, yep. We really need to win this. We really need to
win this battle. ^0Alright, Brian, we are
allowed to pull another card now. Excited. We need some luck.
We need the spirit of the eagle. Ca-caw! ^0Get a hole in one in mini golf. That's hard. ^0Well, I don't know. There's mini golf anywhere. You play golf? 'Cause I don't. ^0No, I'm terrible at golf. Yeah, so then... Alright, Ray,
I've put in the tip. Here's an extra hundred. Ooh, thank you. Thank you so much! Thank you so, so much.
You have a great day. So we're gonna
sprint through security. Try to get through security
before the challenge starts. I love your Jet Lag. Oh! Thanks!
We're doing it right now. Holy (bleep) I watched it on the plane. That's amazing.
Yo don't— Okay, don't tell
anyone we were here. Okay. I am... My heart is actually pounding. ^0Oh yeah, I'm nervous.
This is make or break. I am very much
invested in this now. Oh my goodness. Okay, well we've
made it through security just barely in time. The challenge is gonna
start in one minute. We're gonna get to a
non-descript wall. That way they won't know that we're here at the
airport when they call. ^0This is like genuinely
probably the most nervous I've been in the game.
Yeah. Alright, that was weird. Hello? ^0So close, Adam,
what's behind you? They're at an airport.
I can hear it. Oh yes, like an airport.
Oh, that's interesting. Anyway, let's draw a card.
How about that, Adam? Where's Ben? Hi. Hi. ^0Draw George Washington. Draw George Washington. Each team must select one
player to draw a portrait of George Washington. That player has 30 minutes
to gather materials and create the portrait
in any way possible. At the end of the 30 minutes,
the portraits will be judged by an anonymous poll posted
on Sam's Twitter account. This is very much 50-50. ^0Yeah, they actually are
in a decent spot for that. Right, you ready for this? It's time, let's go.
Bye-bye. Okay, let's search
for arts and crafts. ^0The hardware store? I'm sure we can get
markers and stuff there. They figured out we
were at the airport, okay. Very quickly they did. Okay, we gotta draw a
portrait of George Washington. We still have the
art supplies, don't we? No. You threw them away? I threw some of them away. I've still got this pad. And do you have
the markers then? No. You threw them away?
Yeah. Well, I wish you
hadn't done that. Are you good at drawing?
Yeah. ^0Okay, good, I'm not. Are you better at drawing
or am I better at drawing? I don't know, are you
any good at drawing? No, I'm bad at drawing. I feel like I'm maybe
slightly better. But I'm pretty bad. You did a very
good job with the Mao. I was impressed with your details. I think I want you to draw
this George Washington. It's right here. Oh, awesome, thank you.
Thank you. Did we just luck out? Oh, god. ^0Okay, quickly.
What do we want? Oh yeah, that's perfect. Crayons?
Crayons, yeah. ^0This is pretty good,
this poster board. Okay, let's go. I stole this. Okay, so... Art projects for kids. How to draw
George Washington. It has a whole—
It has a guide. That seems like a
pretty good first line. Okay. How do we ponder
to your audience? ^0Here. I don't know,
I don't know. Planes? ^0Yeah, put some planes in. I think we draw him
in a pose like this. Yeah.
And... Look at all these bricks. ^0Oh, that's a good idea.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, bricks. Bricks are gonna do it. Oh god. Oh god. Just wanna rough
out the shape first. ^0Brian, I think we can get this. Me too. This feels like
it's going pretty well. I'm loving what I'm seeing. I just feel like
my big concern is that it lacks pizzazz. So I'm thinking
once we get the line drawing
knocked out, you know? But then we're gonna
go around the— We'll look around the airport for
anything that would add some pizazz. Okay, this is the
important part. The nose and the eyes. This is gonna
make or break us. The big hunking stack of bricks. ^0Oh, there's some good bricks. Do you know if either
of them are decent drawers? ^0Not really. Okay, now that I'm
seeing more of the face, it doesn't actually look
anything like George Washington. Nope. ^0Oh, that's pretty good.
That's some good— That's like recognizably
George Washington. Nice job, Brian. It looks like... No, I'm not gonna say that. I think it looks great, Adam. I think it's just
his face is too long. So I think if I... No, now his neck looks insane. No, that was a bad idea. I'm gonna just pretend—
I mean, he's wearing— Let's just say he's
wearing a turtleneck, right? Very fashion forward. ...Yeah. ^0What if he just
like says bricks? Yeah, no, we're gonna
make him say something bricky. ^0What was your
suggestion, Brian? ""If the freedom of
bricks is taken away, then dumb and silent
we may be led."" I think that's perfect.
Okay. ^0Ah, that's excellent. Oh yeah. I think that this is
gonna be what we go with. And then we just need
some pizzazz. So I say we run a—
Let's just try to find anything that would add pizzazz. I mean, we just need
some pizzazz. There's— What if we like
made this wig out of gummy worms or something? Ooh. You know, the audience
might like creativity. You know,
that's what I'm saying. We just need like some... Yeah, gummy worm hair.
...pizzazz. I feel like this
could just give it the extra pizzazz that it needs. ^0Alright, should we get some
backgrounds with some paint? This is excellent stuff. I'm sure that this is the best
we could have possibly done. Yeah. ^0That's the 10 am bell.
We have three minutes. We want those
clouds to sit down. Do what we say
to the clouds now. We say, sit down cloud,
sit down. ^0I don't know what
you're talking about. What a fun postmo—
you know, postmodern— Yeah, what does
this say about society? What does this say about society? I actually think
this is kind of working. It... yeah, it looks... ...fun. I think it's like,
""Oh, you know, like, now they're saying something."" Yeah, we're saying... What if George Washington
had gummy worm hair? Yeah. And it's sort of like... That's a pretty big question. You know? For society. This is the blood of the fallen. It represents the
blood of the fallen. Extreme painting! ^0This is great stuff. They can't possibly have done
better than that in an airport. Nice job, Brian. I'm (bleep) Picasso. It's just the boys hanging. 10:04. Send it. I really am excited to see
what they think about our... interpretation of this
nation's first president. ^0Alright, they sent
their photo, Brian. Do I...?
Pull it up on your phone. (giggling) They used 
(bleep) gummy worms. ^0They gummy
worms for their hair. That's kind of genius. ^0Technically that's allowed. Ours is definitely
like, oh, I don't know. Like that's kind of funny.
Yours is pretty good. I mean, for the time they
had, that's pretty good. Wow, okay. Very different interpretation. I think it's frankly
a complete toss up. It's a total tougher. I think it could go either way, and that's making me
very nervous. As the votes start to
pour in, I'm gonna be— Well, the thing is, we're not
gonna be able to look at the votes, 'cause the only way to look
at the votes is by voting. You ready?
Yeah. ^0Come on, audience. Come on. Do it for us.
I believe in you. ^0You're gonna win this for us. It's out there. (whispering)
Oh my god, I'm so nervous. ^0I am so nervous. Oh god, I'm so nervous. My heart is pounding. My heart is actually pumping
over this stupid challenge. Please, please, please,
please, please, please. Come on, come on. Oh my gosh. I can't believe it— It said one
minute left for like— Oh, poll ending, poll ending. ^0Oh, I don't wanna... Yes! (soft wail) (devolves into grumble) I just yelled in the—
That was so loud. I yelled so loud
in the airport. That was so loud
in the airport. I yelled really
loud in the airport. Yeah, we've lost it. ^0Yeah. (groaning sigh) All the arts and the
crafts in the world couldn't have beaten 
(bleep) gummy worm. ^0It's a stroke of genius. Those (bleep)
damn comedic writers. George Wormington has taken— George Wormington
has taken the win. And that means
that we keep Nevada. It's locked. It cannot be messed with. And... (exhausted grunt) That puts us in a
pretty good position. Great call on the gummy worms. Great call on the gummy worms. ^0So... We just tallied up
all of the area. ^0If they get Alaska, it's theirs. The game is theirs by far. And what's really worrying me is that they have a good itinerary. If they... If they grab the flight
to Seattle that leaves in 40 minutes,
let me just confirm. Yeah, this flight to Seattle,
Alaska Airlines flight to Seattle. There's plenty of connections
to Ketchikan, for example. Ohh. To everyone who voted
for George Wormington. I love you. Thank you so much for
voting for George Wormington. To everyone who did not... You tried—
You're dead to us. You tried to take us down,
but we're stronger than that. Now... we're off to seal the game. Where are we going? I can't wait for you to find out. ^0If that's truly
what they're doing, if they're truly going for Alaska, we need to do the best
job possible to be sure that they cannot complete
their challenge in Alaska. So what will do that... is stealing the right
cards away from them and giving them cards that
they simply cannot do there. I mean, there's only one thing
that could mess up our plan, and it's if we missed
our connection. Right, because we're
flying somewhere, and then we are flying
somewhere from there. And if we do not make
it to that last place... We won't win.
Yeah. ^0Right, we have a plan.
What's the plan, Brian? Fly to Denver. ^0Fly to Denver, 'cause
there's three states that we can easily get to.
Hop over the border, yeah. ^0We'd have to use
power-ups to cross, but we have some challenges
that we think we could use. The smallest town in
Wyoming is right on the border. ^0Super easy to get to.
That gets us a power-up. There's also the mini golf one. Yeah, there's like four
mini golf places in Fort... What's it called, Fort Collins?
Fort Collins, yeah. That's near the border as well,
so we can start driving there. Yeah.
We need three to win, which I think is
feasible to do today. ^0Yeah. Two to tie. And we need enough to
disrupt them with cards they can't do in Alaska.
Yeah. So they could get to Alaska as
soon as like 2 pm our time. Which makes me think we
should get the tracker. I don't, I just
disagree with the tracker. I think we have enough
information to assume they're going to Alaska. I feel like power-ups
are gonna be... Okay, let's think about this. We need to disrupt their
hand as much as possible. We have four, and they can
swap them back again. They could have a power-up. Yeah.
We need one to cross the border. ^0Yeah. We need another one
to cross the border again. ^0Yeah. We don't have enough for... I don't think, to do the tracker. ^0I feel like the tracker
info is so crucial, because we can figure out
where they are in Alaska. 'Cause for example,
it's gonna be very different— If they're in Ketchikan, then forge
American art would be really hard. Yeah. ^0But if they're in Anchorage,
that could be really easy, 'cause there are some
big museums in Anchorage. Right.
So contextually, it's important. You've convinced me. ^0Nine hours left in the game. The tracker's good for seven hours, so I feel like we should
activate it basically now. Alright. Agreed?
I'm so invested in this. Agreed?
Yeah. Alright. Well, they're buying
the tracker on us. They've bought the tracker. Right at the right time.
I guess they're just gonna... see what we're gonna do. Not sure if there's
anything they can do. Nope. Nope. This is just gonna
be painful for them. ^0They're still here. They must be delayed. ^0No, no, they're here,
they're in the airport. They could be on the
Alaska flight leaving 11:10. Yeah, but that's
good news, because that means they
waited until later. I don't know why, 'cause it
was a 7 am flight to Seattle. I don't know why they
spent all morning here. We're waiting in line for Chili's. ♪ Chili's ♪ ^0They have no idea where we are.
They have no idea where we're going. They probably don't think that
we have this good of a plan. So they probably think that,
oh, let's just fly to Alaska. We don't, you know,
easy rest of the day. And GG, game over.
Yeah. ^0They don't know that
we have a great plan, and we have a real
shot at victory. Yeah. ^0But yeah, let's go to Colorado. On the Sam Denby. That's me. Oh, I thought
your name was Wendy. No.
Your name's Sam? ^0Yeah. Hello and
welcome to our layover, on our way to
not only win, but... crush Sam into a
small, fine powder. Howdy, partner. ^0We've gotta rush, come on. Welcome to Colorado, Brian. To the other side of the air— Which one are you gonna pick? ^0Vroom, boy. Okay, so... It is exactly 5 pm, which means we have
exactly four hours left. There's a lot we gotta do, but this is why we have a plan. Here's the plan: We need three points
to win the game, and we have five steps
to get there. Step one, drive an hour
to Fort Collins, Colorado and claim the state and
a power-up by making a hole in one at mini golf. Step two, use that power-up to
unlock the border with Wyoming, where we'll drive
another hour to Buford, the smallest town in the state, to advertise Jet Lag: The Game, claiming Wyoming and
another power-up. Step three, use that power-up to
unlock the border with Nebraska, drive an hour there, and use whatever
cards we have left to claim it. Step four, hope Ben and Adam
are in fact going to Alaska. Step five, when they
hopefully arrive, use the swap power-up
to steal any cards they could do
wherever they landed, thus preventing them from claiming
the state or the area bonus, and stranding them too far from the
contiguous US to do a backup plan. If all this works,
it would put our score at 12, their score at 11,
thus winning the game. There are four hours
of game time left, and that plan involves
three hours of driving alone, so there's absolutely
no room for error, and none of it even matters
if Ben and Adam went to a state other than Alaska. So we're at our gate now. They can see we're at our gate. I'm really hoping that
that means that right now, there's footage of Sam that
we can cut to of him saying, ""Oh my god,
they're going to Alaska."" I hope Sam is losing it. Sam never loses his cool. It's honestly
very frustrating. Which is honestly
very frustrating, 'cause it would be
really funny if he did. Yeah. But maybe this time he did. Maybe. Because we're
about to screw him. ^0I did some digging with
some webcams in Ketchikan. I did not see a morsel of snow. Now it does snow at this time of
year there, so I could be wrong, but at least on the
webcam, I couldn't see any. We do know that they have
spell help on an island, which would be super easy. They'll literally land on an island. Like Ketchikan Airport
is on an island. I mean, we've filmed
there actually for a Nebula-exclusive documentary. Alaska's Silent Summer.
Use the code REALENGINEERING. ^0No, no, no.
JETLAG, JETLAG. REALENGINEERING.
Or whatever. I actually really
need it at the moment. Our conversions are down. I'm not getting paid for this. ^0Yes, you literally are.
Stop lying to the audience. We made a whole
documentary about Ketchikan. We're gonna go see Paula. It was a very sad
documentary, so hopefully it's not
so sad there right now. Yeah. ^0Honestly, the difference
between like five minutes at mini golf
and 15 minutes at mini golf could absolutely decide the season. 100 percent. ^0♪ I'm so stressed,
I'm so stressed ♪ Look, GlowGolf! Okay, park. ^0Oh, I should park, Brian?
You think I should park? It's an easy one
with this green one here. ^0Nope. (chuckles)
Brian! Jesus Christ! Nope. Ooh... ooh! No. (bleep) (bleep) (huff) (bleep) Oh (bleep) (bleep) you. Go on! Oh, no, okay.
(bleep) Here, Brian. Sam. (bleep) (grunt) Oh my god. Ooh... No. (bleep) it. ^0Brian! Concentrate. Oof (bleep) We're running outta holes. ^0Yeah. Mmm (bleep) Oh! (bleep) (angry growl) Went over the hole. Okay, don't hit that hard. (bleep) this. You keep bouncing the ball. Sam, stop. (bleep) (bleep) ^0Not too hard. Oh!
Ah, I told you not to. You gotta soften your hip.
Stop. Soft. (bleep) What is this? (squeal) Let's (bleep) go.
Let's (bleep) go, Sam. We did it. (bleep)
I can't (bleep) believe it. Let's go. (bleep) ^0Alright. I can't believe it. That was looking so bleak. Alright, I'm putting the
directions in for Buford, Montana. One hour, nine minutes. (bleep) me. ^0Oh man, we might
actually get this, Brian. Oh, we get to pull a new card. ^0Oh, yeah, yeah.
You have the cards, right? Yeah, yeah. ^0Bet on roulette. I don't know if there's
any casinos. Let's check.
Okay. So Ben and Adam are about
six minutes away from landing. This is crunch time. Welcome to Alaska, buddy. Yay. Alright, so they landed. ^0And they're about to
receive some unfortunate news approximately now. I hope it's not... I hope they're getting
unfortunate news. I hope we've ruined their day. ^0The cut already happened. Okay.
Because that's why— We got an extremely ominous
message from Sam and Brian. They sent us a video.
They said, ""Wait til you get off the
plane to react to the video and watch it all the way through."" It's either a really good
thing or a really bad thing. Okay.
Okay. Time to watch... this. I'm so nervous. Okay. Video from Sam and Brian. Okay. Hello lads.
Hello! I hope your flight
to Alaska was gorgeous. ^0I think we have
some news for you. We have some news.
Some news. A welcome gift to Alaska. Colorado is ours. Colorado.
Also... Also? ^0Also we are using one power-up
to steal two of your cards. We're also gifting you two cards,
'cause you know we're nice and that's the power-up. We're gifting you mail this
card and visit the Grand Canyon. I hope you can make it
the Grand Canyon in time. Anyways, we're busy,
we got stuff to do. Hope you enjoy your
time in Ketchikan... And enjoy the evening. Suck it.
Yeah. Okay, well, they've
used a swap on us. They've used a swap. We are simply
going to swap back. We anticipated
that they might do this. We just have to hope that
they cannot swap us again. They were in a car,
so my hope is that they used
another power-up... Right.
to cross a border. Okay. Okay. Okay, we are so close
to the border, so we're just going for it. We're playing a risky bet. ^0Yep. Alright, here we are. It's the blue one? Yep.
That's the sign right there. There's Wyoming, and that's
our power-up gone. Power-up gone. ^0We have zero power-ups
right now, but in... Welcome to Wyoming. In, let's see, 29 minutes,
we'll get another power-up. Okay, okay. We will send them our hand. So they have:
go sky diving, win top-tier prize,
shoot a bullseye, spell help, skip a stone
over a sunken town, clean up a national park,
build a snowman. Build a snowman, and help. Okay, I'm nervous. How do we get outta this place? So just to be clear,
Ketchikan is on an island. They're on actually
a different island. This is Gravina Island,
and so we can spell— Okay, gravel right here. Oh my god, it's rock central. And a perfect place to spell help. Okay, so. This place rocks. Haha. Nailed it.
Get it? ^0We're sure the
snowman's one's worth it? There's no other ones there. ^0You sure? Shoot a bullseye potentially. ^0Shoot a bullseye, but
it's with bow and arrow, right? Yeah.
No, no, just... (bleep) We have to do it, Sam.
Okay, fine, send it. Oh, that's them. Snowman and spell help.
We suspected that. So inform them that
we are swapping back. Okay, I'm gonna call them. They're probably responding.
Hello? Hello gentlemen. We would like to
swap cards with you. ^0Alright. Alright, we would like spell help
and the s'mores one please. Got it.
Okay. Okay, bye. Bye.
Bye. They didn't swap back.
They didn't swap back, okay. Time to spell help
before they do. (bleep bleep bleep)
Oh, damn. Our one chance.
We got 20 minutes. ^0We have 21 minutes.
They can do it by then. (bleep) damn it. Oh no. Well, no, but like if we,
if we manage to get there, get the power-up and steal—
They have 21 minutes. Put the (bleep) down.
They're on an island right now. I mean, we gotta try. We gotta try.
Aw man. I don't think it's gonna take
them 20 minutes to do it. ^0Aw man. Each letter
must be one foot tall. Oh, it's rock time. Oh (bleep) Oh, my hands are so cold.
These rocks are so cold. Okay, that's an H. (silly growl)
(bleep) It was a valiant (bleep) effort. So close. ^0Oh my god! Is there anything
we could do right now? ^0There's nothing we can do. Oh, we should have stopped
before the Wyoming border. Good? Yeah. This is triumphant music
playing in the background. Literally (bleep) minutes in it. Minutes in it. They're on an island.
They're on the (bleep) (growl) Wait, one more rock. Okay. We have spelled help on an island. Gravina Island in Alaska, that
means we have claimed Alaska. Let's call Sam and Brian.
And that's the game, baby! Let's call 'em. Oh, woo! Way to go, buddy.
We did it. We did it. The score is now,
I believe 14 to eight. Eight. Is that correct? Hello?
Wait, wait, wait. Hello, gentlemen.
Wait, wait, wait. We're filming.
Brian doesn't know how to film. Okay, go ahead.
Okay. Hello. Hi. Gentlemen... we come to you... from America's largest... and some might say its most
beautiful state, Alaska, and we have claimed it. Show us the sign. Help. Help!
Help! This is what you're
gonna need to win the game. Any thoughts?
Any parting words, gentlemen? ^0This is great.
We wanted this to happen. I'm totally fine with this. We still have two hours.
Of course. Totally have path to
victory, whatever, bye. Bye-bye.
Okay... Peace out.
Good bye, lads. Bye-bye.
Good luck. Yay! It's gonna get dark
in like 30 minutes. So we really are going to,
we really want do like a... This is the majestic
splendor of Alaska. Look at this, look at
how beautiful it is! It's very beautiful.
Look all around! Isn't it incredible? And this is what it
looks like in late October. Ah, it's so beautiful here. Look at this. Now we just have to figure
out how to get over there. Yeah, we gotta figure
out how to get over there. Okay.
Kids. ^0That one fricking power-up. That did it. It wasn't for that one
fricking power-up they had, if they had just decided
to swap cards once or had a tracker or something. Damn. Anyway, it's been real, Brian. It's been nice having you back. Do you think we should have
spent the tracker on the... ^0There it is. That gas station, that's Buford. We're here in the
smallest town in Wyoming. Okay, let's call 'em, Brian. I want them to see this. Okay. Okay.
Alright. ^0They're back, Brian. Okay, they've
just called us again. ^0Alright, guys. We come to you from
Buford, Wyoming. I don't know if you know, but Buford is the smallest
town in Wyoming. Population,
what was it, like one? One person. Oh my goodness. Are you advertising for
Jet Lag: The Game there? Wait, it's the smallest
town in Wyoming? ^0We are leaving an
ineffective advertisement for Jet Lag: The Game. It's absolutely... Baltic out. ^0So the sign says, in
case you're wondering, it says: https://youtube.com/jetlagthegame. Quote, ""It's good"" by Wendy,
and then it was given, uh uh. What is that?
It's a minus. Four stars minus one,
so I guess that equals three. Oh, that makes a lot of sense.
That makes sense. Yeah, people are gonna love
how much sense that makes. ^0Okay, so I don't know if you
realize that means that we have claimed the great state of Wyoming. Congratulations. (indistinct) Well done. ^0However... We also concede that
at this point in the day, we have no viable path to victory, with y'all having claimed
the area bonus from Alaska. Therefore...
I'll let this truck pass. Therefore, I really hate to say it, but Brian and I would like to
congratulate y'all for having won season four of Jet Lag: The Game. Yay!
Yay! Let's go baby! Let's go, let's go.
Woo-hohohoo! ^0We do have something for you. I've been carrying this thing
around the entire time in my rucksack,
and my back is broken. ^0Yeah. Alright. (chuckling) Yeah. That general direction. Launch it, Sam. Oh my god, it's a big one. ^0Yeah, this is the biggest
one we've had yet. Why're you crouching? Oh, oh, it's crushing me. Oh, that is—
Push it in! Thank you! Yes!
Yes! Got it?
Wow. We got it! Oh, that's amazing. That's the best, most amazing
trophy in the whole world. And we spent—
Hey, Brian. Hey, Brian. Would you like— I'm feeling very tired
here at the end. Would you like to say the honors? Say what honours? You gotta say the line, Brian. Say the line, Brian.
Say the line, Brian. What's the line? ^0Are you feeling tired? Very tired. ^0What would a word be? Oh, oh.
You know what I'm saying, Brian! I guess I have jet lag. ^0Oh, he said the word!
He said the word! Let's go!
Yeah! He said the word.
He said the word. I genuinely didn't know
what was going on. See you next season folks! We'll see you wherever
that happens to be very soon. Woo! Bye! Bye! ^0Bye! Bye! See you next season, bye! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Well, I just finished filming
the season four aftershow. I didn't actually.
I filmed it three days ago, but I forgot to film this then,
but it was right there. Anyways, I just finished
filming the season four aftershow, and it was great. We showed all sorts of, you know,
deleted footage, for example. We showed all this stuff that we
had to cut out that Brian said that was too inappropriate for YouTube. We showed more of Ben drunk. We showed all of the times I tried
to talk about Formula One stuff, or showed Formula One stuff, and Ben and Adam cut
it outta the final cut. All sorts of stuff like that. We also answered
all sorts of questions. So if you ever ask this season, ""Why did Sam do this?""
or ""Why did Ben do this?"" or like stuff like that,
we answered it probably on there. We answered all sorts of
these strategy questions, really went into detail. It's kind of a great aftershow. It's long, it's full,
it's worth it, it's fun. And it's exclusive to Nebula,
because here's the thing. Our Nebula subscribers quite
literally fund this show. You know, while this show is
growing on YouTube, and we're super appreciative to that, it's a very expensive show to make,
takes a lot of time and money, and the only way that
we are able to pay for that is because of our
Nebula subscribers. Because literally tens of thousands
of you have gone over there and signed up to watch every
single episode of Jet Lag one week early and
sponsorship free. And that's what makes this
show work, like financially. That's what makes it work. And we are incredibly
grateful for that. So, you know, if you want
to become one of those tens of thousands of people who get kind of the full
Jet Lag viewing experience, the good news is that there's
this crazy good deal going on, because Curiosity Stream,
our partner, they've been offering
this bundle deal, where if you sign up for
any of their subscriptions... Monthly, annual,
4K, HD, any of them... when you sign up for any of
their subscriptions at our link, curiositystream.com/jetlag, they'll throw in a Nebula
subscription for free. And over there there's like
loads of really good content. Non-fiction shows
and documentaries, by big names like
David Attenborough, Jane Goodall, et cetera. So, you know, that can help,
you know, fill the content void from Jet Lag being off
for the next little bit. And in addition to that, you know,
again, 'cause the bundle deal, you'll have access to all of Nebula. And there's loads of really
good original stuff from us, ourselves on Wendover and HAI. We've made plenty of original stuff. There's stuff from Brian,
you know, our guest. He's made loads of
original stuff too. And then there's like
150 other creators that are also making all
sorts of really good stuff. Uploading early, ad free,
sponsorship free, everything. It's such a good deal,
all of this. What's crazy, all of this,
it comes out to $15 when you pay annually,
like overall for the year. That's not monthly.
That's like for the year. For two streaming sites for the
cost of like a month of another one. Crazy good deal.
And it helps support us. It literally helps
keep this show going. So if you wanna see
the aftershow now, if you wanna see the next season
one week before anyone else, if you wanna see all the original
stuff by all sorts of other creators on Curiosity Stream and Nebula, click the button on screen, head

The production has offset 10x its estimated carbon impact through The Wren climate portfolio: https://www.wren.co/profile/wendoverproductions","2NPGrKItt3E","Welcome back to our race
to claim the most states. This is episode four, and right now,
we're halfway through day three. The game will end at
11 pm EST tomorrow, and whichever team has
completed a challenge in the most states by that point
will win the game. Right now, the game is tightening. Brian and I have
begun to cut into Ben and Adam's lead
by claiming Texas, which puts us in the lead
for the two-point bonus for the team that
claims the most area. That means the score is 7-9, but Ben and Adam are hoping to
make it 7-10 by claiming Michigan, which they can do by breaking
one of Michigan's strangest laws: it is a felony to seduce and
debauch an unmarried woman. You know what?
Let's find somewhere to eat. While we while we're eating,
we'll work on a dating profile. Should we— Let's call—
let's give JT a call, and just confirm that he
thinks this works. Hey buddy. Okay. If we got them to spread
misinformation online about Brian... Would that count as corrupting
their— corrupting them? That is a crime, absolutely. You have my full support. Okay, thanks JT. We need to pull another card, and then we need to
decide whether we're flying to Vegas or to California. Our Uber is four minutes away. Top card as always. Oh (bleep), wait.
I didn't see it. It's alright, we'll reshuffle. Find a four-leaf clover as a leprechaun.
Oh for (bleep) sake. At least one team member must
be dressed as a leprechaun. The costume may be makeshift,
is open to creative interpretation. That one's pretty good, I think, because we can do that
in a lot of places. And it gets us a power-up. Okay. We just need to go to
a Spirit Halloween again to get a leprechaun suit.
And go back to DC? Okay, that's good. So question maintains: California or Vegas? I think Vegas, 'cause it's
closer, it gives us more time. It's not, it doesn't have a
real difference in flight time. Does that not?
No, it won't— Then I would say,
just to guarantee... I don't know what we
can do in Vegas tonight. Yeah, I think we
should do California. California.
Lock it in? Lock it in.
Alright. I'm really glad we have Texas. That was just
three points right there. Yeah. We needed that.
We went from 4 to 7. As long as we can
maintain the area bonus. Which I think... hopefully we can.
Hopefully. Hey, for Sam. Hey, how's it going? Okay. Alright. I think it's time to seduce and
debauch and unmarried woman. Here's my Tinder. This is a photo of me that
we took for a thumbnail. But... my mom said it was a
really good photo of me. Gonna set my age preference
from 18 to 100+. We're just gonna go,
we're gonna go fast. Keep swiping right.
Can we do a boost? Can we spend Sam's money
on a boost? What's the boost do? It just puts you at the top. Oh, totally. Or it's, what's a super boost? It's $70. But it's only $40
for three hours. But we would get up to a
hundred times more views. Great. Thank you.
Awesome. Thank you very much.
Very much, thank you. It's gonna be a lot of
plane time today. Apologies to the audience.
We haven't really done anything. We have not...
Plane, in and out. I hope Ben and Adam are
being entertaining right now. Sam, I'm spending
40 of your dollars on a super boost
on my Tinder profile. Swipe, swipe, swipe.
So we're just gonna— We just have to
go insane on the swipes. Alright, we've finished
lunch at Jackie's Cafe. Delicious.
Wonderful. Let's go seduce and
debauch an unmarried woman. Alright. Someone has already
messaged us. Ooh, okay. Here's my message to Alexis: ""Okay, this is gonna sound
weird, but I'm a YouTuber. It's called Jet Lag: The Game. And I am in Michigan to
break a very archaic law about corrupting the morals
of an unmarried woman. Would you be interested in
very, very quickly helping me out by tweeting something lol?"" You're covering your microphone. Oh (bleep) Would I respond to this
message? I don't know. This is gonna (bleep) up my
Tinder for a very long time. (laughs uproariously) I'm so nervous.
I was really nervous. I'm more—
I'm so nervous! Any response from Alexis yet? No, she has unmatched us. Oh, Alexis has unmatched us. Alexis has unmatched us. Let's see if anyone
else responds. Shea has hit us with a
question mark, which is okay. Kiki says, ""I think you might need to
recenter your goals on dating apps."" So true. I think you gotta
keep sending it out. I've sent it to everyone. Oh, to everyone
you've matched with? I will be honest, this is taking
longer than I thought it would. I'm gonna look at
our other cards. Lumia has responded. Oh, great. She says she would
make a TikTok. ""Would you mind calling me
and explaining it better?"" Absolutely.
Absolutely. (pecking dial tone) Hello?
Hello. Before we do anything,
is it okay if we film this call? We just wanna make
sure it's okay. Sure.
Okay. Okay, hi. My name is Ben. This is Adam.
Hi, I'm Adam. If you spread misinformation
about our friend Brian by making a TikTok
lying about him... Because we asked
you to do that, we will have debauched you by making you
do something bad. Technically.
Technically. And that will allow us to
claim the state of Michigan. And we know
this sounds insane. We know this sounds
insane and we're very sorry. Honestly, I was like, I'm not
gonna lie, but I don't mind doing it. Yes. Thanks for being incredible.
Thank you. This would help us so much.
It would help us so much. So all you have to do is,
on any social media platform, just say the thing
that we sent you. Gimme a second.
Okay. Okay, you are the best. We appreciate it so much. Oh hey— this number. Oh yeah, we just got it.
Oh, we got it. Oh, incredible! Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
You are the best. You've just gotten us Michigan! Yes! Good luck, guys. Thank you, bye!
Bye! Alright, let's watch the TikTok. Brian McManus from
Real Engineering is not Irish. It's actually all an act. He's English. Yes!
Ha-haa! Yeah! That— Alright, that is
Michigan claimed baby. That is a woman debauched. Alright, now that we have seduced and debauched
an unmarried woman... It's time to draw a new card. Here's the deck. Okay. Our next card is to
forge great American art. I don't know how close
we'd be to any museums. But we can do that
in a lot of places. I think that we should
start driving to O'Hare. Okay.
And figure it out on the way. Okay, we're gonna
head towards O'Hare, and we're gonna
just figure out where we're going
next on the way. Alright, Brian, we have
15 minutes until we board. Let's make a plan for what
we do at the other end. Yeah, do we wanna
look into stealing Texas? I think trying to steal Texas
is too risky, just 'cause... we wouldn't know what states
they're gonna go to next. Where are they gonna
go after Texas? New Mexico would make
a lot of sense. Colorado would make
a lot of sense. Arizona would make
a lot of sense. Utah would make
a lot of sense. Yeah, yeah. Let's very quickly
explain our plan. Okay. So, Las Vegas... is right here in
this part of Nevada. There's a very good flight
for us to Las Vegas that gets us in before
the end of tonight. Vegas is very close
to both Utah, Arizona, and also kind of California. All of which are big states
and all of which are states that we have challenges
that we can complete in. So we are going to fly
to Las Vegas, and hopefully... that should win us the game if we can execute on
everything properly tomorrow. You ready for this? Are you ready for it? Oh yeah.
You dirty leprechaun. Okay, no time to explain. No time to explain. But we've got a plan,
and if the plan pans out, this could be what
wins us the game. Okay, we need to get out. Through the magic of voiceover,
there's now time to explain. Here's the plan. First off, we claim California
as quickly as possible with the one card that
might be fast enough: find a four-leaf clover while
dressed as a leprechaun. But it's a risk. There's a Spirit Halloween
near the airport, which we can get to
on scooters, but we'll need the luck of
the Irish if we're gonna find a four-leaf clover in time. In time for what you ask? Well, if we can claim
California fast enough, we can sprint back to the airport to get a flight to Las Vegas
before the rest period. Then tomorrow morning,
we can drink soup in a helicopter as it takes off from
Las Vegas, Nevada, then ride in that helicopter
to the Grand Canyon in Arizona, allowing us to knock out
both of these cards, claim Nevada and Arizona, and get four power-ups before
the morning's even over. But none of it's possible if we
don't find the clover in time to make our flight to Vegas, which leaves in just 80 minutes. I should have changed
into shorts in a (bleep) bag. I'm not tired. I'm (bleep) too hot!
I'm not wearing shorts. Let's go, let's go, let's go!
My balls are hot! Step one... We're recording, right?
Yeah. Step one, find scooters. We gotta go this way because
they're not allowed within LAX, but we looked at the map already,
and there are scooters there. The next 30 minutes
are make or break. Okay, goodbye to the Chevy Tahoe. Okay, got the scooter. I'm not sure whether we'll
be able to film on these, 'cause they're already
skitchy enough as they are. Hopefully Brian has one. Where is it, Sam? Where is it? Here, how about you
stay with the scooters? I'll go in here. Take my bag. It should just be a minute. I'm so sweaty. Excuse me.
Hi. Do you know if you
have a leprechaun costume? I have not seen a
leprechaun costume here. Okay.
I haven't. I'll look around, thank you. This line... Sam just texted me saying
that the line is really long. I told him to tell him
that his son is dying, and that he needs a leprechaun
costume before he dies. Got it?
Okay. They didn't exactly have
a leprechaun costume, I asked. But they have this. (wheezes) So you want me to
be the leprechaun? Yes.
Okay. Did you get a whip? I did not get a whip, Brian. I'm very glad I'm not
degrading myself by... letting down my entire country
by dressing up as a leprechaun. Gotta hurry up, Sam. Oh, we do, Brian? Yeah.
Is there a rush? Oh, I didn't know that, Brian.
Thanks for letting me know. (bleep) hell. I don't see a single clover, Sam. There's not a single
clover in that grass. There, there, there. Are they clovers? Those are clovers for sure. So psychotic. Here's one. Oh,
I found one. I found one. Is that four? Oh my (bleep)! That is actually a— I did not think
we were gonna get it. Look at that.
That is 100% four— Count it, count it,
count it, count it. Look, wait. Oh, is it just, no! One. (bleep)
That's not. (wheezes) Keep going. Wait, keep looking there.
Those were good ones though. This one, this one, this one. Is it? No, that's three again. These ones are
such little (bleep) Who wrote this—
Wait, wait! Look at this. What do you think?
I think that's one. It's got four things on it. We need to leave in
like five minutes. ♪ We look like lunatics ♪ Oh, oh! That is 100%. Oh wait. Now,
is that a clover? Yeah. Brian, you can't crush
our ticket to victory. That's four leaves. I say we call 'em, Sam. Are we sure
that's a clover? No, but it's four leaves
and it's among clovers. Should we call Ben and
Adam to see if we can judge? Yeah. The adrenaline. Our flight—
(bleep) pick up! Let's take defined photos. We'll send it to them for
secondary adjudication. Brian, hold your hand steady. Trying to. Okay. Here, we will send these
to Ben and Adam for secondary adjudication. We provisionally have California. Provisionally. We are sending this for
secondary adjudication to have it verified by them. We believe we have done it. I hope we've done it. I really hope we've done it. Let's go to the airport.
We've got a flight to catch. (grumbling) We're gonna make this through
the power of positive thinking, right? By the power of the
(bleep) bald eagle, I'm gonna win this (bleep) game. I think they're on a plane,
but I texted them the photos. I just wanna figure out
is California's ours! I'm gonna say it's ours. Oh, there they are.
There they are. They're calling us. You look at the photos? Did you look at the photos? We are attempting
to load the photos. Keep running, keep running. That kind of looks like—
That— yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll accept that.
That's a four leaf clover. I see four leaves. Yeah yeah, I'll accept that. They say they're accepting it. Yes! We (bleep) did it, Sam. California's ours!
Holy (bleep) We are so (bleep) ready.
California! California. Okay. That's a big ol' state
you got there. California. Alright. Okay, bye guys. We gotta go. Love you. Bye!
Oh my god, Sam. It's the power of the bald eagle.
We (bleep) did it, buddy. It's the power of the bald eagle. I can't believe we pulled that off. I'm gonna have to
change T-shirts. I really hope I'm not sitting
next to you on the plane this time. We're gonna do this, Brian. Can you see how
disappointed Adam was? We're (bleep) animals, Sam!
We're gods among men! Adam gave a really
disappointed, ""Oh."" What did you drop? Oh, it's your mic! I'm sorry, Graham. Okay, so this completely
changes our plans. We believe that we can claim
Nevada before they can. I'm guessing they're
headed to Nevada. But they can't be
anywhere close. They couldn't have
flown in anywhere close. Like they're probably in LA or... I don't think that
they can beat us there. I'd be very surprised if they could. We can do forge great American
art 22 minutes from the airport. We're gonna have to really hustle. We can hopefully pull that
off before the rest period. The problem is if we don't
pull it off before the rest period, the gallery will be closed at 5 am
Pacific when the game restarts. So we'll be in trouble there. But then we've gotta
claim Arizona immediately, so that we can battle
for California. I think that's the obvious move. Yeah. In terms of things
we could do in Arizona... We don't have any perfect options. Not a lot of great options. I mean, honestly... Probably either shoot a bullseye... Or we could go to
the Grand Canyon. But it's a little far and
it's in the wrong direction. But one thing we can do is
we still have two power-ups. We can swap cards with
them, which will— We're going to. Which will hopefully screw them and get us something
that we can do quickly. It's getting interesting. I (bleep) love the LAX speedrun. Nice, look at that. That's a gloriously short
security line. Unbelievable job. Great, we don't need
to board yet, wait. They're still boarding, but
we can draw another card. And we have a power-up. So let's draw a card and then decide
whether we wanna use a power-up. I pull it. Let's see. Make s'mores over an open fire.
That's easy, that's easy. Yeah, I think we have to—
Yeah, that's easy, okay, great. I think we should try to disrupt
their plans with a power-up, 'cause we'll get them for
sure tomorrow morning, right? Okay, so I think
we need to give them ship this card and build a snowman. Yeah. Okay, let me notify them. We want to get the cards pulled. 'Cause we could trip 'em right now.
Yeah. We might actually win this. Okay, we've been informed
that they want to swap with us. The thing is, we're just
gonna swap right back, so... Okay, they have given us... Alright, fair enough. Ship this card and build a snowman. Yeah. We can't do those things. Yeah, fair enough. They send? Yeah, go sky diving. Touch both oceans. Touch both oceans. Forge American art's pretty easy. Top tier carnival
we gave them earlier. Clean—
Clean a national park. Shoot a bullseye.
Spell help on an island. Let's take spell help on an island,
forge American arts. We can do either of those
pretty much anywhere. So, forge art, spell help? Okay. Alright, they have chosen to steal
spell help and forge art. So let's immediately swap back. No, I want them to
make a decision based on what they
think they have. Let's give 'em 15 minutes, and then we'll swap back. What do you wanna give them? I think we should
give them the oceans. Oceans and give them... I want to keep snowman if
we wanted to go to Alaska. Yeah. Snowman one's— I'll give 'em oceans and
I'll give them back ship the card. Yeah. Okay, we have just
landed in Las Vegas, so it is time to inform
these dopes that we are swapping
right back. You'll receive
touch both oceans... and mail— and ship this card. If we do this swap and then
we don't manage to forge the art,
that'd be pretty bad. We really just need to get
off this plane quickly. Their cards are: ineffectively
advertise in a small town, make s'mores, helicopter,
Grand Canyon, build raft. Okay.
Helicopter... There's a helicopter.
There's a helicopter. From Vegas to the Grand Canyon. Yeah, that's true. Grand Canyon.
We can go to the Grand Canyon. We would get two power-ups.
That might be useful later. The question is just, I think
they're gonna be racing for Arizona too,
and we want back art. I mean, do we want the
islands one or not? I think we want it
just to take it from them. Just to take it from them? Yeah, 'cause clearly they
wanted it for some reason. So just take back the
two that they stole. They taxied in great time. They did. Seven minutes. Less than that, six minutes.
That was amazing. The thing we are attempting
to do in Las Vegas before the end of the day is forge great American art.
Thank you. We just need to find
art supplies before we get to the
gallery that we found that has a painting from
an artist on our list. I said, we haven't
been able to confirm what's on display at the gallery, but they keep saying that
they have things like that, and that they have had stuff from
the artists we need in the past, so. Just keep your eyes peeled. Do you guys sell any crayons
or colored pencils or markers? No markers, no. No, okay. Thank you. Okay, let's try here. Giant highlighters. Oh, beautiful. Yep. There's no one here. Hello? There's no one here. Okay, we gotta go.
Okay, okay. Wait, wait. Nail polish. That's basically, that's paint. That counts.
That is paint. Nail polish counts. Let's get three
different nail polishes. Okay, here's a red. This is... Get a black and white. The canvas can be
anything though. The canvas can be anything. Canvas can be whatever we want. And the canvas can
be a newspaper. Buy a newspaper? Oh wait. Oh, never mind. Alright. Thank you. Ground transportation
is this way, buddy. This way?
Yeah. Where's Uber pickup? Shuttle buses, limousine. Awesome. Oh my god. You all right, buddy?
Oh, I'm soaked. Okay. Well, we just gotta find the place. So we're looking for the
Martin Lawrence... Gallery.
Gallery. Very big map. Martin Lawrence Galleries is
by the Cheesecake Factory. So this way. This way. This way, then left. This is absolutely nuts. Martin Lawrence Galleries. Who's this by? I'm almost certain—
This is Andy Warhol, right here. Mao, 1972. Okay we—
Alright, Andy Warhol is on the list. How are you?
Good, how are you? Good. Is it okay if we draw
a picture of one of these? Draw it in a little sketchbook. Great, incredible. Okay, this is our canvas. This piece of paper here,
we have to cover 75% of it. ""Belle is wondering
what her gift is. Draw what gift you
would like to get."" I would like to get the
state of Nevada... by drawing Mao. Yeah, we gotta leave
the lips open, so... you know, give us
some space there. Yeah. You want to draw some? Yeah, yeah, here. I gotta say, this is
really coming together. He's got a very pretty eye. You've given him a very pretty eye. I feel like I'm nailing this. I mean, I just wanna say
this is better than I thought we were gonna do. I mean, this is really bad. But I thought we
were gonna do worse. Yeah, get him some more hair.
Really fill it in. You've made Mao
look balder than he was. Alright, 15 seconds,
finishing touches. We're gonna get these
little black dots on the side. They're very sort of faint lines. Because this is a forgery,
you know, it's gotta be a... It has to be really precise. Yeah, it's gotta be unmistakable. Right. It's 6:41. That's time. I mean, look, I will be honest. That's better than I thought. A lot better than I
thought we would do. I'm extremely pleased. We got a video. Okay, we playing it?
Yeah. Okay.
Get in a good spot. Okay.
See where the... Are you recording?
Hang on. Hello, gentlemen. We come to you from the
wonderful state of Nevada. (bleep)
Nevada. Sin— Wait, no.
I can't say Sin City. Oh, that is so bad.
It's pretty clear that we're in Vegas. The silver state.
The silver state. I think it's the silver state. If we get, we can
challenge it tomorrow. That's a really good point.
That would be great. If we do successfully challenge it,
then we'll have wasted their time. Mhm. The new card is... Go ahead. Ooh.
Sunken town. Skip a stone under a sunken town. Over a sunken town. Here's the thing, here's an
interesting thing about America, is we have this weird tendency
to keep flooding towns and turning them into lakes, of which there are many
across this great nation. We should just situate ourselves
in a place that would be convenient to be tomorrow. Let's just go to where
an Uber could pick us up. So yeah, we do the soup challenge
in Arizona in the helicopter. Yeah. And then... Come back and challenge.
Come back, challenge. That's a good plan. That's not— I really want to claim a state
back through a battle challenge. That would be fun.
That would be fun. And we'll be coming
back to Nevada anyway, so it'll be no extra time for us. And if we get those two— And they would get
super frustrated. So that's assuming that they don't
manage to battle challenge first. Okay, well it is almost 7 pm. We have the great state
of Nevada now. And we've just come
up with a plan... that we think guarantees
that we will win. If we execute on the plan that
we have just formed for tomorrow, there is no way
we could possibly lose. I was thinking like
spill some soup onto my shirt, and then suck off my shirt. Because that would count.
It says any amount of— You're such a (bleep)
filthy leprechaun. Well, it would work. ""Get the soup on my
(bleep) jacket!"" Do you have a better idea? We could do syringe—
Anyway, it's 7 pm. So we'll see you in 10 hours. Syringe in the pocket? I don't think they'll
let you on with a syringe. We'll see you in 10 hours at
the exit of security, right? Sure. Bye.
Bye! Alright, it is 5 am. Good morning, Adam.
Good morning, Ben. I am about to call an
Uber right now to... America's treasure... the Grand Canyon. I think we have a
busy morning out of us. Yeah, I'm actually
really looking forward to it. Yeah. Get to go to Grand Canyon.
I've never been to it. You can't spoil it! It's five, let's go!
I know! And an Uber to bring
us to the Grand Canyon will be here in seven minutes. So here's the dealeo. Perhaps... Sam and Brian can get
to Arizona faster. Perhaps not. If we get Arizona, then we're
in a very safe position. Right, because we could challenge
California and get the area bonus. Right? I think we would get the area bonus
with California, I'm pretty sure. I'm almost certain.
Yeah. If they get Arizona before us,
we have a backup plan that we think
will be quite effective. But hopefully it
won't have to come to that. Yeah. So we're going to
a 24-hour mini-mart. I went through the pictures on Google,
on the Google Maps listing, and I found, in one of
those photos, soup. Yes. So at least the photo is four
years old, so I hope that they're— That's such a
hilarious thing to do. I hope their inventory
hasn't changed, but at least four years ago,
this place stocked soup, so I really hope they do now. Good morning. How are you?
I'm fine. Looks like we're gonna
be in here for a while. You ever driven anyone to
the Grand Canyon before? Nope, first time.
(laughs) Alright. Soup. Classic tomato.
Sipping soup. We will use new containers.
They very specifically say no drinking on the aircraft. So I think we—
People say a lot of— It's a very small aircraft, so. They're not gonna, it's not— But they could notice
and be like, ""What the (bleep) are you doing?""
Something super— I've snuck bigger things
into more strict places. If they have like a
flexible pouch, like a Ribe— You don't have Ribena
in this country. But you know, like a Capri Sun
with the little twisty things. You can pour the soup in that
and put in your gooch. But Brian... But there's gonna be
other people sitting right next to us
on the thing. Who cares? I don't want to get
left at the Grand Canyon. They're not gonna leave
us at the Grand Canyon. I don't know, is it— ""Stop, evil."" Real quick, 'cause we
technically didn't do this. We're using a power-up to
unlock the border between Nevada and Arizona, which we're about to
cross right now. We're going over the
Colorado River. You... you can't tell. It's pitch black outside. Gum's a normal thing
to have in your pocket. And this has like a closeable top. That's genius. Thank you, Brian. Soup acquired. Here, show them the soup. Campbell's finest. Oh, it's tomato soup. I knew this going in,
but then once I saw it... I realize how much
I hate tomato soup. You just need a shooter. 5 am in Vegas. Two white boys, nerdy white boys
filling gum canisters with soup. There you go, Brian. It's your ticket to salvation. You're going in my gooch. I am not convinced this
won't spill in my gooch. Just for extra safety... it says that we can
consume any amount of soup. You're gonna spill
some on your shirt. I'm gonna spill some
on my shirt. So I can suck it off
my shirt mid flight... if it becomes necessary. That is demonic, Sam. Brian, I don't
wanna lose Arizona. We're a couple of
(bleep) soup heads here. You're literally pouring
soup on your shirt. This is my job, Brian. (giggling) You see that? That's so (bleep) gross! Brian, we have to! Do you wanna risk it, Brian? Do you wanna risk?
I just think it's hilarious. The plan is, I just go like,
you can see the little morsels. I just go like...
(giggling) Alright Brian, if something
goes wrong with the helicopter, you know who to call, right? 11-time gold—
What does that mean? He's won gold, Brian.
Don't question it. ""Hello, my name is Brian."" Minor crisis.
We're at the wrong place. They didn't tell us when
we called yesterday that it leaves from the
Boulder City Airport. It's the same company,
but it leaves from the Boulder City location, which is— Uber's almost here.
It should be a 30 minute drive. So as soon as we take off
and we're south of Lake Mead, we need to do it in case
they're going for Arizona too. ...six. You guys ready to
head on out? Oh yeah. This is gorgeous. Getting close.
We're close. Look, the sun's up now.
The sun's up. It's beautiful out here... in that Mojave Desert. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Jet Lag season four finale
is out right now on Nebula! Will Ben and Adam hold
onto their victory? Will Sam and Brian—
Wait, that's me. Will Brian and me—
Will Brian and I— Will Brian and I claw our
way back to victory? Find out right now by watching
the season finale on Nebula. If you're not already a
Nebula subscriber, how do I get access to this? Well, Nebula is a creator-founded
and creator-run streaming site, started by myself and
a bunch of my friends, and we banded together to
basically create the best place for the content that we make. How do we do that? We, for example,
got rid of an algorithm, so we don't have perverse incentives
about just getting the most views, rather than making the
most impactful content. We also have like this
different economic model, where we are not ad funded,
we are subscription funded. So again, that improves
our incentives. So we're not just trying
to get the most views. Again, the most impactful
views, not the most views. So we have all sorts of original
content on there, you know, beyond just Jet Lag one
week early and ad free. We have originals by us. We have originals by, you know,
Brian from Real Engineering, you know, our guest this season, Joseph from RealLifeLore,
our guest from season two, and and like literally
150 other creators. So it's this amazing streaming
site with stuff that you can't find anywhere else. You know, this kind of stuff that
you watch on YouTube, but better, because it's better funded
and not kind of sullied by the perverse incentives of
an ad-supported platform. And what's crazy about
Nebula is, you know, they do have a direct
way to sign up, but they also have this bundle
deal with Curiosity Stream. And Curiosity Stream is this
other streaming site that does non-fiction shows and documentaries. So they have a bundle deal
with them, where if you sign up for any subscription for
Curiosity Stream at our link, curiositystream.com/jetlag, they just throw in Nebula
subscription for free. And their subscriptions are actually
cheaper than Nebula subscriptions. So you pay less and get two
streaming sites instead of one. So it works out to like $1.25
a month or something like that. I'll put the real number on
screen, but like something crazily low when you pay annually. And that's two streaming sites. So like, it's literally less than
the cost of like a third of a latte per month for two streaming sites
in every episode of Jet Lag early. It's a crazy deal,
and Curiosity Stream, they have tons of good stuff too. Like our documentary that we
made for them, it's called The Colorado Problem:
A River in the Red, really good. It's about, you know, how the
American West is going through like a massive drought and
is gonna implode or whatever. Very dramatic, anyways. So but the main reason
you want to sign up right now is because again, Jet Lag
season four, episode five, this finale. It's there right now.
You can watch it right now. You don't have to wait until next
week when it comes out on YouTube. So head to our link,
curiositystream.com/jetlag to sign up today or
click the button on screen. And also huge thank you
if you do because that's literally how we pay for this. Obviously very expensive show by
all those subscribers over there. And we really are grateful to them. So head over."

to claim the most states. You're watching episode three, so go watch the first two episodes
if you don't want spoilers, or just keep watching if
you're freaky like that. Right now, the score
is three to seven, but Brian and I have a
plan to make a comeback. At the end of the game,
the team that's claimed the most area gets
an extra two points. If we can lock that bonus down, we have a pretty good
chance to win the game. So we're heading to the pretty
big state of Tennessee next, with a plan to continue on to
the very big state of Texas. Along the way, we can always try
to steal Adam and Ben's states by claiming two adjoining
states and declaring a battle. And speaking of battles,
we're in one right now, trying to defend our
state of Massachusetts by photographing the
most birds in 15 minutes. A battle we have to win,
where we've just had our first stroke of good luck. There, Brian, more,
more, more, there. Go, go, go, go, go. Okay, there's
one, two, three. Is that a bird over there? In the water?
I can't see. There's more coming. One, two, three. The gods have
smiled upon us, Sam. Where are the other ones?
There's more. Oh, there, keep coming.
Keep going. Four, five, six, seven. But I think we just suddenly
got up to 60 or something. Surely they can't have
more than, what, we have 35. Yeah, we got so many birds. Oh, there's a bunch more. One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20. I'm so happy, Sam. This field came in clutch. I love bird watching. Birds, birds, birds, birds. 2:28, okay.
Okay, okay, time's up. Thank god for
your youthful eyes. Oh, here's Adam. Hey boys.
Hello. Hello, gentlemen. We have to double check
some of the pictures, but we believe we have
approximately 35 birds. (vocal fry chuckle)
You lose. How many do you have?
Oh, we have... Approximately, like... We're at this field. 150, 200. Oh god, okay. Okay, well that's... That is more than 35. I don't think we have
to tally our birds then. And...
And we got a bald eagle. A bald (bleep) eagle.
We got a bald eagle. Ca-caw! I mean, that's,
that's pretty good, okay. Well (bleep), okay. Well done, boys. You keep the state... You will keep the state
of Massachusetts, and it is now locked. Thank god.
Yeah! We finally got something. A bit of luck went our way. We did it. Alright, you
guys needed that. Oh, look, there's two
birds in front of us now. (bleep) Because we had, we
were like watching flocks for like ten minutes.
Yeah, there was— Okay, yeah, yeah, we get it. You got a lot of birds.
Okay, we have to go now. Well, that sucks. So now... New York is vulnerable
if they get Vermont. If New York goes, then other
states become vulnerable as well. So this is quite bad. Choo-choo! Brian, that's the train
to Vermont that we decided not to get on, I think. Good. We made the right call. I'm positive that they
could beat us to Vermont. We are instead sticking with
the plan and going to Chicago. Chicago's this way? Chicago's this way. Hi, does this go to terminal C? Yes.
Okay, thank you. So we have an hour and a half
until the flight to Nashville. I'm booking that, right?
It was like 175 bucks each. Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
this luck turns fast, 'cause we wasted their
time with Massachusetts. (bleep) It's right there! Oh my god, this (bleep) wasp! This is the first flight that we've taken in a
long time for this show. Long time, yeah.
No flights last season. No flights last season. First flight of this
season for us at least. Look, it's Jet Lag. We promised you some jets. So here we go.
We're back at an airport. So what does that mean? They have New York,
Connecticut, Rhode Island. They have six to our three. We can pull, we can come
back from that, yeah. 7-2 was gonna be, I think, impossible to come back from. Yeah, especially if we get
the area bonus. and we're gonna be, yeah,
like you said, Nashville, it's gonna be easy
to get to Texas. So anyway, I think our
Uber's almost here. So let's get in that, get to the
airport, and get on our flight. Made it through security. Ben seems to have
mostly sobered up. Mostly. Adam, I have a little treat
for you for the flight. It's your Pez. Ah, thanks buddy. That's a fun little
treat for the flight. America, Sam. We just met him.
Ca-caw! Ca-caw. Let us take you on
a magical journey from Boston to Chicago.
Tale as old as time. It's a journey
that people dream of. Yeah. To go from Boston, Massachusetts
to Chicago, Illinois. This is really some
fantastical content right here. Bye now! Alright, we have
two hours and 20 minutes. It's a 90 minute drive. We gotta get the rental car. We can pick any of these.
The most American one. The Hemi?
Yeah. These are
terrible cars to drive. Whatever. This one?
American— yeah. You sure it's the best one?
Yeah. I'm not gonna lie. You do not smell amazing. Do I just smell of BO? Yeah. You need more headroom? ♪ Life na-na highway ♪ ♪ I wanna na-n-it ♪ It's copyrighted music.
It's copyrighted music, Sam. Not my cover of it. That is far too
accurate of a cover for it to not get copyright. Oh, thank you, Brian. (imitates revving) We're literally going, let's see... The entire length,
we're just on this road. So directions are not needed. 101 miles on this road. That's where Buc-ee's live. To Exit 320.
Along boring roads. An hour and a half. That will give us 25 minutes
to start coming back this way. Well, yeah, but we
need purchase stuff too. (bleep) Buc-ee's! Bussy— Buc-ee's! Buc-ee's!
82 miles away. Welcome to Chicago. Welcome to Canada,
according to T-Mobile. Not only did they not
challenge New York while we were in the air, they
didn't even claim Vermont. Or another state. Or any other states, so... What are they doing? Buc-ee's! 27 miles, Brian! Is it up bussys? No, it's Buc-ee's—! Look. Look. Look. Buc-ee's. Buc-ee's.
Look. Look. Look.
I'm trying to look. Buc-ee! Brisket. Beavers. Bathrooms? Buc-ee's!
Next exit. Buc-ee's. Exit now.
Buc-ee's. Exit now. Right here? Oh, Jesus.
Slow down. (imitating vroom)
(bleep) Slow down, Sam! Welcome to sunny,
beautiful Illinois. We have 45 minutes
until the rest period starts. And in that time, we really need to go pick
up our Chevy from Avis. It's kinda hard to explain. It's part of like a
scavenger hunt thing. And I specifically,
it has to be a Chevy. Because we are going to do the
drive a Chevy to a levee card. If we can't pick it up and
get outta the airport before the rest period starts... then I don't know if we're gonna
be able to pick it up tomorrow. I forgot how
confusing and big— Oh what the hell? What's going on here? That's so many gas pumps! Oh, this is so wholesome
and totally not problematic in the slightest. I wonder—
Holy (bleep) Like I don't, I'm not
even sure this camera's getting the scale of this. There is... Unbelievable. Like 20 gas stations
worth of pumps here. This is like
four times larger than the next largest
gas station I've ever seen. And get this. This is one of the things
Texans are most proud of. Here.
Travel to any Buc-ee's store. Spend at least a hundred dollars. You may exceed this
number by at most $10. Money does not come outta
your travel budget, great. It smells like brisket everywhere. Make the selections quickly. Remember, we have to keep
anything that we buy. Ooh. This goes hard. Oh, that's
actually really cool. Yeah. It's 20 bucks.
I'm totally getting that. I'm getting it,
how can I get one too? Nine bucks, so what are we at? $60. 27 minutes. Bit of a line there at Avis. These are awesome.
I want one of these. How much is it? It's 13 bucks. Oh, hell yeah. Absolutely. The bib. You have to bring the, you
have to wear the bib then. Hey. You all doing okay? Oh, yep. Thank you very much. Let's put as much merch as
we can on in the next... in the next minute. Alright, we've
just received a video. We've received
a video from them. After a long time. It looks like there's a
Buc-ee's in the background. That doesn't look
like Vermont to me. Hello.
Hey guys. Coming to you from
the great state of... Tennessee.
Tennessee. Tennessee.
I didn't know there were Buc-ee's in Tennessee.
Tennessee? Tennessee's interesting. We hope you had a great
evening at Boston Logan Airport. Yeah, it looked like
you had a great time. Yeah and we're gonna,
we're gonna go get some some dinner, I think.
Mhm. We're done for the day. Bye!
Bye! Tennessee? I did not
Tennessee? expect Tennessee. Why... Why would they go to Tennessee? 18 minutes until
the rest period. Wanna see if we can
make the most of it? Yep. So I think we should go
ahead and pull a card, see if that impacts
our plans for tomorrow. Like whether we wanna go
south to Chattanooga or over to Nashville. Right?
Yeah. Okay, same as
before, top card. Yep. Mhm.
Ready? Ineffectively advertise
Jet Lag: The Game. Go to the smallest town in your
state and put up a single poster advertising Jet Lag: The Game. The poster does not need to
be well made, but it must give the town sufficient
information to watch the channel. See the Smallest Town
list for reference. That's all right.
That's doable. We can do that in any state. Do we want to drive
towards Nashville right now, or do we want to drive
towards Chattanooga? I would say towards Nashville. We will want to probably
go to Texas or something. Yeah, I think so. Alright, let's make 15
minutes of progress towards there, and then we can talk
about the plan for tomorrow. Thanks very much. Alright, we have like... 10 minutes until the day's over,
and we have to get the car. F15. That's J. It should be F after G, right? E, F, G?
Oh, F. F? Oh, F. F15. No. That is not a Chevy. (hollow sigh) Okay, so tomorrow morning,
we're currently driving back towards Nashville, assuming that
we'd probably grab a flight. We're just not really
sure to where yet. We know we can go to Texas. I'm not confident that we could
get a flight until like 10. And I think the next
flight to Texas after that was not until like 11. So we'd kind of lose an hour. But we'll have time to research
all of this in the morning. I'm gonna take this exit. I think this will be our spot. There's people up here. Okay. Worst case scenario,
I guess we just cancel it. This is a very stupid problem, but we had to rent this car
as part of a scavenger hunt that we're doing, and specifically
we have to be driving a Chevy. Are there any Chevrolets
that we can get instead, of any make or model? In Quincy-eight, alright? Incredible,
thank you so much. No problem. Alright, well,
that was sorted out much faster than I expected. That was kind of a miracle. That was incredible. Look for Q. R. I forget how the alphabet goes. Yes! That's a Chevy, baby. Alright, let's hurry, hurry, hurry. How long do we have? We have seven minutes. Okay. This is gonna be our spot. Right here? Yeah, around this
disused gas station. How about that?
This is spooky, Sam. This is really spooky. Okay, well, on the map, this
is marked as Septic Solutions. (shivering) (hissing sigh) We might be about to die. It's 8 pm.
We are— We did not make
it to the McDonald's. We're at this intersection.
We're at this intersection. We will figure out a way to be
exactly here at 8 am tomorrow. 7 am. 7 am, 7 am, sorry. 7 am Central, 8 am Eastern. Ugh. It is 7 am. We are at the exact same
intersection we were at 8 pm last night. And we are headed to... the levee. The way that this card works,
we have to be in a Chevy, we have to drive up to a levee,
and we have to eat pie. Yes. We bought pie at
the Boston Logan Airport. Boston Cream Pie secured. We actually bought
two kinds of pie, 'cause one of them
turns out wasn't really pie. And now I also
have key lime pie. Just so that no one
can get mad at me. Yeah, we bought
Boston cream pie, which it turns out is a cake. So we also have,
what, it's key lime pie? Right, well, I got rid
of the Boston cream pie, so now we only have
key lime pie. We have some key lime pie. That's definitely a pie. Sam just learned how to
rev the engine before starting. I had to teach him, 'cause he's
only ever driven electric cars. Okay, go, go, go, go. Wait, don't die,
don't die, don't die. We haven't heard
from them like since our battle challenge yesterday. So we have no idea where in
the country they could be. I am worried they're in Texas. If we don't get Texas,
we have to go to Alaska, 'cause we're so far behind. And Alaska will take so much
time that it will give them time to get states down here. And at that point we've lost. Oh my god. Ben, that's the
levee right there. That's the famed
levee from the song. Not really. Okay.
That's a levee though. That's the levee.
Levee seven. There was a sign. If anyone doesn't know,
this card is a reference to the song ""American Pie"", where they took a Chevy to a
levee, but the levee was dry. Which actually,
just by the way, a levee isn't a body
of water, it's a wall. So you actually want
your levee to be dry. That actually is good. We took a Chevy
to the levee... And the levee... is dry. The levee is dry,
that's true. This pie traveled in my backpack
from the Boston Airport, and it did not travel well, baby. It's still pie. Bon appetit. My stomach is usually
pretty unsettled in the morning, and there's nothing better
than eating a whole slice of key lime pie for that. I don't even
like key lime pie. No, me neither. If they didn't try to go to Texas,
they made the wrong move. Which I don't— they're
both smart lads. I don't think they would've. Yeah, and they know
about the area bonus. That makes me think
we should go to Vegas. Oh, I got a red thing. I think that's from
the Boston cream pie that was in here before. Soon we will own the
great state of Illinois. Afterwards, we still
have our rental car. We still have our Chevy. And we have three power-ups.
And we have three power-ups. We can use one of those
power-ups to unlock the border
with Indiana, which is right nearby,
and drive our Chevy right into Indiana... and do a challenge
and claim Indiana. The one we are
thinking of doing is go to the most beautiful
place in Indiana, which is what? Indiana Dunes National Park. And that is not too far
from where we are right now. This is the last bite. We have claimed Illinois! Alright, let's go call Sam
and Brian from the Chevy, 'cause it's so cold here. I want to go
away from the levee. These are trippy
(bleep) clouds. Maybe it's not clouds. Maybe it's like a
toxic gas thing. I'm starting to wonder. We just got a video
from Ben and Adam. We need that info, but
that also meant that they claimed a state very quickly. Yeah.
42 minutes in. Which like, I thought
we'd established what was going to happen.
Probably, but... We're pretty sure they're
in a car, they're driving. We just watch it?
Yeah. Hello gentlemen. We come to you from
the great state of... Illinois, good
morning from Illinois. It's very cold
here in Illinois. That is... I imagine, much colder
than it is in Tennessee, or wherever it is
that you are. That is great news. What do we want to tell them? Suck it. I think Ben put
it best— suck it. When did Ben get so mean? Since yeah. It's Dark Ben. Dark Ben is here.
Dark Ben. I'm honestly, I'm
here for team Dark Ben. I think that is good, because
That's great. that means we can get Texas, and then we can
probably get to Vegas, which gets us a big state.
We can get to California. We can speedrun
all of these today. Yeah, I think so. The only bad news is that,
we talked about this yesterday. They're in an area with a bunch
of close bordering states. Yeah. And some public
transit between them. So they're probably gonna be
able to get like Wisconsin and... Let 'em have it. And Michigan and all that. Let them have it. But we're gonna have
a great head start for the area about us.
Yeah. Now it is time
to pull another card. Our next card is... ...whatever it says on this. Shoot a bullseye. Okay, shoot a bullseye. This is interesting,
it's a pretty flexible one. We can do it in a lot of places. Let's officially use our
power-up to unlock the border between Illinois and Indiana. We are on our way to
Indiana Dunes National Park. Here we go. At the airport. Look, planes. Ooh (bleep) Look at that. I love planes.
I like planes too. Almost as much as I love trains. I think I love planes more. You love planes
more than trains? Yeah. I'm gonna send the
""not just bikes"" hit squat after you. They won't be able to go very
fast, 'cause they'll be on bikes. They'll be on bikes. We're getting Texas.
Texas is huge. Texas could win us the game. And it puts pressure
under them to... To waste time to go to Alaska.
Yeah. It's the right play. if we didn't get,
if they were getting, if they got Texas this morning, we'd be having a
very different morning. They're gonna be getting
all these little boi states, you know, like Wisconsin. Welcome to Indiana. Crossroads of America. Crossroads of America, baby. Here's a question. Where do you think that Sam
and Brian are headed next? They're in the middle,
dead middle of Tennessee. I'm putting in
my guess as Kentucky. Kentucky's not a bad guess. Because Kentucky
touches Illinois. They're behind.
So if they want to win, they need to start attempting
to steal some of our states. I think that's their only chance. Yeah. I don't think that they
can outrun us at this point. I think they have to
go for some steals. And right now they're
not winning the area bonus. No, we're winning
the area bonus. Alright, Southwest,
south terminal, left. Ready to go home? For two hours? Is it even two hours? Probably an hour in Austin,
and an hour in the airport. Yeah.
Yeah. What is that ball? Someone in the comments,
tell me what that ball does. You guys are smarter. Don't tell people
in comments, ""Tell me what that ball does."" Tell me what that ball does. There's a big— People are gonna
take that the wrong way. This guy makes sexy teeth. What? Indiana Dunes.
We are almost there. We're almost to
the state park. National park.
The national park. The national park. National Park, but we're not
gonna do the National Parks card. We're gonna do most
beautiful place, 'cause I wanna save the
National Parks card. There are 63 national parks, and we're now getting to the
regions where a lot of them are. So I think it gives
us more flexibility. We have arrived at
the Visitors Center for the Indiana Dunes National Park. Can I just get
a National Parks pass? Thanks very much. Have a nice day.
You too. Okay, well
we've got our passes. The people said that we
should go see Mount Baldy. Hopefully it'll be very pretty. I think the drive
will be very scenic, but we have to come with
things we don't like about it. Yeah, we're gonna say some
very mean things about Mount Baldy. And we're sorry that
we have to do that, but that's what the card says. That's what the card says. And we didn't— well,
we wrote the card, but... We wrote the card. There's the sign. We're entering
the national park. Dunes, dunes, dunes, dunes,
dunes, dunes, dunes, dunes, dunes, dunes, dunes, dunes! Alright, I mean,
we're in the national park, so I'll go ahead
and say the first thing that I hate about the
national park is that it's seemingly very hard
to get to the part that's cool. Like this is a national
park right now, and it's just very normal looking roads,
and it has been for a while. Unimpressed. But that's okay.
That's number one. Mount Baldy is up ahead. Is this our left? Is it this? No, no. Keep going. You're sure?
Yes, I'm sure. There's a big sign
pointing to Mount Baldy. We're back in the national park.
We took a wrong turn. We almost went somewhere that
we were not allowed to go. Oh? Now we're talking. I'm seeing a big dune. Ooh, that looks
pretty dune-y to me. Okay. Trail to beach,
or summit. Okay. Okay. Actually, this is a
great place to show... the second main thing
we have to say about it, which is you see these trees
getting eaten by Mount Baldy? So the woman at the visitor
center, she said that Mount Baldy moves a lot, and it's always
moving all around, and that they're worried that it's
gonna crush these buildings here, because it's already
eating these trees. So... That's the second thing
we hate about the most beautiful place
in Indiana. Yeah. Here we go, trail to beach. I've never had to hike
to get to a beach. This is pretty nice. Yeah, this is a lovely trail. Show everyone the trail. Very peaceful. Dunes, dunes, dunes,
dunes, dunes, dunes! Seems we are
approaching the lake, Ben. Oh, here we go. Dunes, dunes, dunes, dunes. Oh, oh, I think this
is gonna be a cool view. Cool view alert! Oh, and it is cool! Got a nice little
nuclear plant over there. Very classy. I gotta admit, these
dunes are cooler. These dunes are cooler
than I expected, I'll be honest. But we're not supposed to
say something nice about 'em. Yeah, yeah. Okay, here. Third thing don't like
about the national park. There's a giant power
plant in the background. Yeah, that sucks. Pretty cool.
What do you have to say? I've never seen
Lake Michigan before. And I think it's beautiful. And I think it should be
upgraded to the ocean. You think Lake Michigan
should get upgraded to be being allowed to
be an ocean? Well, let's call Sam and Brian. No answer.
No answer. Let's send him a video. Let's get back to the car,
let's pull another card, and let's figure out if
we want to go to Michigan. Yeah. If you have oversized
items, please check— They just called. We have to go
upstairs for Uber. Okay.
These stairs. Oh, we have video. You're recording, right?
Hell yeah. Hello, Sam and Brian. As you can by the tropical
beach that we are sending you this video from,
we are in the great state of... Indiana! Indiana. Great, okay. The crossroads
of the country. And the... well, what? What is it?
The Hoosier— I'm not watching the rest
of video, we don't have time. We're about to get the area bonus. Our new card is... (laughs uproariously) That's gonna be a tough one. Go sky diving. That's gonna be a tough one. Put it into the hand.
Wow. Put it into the hand. Now we have to decide
what we're gonna do next. We're not too far
from Michigan. We could use another
power-up to unlock the border
with Michigan. So in terms of things
we could do in Michigan, I mean, maybe we
could go sky diving. Maybe. There is a law from
Crime Spree in the state of Michigan. It is... seduce and debauch
an unmarried woman. So we might have to
get creative about how to achieve that. Yeah.
Mhm. Came all the way here for it. Thank you very much.
Have a good one. Alright, we've made it
to the Promised Land. The Promised Land of In-N-Out. I feel like someone
I know is gonna see me. Eat at In-N-Out. Travel to
any In-N-Out restaurant. Both team members must consume the
entirety of at least one menu item. Do you know what you want? No, I don't. Well hurry up,
'cause we gotta be quick. I'll just get a cheeseburger. Hi, can we get
two cheeseburgers? Two cheeseburgers?
Yep. Okay, so we're gonna go
ahead and we're gonna contact the judge from Crime Spree,
where this map originates, and we're gonna ask him... what he would think was sufficient. Sufficient to seduce
and debauch a woman. Seduce and debauch a woman. Let's see if he answers. Oh hey, buddy! Hey! What's up dogs?
You running from the law? What are you up to? So JT, we're playing a game. One of the cards is we have
to break one of the unbroken laws from Crime Spree. Can you pull up the
exact statute, Ben? Okay, seducing and debauching
an unmarried woman is illegal. Any man who shall seduce and
debauch any unmarried woman shall be guilty of a felony.
Alright. So ins— how—
I guess the question is, what would you consider
debauching? Now, debauching is not
a word I typically use in my day-to-day life, so that's a— Sure. So debauch is defined as... Corrupting the moral.
Corrupting the moral purity of. So we were thinking
if we could just get them to sin in any way... Would that count? I would say so,
but the caveat there is it would have to be new to them,
to besmirch their purity. Okay, so you're saying
we have to get them to commit a sin they
haven't committed before? Correct. Okay. Hmm. I'm making this
difficult for you boys. No, that's fair.
No, that's fair. Alright, thanks buddy. Bye JT. Bye, boys.
Good luck. Okay. Let's, I think,
let's go to Michigan. We're only like
17 minutes from. Yeah, we're like
17 minutes from Michigan. We are gonna use another
state unlock power-up. We are now unlocking the border
between Indiana and Michigan. We're gonna drive to Michigan,
gonna get on the dating apps, and we'll see how well we
can do in terms of getting... an unmarried woman to commit a sin
that she has not committed before. We will see you in Michigan. Okay, so... We're still waiting for our
burgers, but basically we don't know what our next part
is, but we need to decide between Vegas and California. Because that's like
the two good options. 371. That's us. Okay, you ready to
absolutely demolish this? Yes. Wanna race?
We can talk and eat. So... The thing about California is that
it would really help solidify the area bonus, because it's massive. Mhm. Nevada would too,
Nevada's very big, but California's the
second largest state. And forcing them, making
it clearer that we have the area bonus advantage would
force them to be a little bit more aggressive and maybe
go for Alaska for example, which would waste
a ton of their time. They would need to use like all
of tomorrow to get to Alaska. I mean, I'm pretty sure if we
went to Vegas and literally just walked into a bunch of
the different helicopter tour places, there are a bunch
of them, they all do like 15 minute flights and just saying,
what's your next one available? Mhm. We would need
to acquire a soup. In getting a soup— oh,
I need to eat, you talk. I wanted to finish first. You want papa to help you eat? Eat, you need to finish. What is a bad thing we could
make someone do on Tinder? This is someone who doesn't
know us, doesn't trust us. Right. We also don't wanna be creepy. Like we don't wanna— No, but we have to get
someone to do something bad that they've never done before. And we need proof
that they'd do it. What are sins? What are examples of sins? Can we look that up? Could we have them commit
arson at a very small level? At a very small level? Could we have
someone commit fraud? Could they steal
at a very small level? Could have them say a curse word
that they've never said before. But JT said
cursing was a cop out. Most people have
never scammed someone. Ah-huh. Could they scam us? Could they scam?
Does that count? Well, I think the problem
is if they do something bad to us,
we want them to do it. So I don't know if it's a sin. Could we, maybe if they
can't do something bad to us, maybe they could do
something bad to Sam and Brian. Yeah, that would work. Could they like spread
misinformation about them? They could spread
misinformation about Sam and Brian on social media. Because I'm sure that
they've lied before, but like spreading social... Spreading misinformation, right? Like slandering someone. So that's definitely. Slander is definitely a sin. Ooh, okay! We're good, this works.
I think this works. Can you look up, just for like
a joke on camera, can you look up the area of Cal— the area of Texas
and get like the number exactly. So I can be like,
""We just got Texas,"" and I'll be like,
""Brian, you're from here. Do you happen to know
how big Texas is?"" And then you give like
the precise number. 695,663 kilometers squared. We need miles. Do we?
We're in America. I'm not American though. 268,597. Hundred. 268 thousand. 268,597. 268... 597. 268, 597. You calling them right now? Yeah. Here, look up. Let's go outside and
call the Uber too. Still nothing
from Sam and Brian. Not a word! We don't know
where they're going. What could they be doing? We don't know
what their plan is. I mean... Look, Sam is the type of
person that has a plan always. But I just like struggle... Oh. Brian just called. Uh-oh. Okay. Well, never mind. Oh. Oh, here he is. Hello gentleman. Oh hey, Ben. Hello. Hey guys. We just had a delicious
meal at some local burger establishment in... That's a state that has
268,597 square miles area. Known as... Alaska. What, where are they? Texas!
Texas! Where are you?! What state are you in?! I can't hear you.
I can't hear you. Texas is ours, mother-(bleep)! What state are you in?
California? Texas. Texas.
Texas. Texas, Texas, okay. You're screwed.
Texas. Good bye!
Bye. Bye! Well, that puts them in
the lead for the area bonus. They're presumably
going for the area bonus, and that might put them... Yeah, I mean, if we
don't get Alaska. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, so now, it was nine to four. Now it's nine to five. They're in the lead for the
area bonus, so it's like... Nine to seven. Provisionally, it's
nine to seven right now. Oh. Yeah. They're catching up. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Okay, so in all these ad reads, I always talk about why you
should totally sign up for Nebula, 'cause you can watch every
single episode of Jet Lag one week early and ad free.
And while that's totally still true, you totally still should
sign up for Nebula for that. Clearly you haven't
been convinced yet, so I'm gonna give you 150
other reasons to sign up, and it's all of these faces and
logos and everything behind me. 'Cause these are all of the
other creators on Nebula, and they're all making
really fantastic stuff. For example, here's Joseph. You know, our season
two guest, RealLifeLore. He makes this awesome series
called Modern Conflicts. It goes into how these modern
wars and battles have gone down, really getting nitty gritty,
showing actual footage, doing all this stuff that
you can't do on YouTube because of their advertising
guidelines and stuff. There's also Battle of Britain.
This is a series by Brian. You might recognize him
from this season of Jet Lag. It's about the Battle of Britain. It's just about the highest
production value thing I've ever seen come out
of an internet creator. It's awesome. It's amazing.
You should totally watch it. Night of the Coconut,
this one's also awesome. It's by Patrick Willems.
He's a film creator. He makes fantastic stuff, and in
this, it's really hard to describe. It's about a interdimensional,
genocidal coconut. That's all you need to know. That, and the fact that it's
like genuinely fantastic. I went to the premiere. I'd never really watched this channel
before that, but this was so much fun. I totally recommend it,
even if you have zero idea what the Patrick Willems
universe is about. Oh, here's another new one: That Time When
with Anita Sarkeesian. It's about moments when history
and pop culture have converged. Also, super high production value. I mean, we're also adding
new creators all the time. For example, that's Johnny Harris. He's new on Nebula. He's posting videos
right now early on Nebula. It's awesome. And you know what makes
all this worth it even more is the best way to sign up,
because there's this crazy deal. Honestly, I'm surprised
that it is a deal, but when you go to
Curiosity Stream, Curiosity Stream is partnered with
Nebula to offer a bundle deal. So it's actually cheaper to go to
Curiosity Stream and sign up for one of their
subscriptions, which are less. And when you go to our link,
curiositystream.com/jetlag, they throw in a Nebula
subscription for free. So you pay less and get more. And crazily, they're running
a holiday deal right now, which is 42% off, which comes out to
less than $12 a year. So that's less than
a dollar a month, when you put it on a monthly
basis, for two streaming sites, including, every single
episode of Jet Lag early, all of this stuff by all these
other awesome creators, and then all of Curiosity Stream, where they have loads of top quality
shows and documentaries. We've even made some for them.
For example, we made The Colorado Problem:
A River in the Red. We made that documentary
on location. We drove from the top to the
bottom of the Colorado River, talking about why it's drying up, and the politics involved,
and all the drama. There's a lot of drama.
It's a good doc, I think. Anyways, it's a crazy good deal, and you can go to
curiositystream.com/jetlag, or click the button on screen. It's 42% off right now
for the holidays. It's the lowest price I've ever seen,
so if you've ever thought about it, the time is now to sign up. So head over there and also
thanks in advance your support, 'cause quite literally
this is what funds Jet Lag. Okay, bye!"

The production has offset 10x its estimated carbon impact through The Wren climate portfolio: https://www.wren.co/profile/wendoverproductions","idiCtICGlCA","Welcome back to episode two
of our race to get the most states. The rules are simple: the team that visits and
claims the most US states by doing a challenge from their
hand of cards in four days wins. Eight hours into day one,
Ben and Adam have claimed New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and Delaware. Brian and I have DC,
Virginia, and Maryland, but maybe not for long. If a team has claimed
two states bordering one of their opponent's states, they can enter the enemy
territory and declare a battle to steal their state, which is exactly what Ben and
Adam just did in Maryland. The battle is...
The battle is... Okay, here are the
rules of our first battle. At the end of 15 minutes,
the team to find a license plate from a state or country furthest
from their current location wins. The distance is measured from the
location the plate was spotted to the closest point in
that state or country. Find the most
foreign license plate. Oh, we're in a
good spot for this. There's a garage. Ho-ho, we're in a very
good spot for this, Ben! Let's go! Good luck, gentlemen.
Good luck, gentlemen. Okay, time to go. Oh, it's time,
time, time, time... Okay.
So we're at a train station. It's a hub. It's a travel hub.
Yeah. Seems like it
would be a good place. What is that? That's Maryland. Okay, Maryland, Maryland. Know where that is,
that's Maryland. That's all Maryland. Can we go down
into the parking garage? Is there a parking garage? I think... there is? If there's a parking
garage, let's do that. Well, yes.
Okay, that's a lot of cars. Great. That was—
Retail and residential. Residential only.
I feel like retail's gonna have— Yeah, residential will
be all around here. Here we go, here we go. Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania. New Jersey, a little further. Virginia, Virginia. Virginia. Got a Colorado. Colorado? Yeah, that's pretty good.
Okay. That's almost the
whole other side of the US. Delaware. Delaware. Virginia. Whoa, Virginia. We need like a California,
I mean California's... I mean Washington, I guess
Washington State would be... Oh, don't tell me that's—
Oh, no, no. Oh, damn it. I thought that was
the Alaska one, but I remember Virginia has a
""no step on snek"" plate too. Remember, we need to keep a mental
note of where the good ones are. Ooh, California.
California, yes. That's great.
Ooh, there's Washington. Texas here. We already got Washington. I have seen plenty of Hawaiian
plates in continental US, 'cause sometimes like,
you know, people ship their cars back and forth. Alaska too. So there's still a shot that we
can get better than Washington. Well, that's great.
That was a really strong start. Maryland. Iowa.
Iowa. That's Maryland. Maryland, Maryland.
Oh, it is? Something feels very illegal
about just walking around, just filming license plates. Actually, I think our luck
might have turned. Turns out they're further to
both Washington and California. So if they manage to get
either, we're screwed. Oh, I just know they
found a California one. There's so many Californians. California. Oh, California. I mean, come on. It's not gonna
be better than that. Let's hope. If this person comes
for their car, we have to implore
them to not leave. Okay. Alright, it's time.
Here they are. Present to us your plate. What is that?
What is that? I think it's a California. I can't see. Oh (bleep). You guys also
found a California? Found a California? But you're closer to
California aren't you? Yeah, we know. We have the same,
but you're closer. God damnit.
Fine, bye, I hate you. Alright, well... The state of Maryland is ours. A battle well fought. A battle well fought,
gentlemen. (silly grumbling) I hate this. Yeah.
I hate this game. I'm not listening to them. Ben and Adam, I'm striking. We've claimed
the state of Maryland. We have battled them for it
valiantly, and we have succeeded. Ahh. But now, we have nine minutes
to make our train to New York. We have, you know,
we're busy people. We got places to be.
We got states to claim. We're going back to New York. But what do we do now? Because we only have
two and a half hours left. So I don't know if we
can get on a flight. Maybe we fly to New York,
back to New York? Right now? Yeah, 'cause then we're
right next to Connecticut. You might be wondering why and
how we want to claim Connecticut. Well, let me take you back
to a magical time called two hours ago. Why would we go
northeast, when we have all these
cards in the west? If we get Connecticut
and Massachusetts, we can start a battle
challenge on New York, which is where we'd wanna go anyway
to get flights from Connecticut. So the only two that
we can do easily are: win a prize from a claw
machine, and ship this card. They're gonna start a battle
challenge soon on Maryland. Almost guaranteed.
Yeah, I think so. And we don't wanna be
on a flight during that. Yeah. So delaying ourselves a bit
by wasting time shipping the card. Yeah.
Kind of a good thing? I think so. So should we do that?
I think so. UPS.
UPS Store. My cover story is my
colleague Brian McManus is currently traveling in New Haven, and I have to overnight
documents to him, right? They're not gonna
question what we're sending. Just be like it's a
(bleep) playing card that we're shipping for fun. Where are we shipping it to? I'm thinking New Haven,
'cause that's right on the Amtrak line in Connecticut. Okay, back to the present,
where we're on a train to the airport in a desperate
attempt to fly as close to New Haven, Connecticut
as we can. Shoutout to Lockheed Martin. I love Lockheed Martin. They really help us
spread democracy. Well, if you're wondering why
we're having difficulties, it's 'cause of this. Literally, almost every
single flight is delayed. Delayed, delayed, delayed,
delayed, delayed, delayed. So there's no flight
back up north tonight. And I mean, there aren't
other forms of transit that could take
someone north, right? We're hopping on a train back
to New York, where we started, and that'll get in right
as the day is ending. The logic there
is basically that... New England is
still wide open. It would be insane to leave
those states unclaimed. So we're gonna start tomorrow
by trying to claim New England, so Connecticut, Rhode Island,
Massachusetts, and then maybe New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine. But those states are
really sticky to get to, so we'll have to see
about that. So like, yeah.
Where would be useful? Birmingham, not useful. Austin, you wanna go home? A little bit. Albany, leave at six? That's in New York. And then it's not easy to get to. It's not easy to get to
Connecticut from there. I don't think
we have anything. I think we're hunkering
down 'til tomorrow. This sucks so hard. I guess let's just plan
for tomorrow. And that is a
beautiful looking map. Not looking
good for them, is it? Not looking good for them. Okay, so Brian and
I spend like an hour researching and planning, with a focus on getting
to New Haven, Connecticut, where we shipped our card. The bottom line was there
were no good options. Instead, we had to go with the
least bad option, which was... The one to Windsor Locks Airport, which is 40 minutes away
from New Haven. We can get to New Haven
by like 11:15. Is that the move? I think so. I think our main priority
now has to be to get another card in our hands. It gives us more options. And I don't think they'll
be going to Connecticut. We're feeling pretty
good about tomorrow. Yep, we can get to Connecticut
as early as what, 10:30 or so?
Yeah. So... Sam has a lot of
ground to make up, so good luck to him. Let's see. We gotta get a shuttle. We gotta get hyped
for the shuttle. Back of the bus,
'cause I'm a cool kid. You can't come back here. You can't hang with us. One time, I sat at
the back of the bus. And a kid that was younger
than me choked me. Alright.
I'm very masculine. Do you see this beard? That's all testosterone. Okay. Welcome back to New York. Alright,
step away this way. Okay. Okay, so there's a train
tomorrow morning at 8:03 that we really want to take. But it leaves from Grand Central,
and we're in Penn Station. So we have 15 minutes to get from here to there. Huh? Perfect timing. Alright, one stop. Thanks. Alright, we have 10 minutes. So we just gotta basically
pick our spot for tomorrow. How about this bench? I like this bench.
Right next to— Ooh, this is not
a comfortable bench. Five minutes! This is Grand Central Terminal. Two minutes to get
to the main area. Wait, no. Oh no, Ben. This is the basement,
this is the basement. Here we go. Okay. Welcome to the main terminal
of Grand Central Station. What time is it, Sam? Is it 8 pm yet? Yes. Yes.
Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me.
It's eight. We've made it, Brian. Is it actually 8 pm,
or are you just saying that for the camera?
No, it's actually 8 pm. It says it's five to eight
on my watch, you (bleep) liar. The New Haven Line
departure board is right here. Tomorrow we'll be standing right
in front of this departure board, waiting to find out what track
we're supposed to get on. But yes, let's go to sleep. I'm operating on
two hours' sleep. I need— Yeah, I'm exhausted, and
I had a full night's sleep. So I can't imagine
how exhausted you are. Graphic, go to sleep. Bye-bye.
Bye. Now, it's the rest period. At 8 pm Eastern Standard Time, both teams stop exactly
where they are, go somewhere to sleep,
and then return to that exact spot at 8 am Eastern the next day. In this game, the rest period
gets one hour shorter every day. So tomorrow it'll start
at 9 pm Eastern, then 10 pm, then 11 pm. And now through the
magic of editing, it's 8 am the next day. Okay, it's 8 am. Our train is on track one. It's this way, it's this way.
It's this way. Oh, we can't miss this train. I don't know what that means. It's time,
it's time, it's eight. Give me your mic. Unfortunately it
is on the lower level, which is less than ideal. 109. Okay, that wasn't too far. So the second we
get to Connecticut, second we land,
we really have to rush. Because one thing I
was realizing that I think we just failed to
properly consider yesterday is the possibility that they
just got on a train north. If they did that, they could
get to Connecticut early, but then they're down to the luck
of the draw of a challenge. So I think it could be quite close. Train's still here. That's good.
Woo. This is one ugly train. Let's go.
Yeah, they're ugly. Our aircraft is there,
but it's now showing like 20 minutes delayed leaving,
which is not amazing. Nothing is going our way. Anyway, it's not that bad. As long as it doesn't
get delayed more. Well, like 20 minutes
could be the difference between them getting it and... It could, yeah. We'll see. Okay, we have made it onto the
train to New Haven, Connecticut. It's about a two hour train. It's a slow train. Yeah, we had a very exciting
first three minutes of the day, and now we're gonna
have a very boring... Two hours.
Two hours. Hopefully Sam and
Brian will do something interesting in this time. Yep, well hopefully it's
not claiming New England. Right, that would be bad. That would be
very bad for us. We are respecting the
weirdest roadside attraction. Which in Connecticut
is the Pez Visitor Center. So, the rules are as follows. We're gonna go to our
Uber as I explain them. Visit the weirdest roadside
attraction in your state. You must stand directly in front
of it and salute for the entire duration of the national anthem. If it is possible to gain
admission to the attraction, you must do so and spend
at least 15 minutes there. And it is possible to gain
admission to this attraction. So we are gonna have to
spend 15 minutes there. Now, there's a train at
10:40 that we would really love to take to Providence. I think it's gonna be
really hard to make that, but it's... possible.
It's possible. Hurry, hurry, hurry, inside. We have to spend
fifteen minutes inside. Oh shoot, visitor
center's around this. No one's ever been
in this much of a hurry to get to the Pez Center. Okay, we're inside. So we can leave—
It's 10:12. We can leave the
Pez Center at 10:27. Thank you.
Wonderful. It's a big Pez. This rocks. Oh my god, that is Sam. Isn't that him?
That's Sam. Brian reminds me of Popeye. Okay, that's interesting. Oh my god, they're making Pez. Look! It's magical. Ben, look,
there's, that's Pez! This rocks. This freaking rocks. You wanna get
a bucket of Pez? No, I want a dispenser of Pez. That's the whole point. Pez, Pez, Pez. You look amazing as Pez. I'm Pez. Would you buy this? Looks very phallic. Alright, well,
now I'm leaving. If they don't claim
Connecticut, then we're fine. We just continue with the plan. If they do claim Connecticut, I think the move then... we're not far from the
border of Massachusetts. So we could go quickly claim
Massachusetts, probably before they could
get to Massachusetts. The problem is that we cannot take
an Uber over the border without a power-up,
which we don't have. So we'd have to take public transit.
Luckily, I just checked, there's a train leaving 35 minutes
from a 10 minute Uber away. And that train is not frequent. It's across the
border, Springfield. We're allowed to leave in
one minute, but we still have to stand in front of the
Pez museum for the full length of the national anthem
while saluting it. And then we have
twelve minutes to get 13 minutes away
and get on a train. That might not happen. Alright, let's... Alright, go, go, go, go, go.
salute the Pez Center. Beautiful. Hi. It's time to draw
a new card. Weirdest roadside attraction
goes out of the hand. Phew, and we get a power up. And our new card is... Break a law from Crime Spree. This one requires
some explanation. On Nebula, the pilot season of Jet Lag: The Game
is called Crime Spree, where we put the 33 weirdest
laws in the country on a map, and Sam went around
breaking them. So we have to find one of the laws that
Sam didn't break. Yeah.
And break it. So we'll need to... We'll need to
look at that map. Need to look into that. 10:40. It's still here. Track two, track two. Did it leave? Is the train to Boston,
is it not here yet? Okay, awesome. Ohh... we made it.
We made it. Buy the tickets,
buy the tickets. Oh my god, okay. Oh, here's the call.
Okay, remember, no reactions. Hey guys. Hey guys, we've claimed
the great state of Connecticut. Congrats. Okay, we gotta go, bye. Bye. (bleep) So that's terrible. So we need to get
that train, right? How did they get here? Don't worry about it. We need to rush.
Are we getting that train? Yeah, yeah. That is terrible. I'm like genuinely
pissed off now. This is every single thing
is just not going our way. Yeah, we couldn't— I think we would've
got it if wasn't for the delay on the flight as well. I assume we'll just have
to do the claw machine one. We'll have to find a claw machine. It's the only one we can do. Yeah, so... whatever. And that sucks 'cause now our card
is waiting for us in New Haven. Just abandoned. And until we get
that card back, not only can we no
longer claim that card, now we only have six
card slots in our hand. So... And then the other problem
is they're probably going into Rhode Island next. You ordering the Uber?
Yeah, there's nothing yet. They're probably going
to Rhode Island next. And once they have
Rhode Island, they can battle challenge
Massachusetts. They still haven't claimed
anything since 3 pm yesterday. So that's what, five... That's eight and a half
hours of game time. Yep.
Nothing. They've been dropping
the ball, and better yet, we've been having a fun
conversation with the conductor of this train,
who doesn't wanna be on video, because he would be
having too much fun. And he gave us coffee. He gave us coffee for free. So we're in Windsor. We're going to Springfield. Oh wait, Springfield does
have service to Vermont. That could be important, 'cause
Vermont and Massachusetts, that borders New York. Guys, sorry
about all this delay. What? Somebody up there
doesn't like it. Look, it's Dunkin'. That's how you know
we're in Massachusetts. By the way, welcome to
Massachusetts, Brian. Thanks. I've never
been here before. I always wanted to go to MIT. But it's too stupid. Hey, for Sam?
Hey, how's it going? This is WNNZ-AM 640, Westfield. Alright, we're looking
for something called Round1. Not Forever 21. We gotta be quick. Yes, we do. I already see claw
machines, that's great. We need to get a card. Come on, baby. We're allowed as many times— Oh (bleep)
I thought I had it. Okay, that was bad. Come on. Go on. Yes! Yus!
You got it? I'm so happy, Sam. I've never felt so
jubilant in my life. They got a video.
They've sent us a video. Hey boys!
Where are they? Coming to you
from our latest state. We've got a new mascot. Ma-Ma- Massa— You need to work
on that stutter buddy. You're supposed
to say the second bit. —chusetts. —chusetts.
—chusetts. —chusetts. Oh.  Oh.
Massachusetts, it's ours. That's... We can go battle 'em
if we get Rhode Island. Oh!
Which is right here. So we gotta get off the train. Yeah, well, we're gonna get—
Oh, wait, wait, wait. They're gonna go to Vermont
and try to challenge New York. Well, that's why we
have to steal Massachusetts. Okay, we have to—
we're gonna get Rhode Island as quickly as possible.
Yep. And then we— In case we haven't
said what we're gonna do, we're gonna get drunk.
We are gonna run off the train. I'm gonna get drunk
as fast as possible. And then we are gonna
get on the 1 pm Acela continuing on to Boston. So we are gonna have,
I think, 35 minutes to get to a bar,
get Ben drunk, get back to the train
station, and get on a train. So good luck to us. Brian, we need to be
quick in our decision making. Take advantage of that W. Take the top card.
Oh please god. It's gotta be good,
it's gotta be good. Build a raft, oh my god. Well, it's doable
anywhere, which is good. And it gets us a star,
which is good. We do need the star. I think overall
that's pretty decent. But yeah, okay.
Let's just research like crazy. Do you think going to
Rhode Island makes sense? Up we go. Oh, it's so pretty now. Oh, it is.
Show everybody. It got pretty in Prov-town! God, a terrible shot.
Get a better shot. You film what you wanna film. What's it called? Harry's Bar and Burger. Is it that? Yeah, it's that. Oh, great, okay. There's a cow with
horns outside of it. Howdy. Bar table's there. Oh bar, I just need to... take four shots of whatever
liquor you recommend as quickly as possible. Okay, so despite claiming
Massachusetts in literally two minutes, we then spent about a half
hour researching and planning, and we were once again left
with zero good options and two bad ones. The train line up to Vermont
only runs once a day. Luckily it stops in Springfield
in less than two hours. But then there's the problem of
getting out of Vermont, especially if we'd then be trying to get
into New York to challenge it. We could use a power-up
to drive there, but we don't have any
power-up tokens right now. Second, the nearest airport
is back in Hartford, but because they own
Connecticut, not us, we'd have to wait an hour
for a train to get in. But there's a pretty well-timed
flight from there to Nashville, Tennessee where we
could knock out the Buc-ee's card, but we basically have to
cede the Northeast. So, what to do? What's your thinking? Flight to Nashville. I just don't see any other, yeah,
I don't think going up north is, with the cards we have
going up north. Yeah, I think I agree. We've seen how difficult
it is just by being here, which is in a big city and we'd
be going to smaller cities. And we're doubling down
on the problem we currently have. I think at this stage,
we are absolutely going to need the area bonus. Okay, so this is the last
major game element we haven't told you about yet:
the area bonus. Whichever team claims
the greatest area gets an additional two points
at the end of the game. It's a big deal. And the way things are going,
we're gonna need that bonus if we want a shot to win. Yeah, but what we really
need for that is Texas. Yeah, which is why I'm
saying, like as long as we're moving in that direction.
Yeah. There's flights like every
hour from Nashville to like... There are In-N-Outs in Texas. I think I agree. I think that we should cut
our losses in the Northeast, and fly down to Nashville. Should we go for it? I think so. Alright, well let's
get back to the Amtrak station then, I guess. Thank you very much. Shot number one.
I'm gonna get silly. I'm drinking the branded
water from our Uber driver. He has his own brand of water. He does? That's awesome. Thanks. Alright. We got it.
We're making great time. Three. (wheeze)
You okay, you okay? Alright, alright, last one.
Here you go. Alright, we've claimed the
state of Rhode Island, folks. Okay, it's okay, it's okay. Let's get outta here. I just think we
need to get outta here. I think—
Oh wait, I'm getting a call. That's weird. You okay? Yeah, it was so good. Hello, gentlemen.
We are now the proud owners of the great state of
Rhode Island, baby! Ben doesn't look too great. He's drunk again, isn't he? Ben's gonna be fine. Shut the (bleep) up.
I'll kill you. We're gonna... attack you. Ben, can you walk
in a straight line? Shut up. Hang up the phone. I don't wanna see him anymore. Recite the alphabet
backwards, please. Good luck hanging
on to Massachusetts! He's definitely drunk.
Yeah. Brian, are you excited
for more trains? I'm hungry and I'm losing. Alright, you did that
so fast that we can actually just walk back
to the train station. That's gonna be good. Because I don't know
that you could run right now. While we walk back
to the train station, it's time to draw a new card! Oh god. Oh, buddy, okay.
I got them. Alright, you
wanna draw the top one? That's it.
What is it? That's it. What is it? Spell ""help"" in
rocks on an island. We can find an island. I bet we could
find an island. Travel to a landmass officially
designated as an island. Anywhere on the island, legibly spell the word ""help"" using
rocks collected from the island. I like this card. Islands aren't that hard to get to. For the most part. Alright, so what we're
gonna do now is... Here, come get in the frame. Our Amtrak conductor helped
us out and called Amtrak, and was able to split our ticket
across New Haven to Providence, and then Providence to Boston. And these are our special tickets. How you doing?
What is this? Thanks to... Mike and Leon. Thank you. I'm very drunk. I know, I know you are. Alright, I'm gonna
go get Ben a bagel. While I do that, I'm just
gonna hand Ben the camera, and I'm gonna see what he does. Number one, Victory Royale. Yeah, Fortnite, it's time
to get down, get down. Ten kills on the board
right now. Just wiped out Tomato Town. That's what— Alright, we gotta
head to track two, buddy. We gotta go now, come on. How you doing? Hi. I fought the Acela. Okay, so... we're 20 minutes out
from Boston. We're gonna declare
the battle now, so that it starts in 30 minutes,
once we are in Boston, because we don't have a
lot of time to wait around, because we have to get
on a flight at 4. So we're gonna call them. I'm putting the
microphone on the camera. Hang on.
Are we recording? Hey. Gentlemen, we hereby
declare a battle in the great state of Massachusetts. I'm gonna (bleep) kill you. Good bye! Okay, well that was in
a way perfect timing, 'cause that came in
literally at 1:41, so exactly 30 minutes before
we'll get off this train. At least we'll
be able to compete. Yes. I'm doing so good, but
my hand is really dirty. I don't know how that happened. Welcome to Boston, buddy. What? Welcome to Boston, buddy. We're in Boston.
I hate Boston. We've already gone over this. I think it's the
worst city in America. Are we allowed to say that on—? Alright, so we're not
gonna be in an amazing spot for this battle challenge. They're gonna be
in downtown Boston. We're gonna be in the
middle of like nowhere. Basically, if we manage
to pull this off, it would be unbelievably lucky. If we don't— Which we have not
had a lot of luck with. Yeah, if we don't, we will
continue our streak of Ls, and we'll be even further behind. And we will leave the East
Coast with only two states. After two days. Yeah. That's not great. No. I mean, I definitely
would not characterize our current state
in the game as 'great'. There's nothing good
in this city except for the aquarium, which is okay. Okay, you gotta
delete your tweet. Ben did a tweet
saying he was drunk. Shut up! Now he has to delete it. Ben's drunk tweeting on
the train and giving us info, like confirming that he did
the drunk challenge and... This tweet has been deleted. Deleted a tweet. Have a good one.
Thank you. Thank you. Alright. They should call any second now. Alright. 2:11, call 'em. Hello.
Hey guys. Alright, gentlemen. I'm going to draw
the battle challenge. You prepared? Alright, are they
properly shuffled? They are properly shuffled. Ben, pull the top card.
What is it? Photograph the most birds. Photograph the most birds. You have 15 minutes. All photographed birds
must be clearly visible and must be actual birds. You cannot intentionally
photograph the same bird twice. Oh god. Photograph the
most birds, okay. It's raining and we're
in the middle of a city, so I'm not feeling
good about this. Bird. I mean, where would birds be? They're gonna be water or
in a city, but they're just gonna get all the
(bleep) pigeons. Yeah.
(bleep) Damn it. Okay, there's a bird right
here, right in front of us. I have photographed it.
You photographed it? Got it. One bird there. Got that bird. Let's keep looking. Look for birds like
perched on top of things. Oh!
Bird. Bird. Yep, yep, I got it for sure.
Got it? I mean, I don't
even see a single bird. Birds aren't even (bleep) real. Yeah, that's true. There's literally
not a bird in the sky. Oh, what the (bleep) I hear birds. Oh, wait, wait. Shh. I hear...
No, I hear them too. I hear them too.
Where are they? Birds. Okay, I got one. There's one right there. What if I kick the tree really hard?
No, no, no, no, no! How's there not a
single (bleep) bird? Literally not a single one. (angry groan) Where are you, little (bleep)? Boom, one! So that's nine birds. Oh, that bird. Oh, whoa, whoa! Bird. Got it, that's ten. We are so (bleep).
I've taken one picture of a bird. There's big bird, big bird there. Just make sure you're
really scanning these trees, so you don't miss any. What's your best bird call
to try to scare 'em away? Ca-caw! That didn't do it. This is hopeless. Ugh. I hate to be so pessimistic,
but I'm just being realistic. There's a bird!
Bird. Ack!
Bird alert. I don't have
a clear shot of it. Bird alert. Bird alert. Yeah, yeah.
I got it, I got it, I got it. Sixteen. Sixteen. I mean, we're doing
pretty good, I feel like. What are you at? One.
(scoffs) Oh, see if the dog
scares some birds. Oh, there's one. There's one.
Get it Brian. Get it, Brian. Get it. You got it?
Got it. You got it?
Got it. That's two. Nice job, Brian. Wait, there's a second. Oh, that's.
No, it's a leaf. False alarm. Hello, there's two pigeons. 18, 19, I got them. Oh, there's a bunch
of birds right there. Bird town. Oh, and I've got him
in the picture. That's 1, 2, 3, 4th.
Bird central. Oh, there's another one.
It's a big eagle. Oh, wow, geez, oh. That's a bald eagle. That should get
us extra points. That should totally get us—
That's a bald eagle. You see that?
Look at that. It's literally a bald eagle. Ca-caw! Got a god damn bald eagle. Anyway, don't
get too distracted. We should have... That is literally a bald eagle. It is literally a bald eagle,
but we need to keep going. Is that a bird or a cup? Oh, that's a bird. That's a bird.
Got it. What about that bird? Got it. I think that's like around 29. That's three, right? That's three.
I mean, the bald eagle should be worth...
(bleep) 50. This is brutal. (moaning sigh) We just cannot... I mean, at this point I'm wondering
if we're just (bleep) at this game. Let's hustle. Okay, I think
there's six more minutes. Okay, we have
six minutes left. (bleep) There, there, there.
Brian, there's a flock. Wait, there's so many over there. Get 'em, get 'em.
Where? Get 'em. In the sky,
in the sky, in the sky. Go, go, go, go, go.
There's so many, so many. Yes, Sam! Yes! 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. I count at least 35. This, we might have— Our luck might have just
finally changed, Brian. Caption+ by JS*

visit the most American states over the next four days,
and New York isn't claimed yet. So let's... Go, go, go, go, go! Okay, Brian, Brian. Ben, Ben, Ben! This way! This way, Ben! Okay, pull seven cards.
Pull the top seven cards. Oh my god, hurry up. We gotta draw seven cards. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Pull the cards, pull the cards. 1, 2, 3. 4, 5, 6, 7. Seven, okay, let's check them out. Okay, so the goal in
this game is simple: claim the most states
by the end of four days. Both teams just drew a hand
of seven challenge cards. In order to claim a state,
the team must go to the state and complete any one of those
seven challenges now in their hand. Once you claim a state,
it's yours. But there's a twist. In this game, one team can
attack another team's state by claiming two bordering states
and entering their opponent's territory to declare a battle... where both teams compete
in a special challenge drawn from the new Battle Deck. If the attacking team
wins the battle, they steal the state
and lock its ownership. There are more rules
and complications, but we'll explain them
once they're relevant. For now, the teams need to
look at their cards and start claiming some states. What are they?
Here are cards. Photograph... Praise the ugliest building. Sell something from a pawn shop. Respect the weirdest—
Clean up national— Phew, okay. We can go to the
ugliest building. We need to pick one.
Quickly, quickly, quickly. Go to Grand Canyon.
That's not possible. No, no. Ship this card, no.
Visit every Spirit Halloween, no. Eat and In-N-Out, no.
That's possible? Why not? Eat soup in a helicopter?
Oh, oh. Let's check Blade. The ugliest
building is close to here. It's that giant skyscraper that
all the billionaires live in. Oh, I hate that building.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What's it called?
What's it called? What's it called? 432 Park Avenue. Let's run.
That way's north? Okay, go north. Go north.
Or actually start by going... Aaah! Manhattan to Newark,
as soon as possible. Oh (bleep), oh. Why is it not working? Why are there no
helicopters available? So this is really bad for us. In playtesting, the
""Eat soup in a helicopter"" card has actually given teams
a huge head start in New York, because a company called
Blade has regular helicopters from Manhattan to Newark Airport. But none of them are
leaving today, because... It might be this weather.
The weather's kind of bad. Here, see the mist?
Oh yeah. Oh, that is so unlucky. What other ones do we have? There's not a whole lot there
that we can do at New York. High five at the highest point. Win a top-tier prize
at a carnival game. Go to the Grand Canyon. Ship this card.
Visit every Spirit Halloween. Oh, we're— these are really bad. What do we do? Okay. Cross, cross, cross. Alright, Ben, there's city bikes. Let's get a city bike. Okay, scan to unlock. Come on, come on, come on. Okay yeah, it's unlocked.
Let's go, baby. Come on, Ben! Maybe the Spirit Halloween one,
but we'll have to go up to Rhode Island or something. What is Spirit Halloween? We have to visit every
Spirit Halloween in the state. Is that like a store? You don't know Spirit Halloween? You have so much to learn
about America, Brian. There's so many red lights! Look, all the lights are red. Turn green, baby.
There we go. All greens. Let's keep pace, we got this. Oh, what if we went to DC? For the purposes of the game,
DC is considered a state. Alright, look, there's only a single
Spirit Halloween in Washington, DC. I feel like that's
our only play right now. I think Spirit Halloween... Oh yeah, Spirit Halloween
gets us a power-up, so we could use the power-up
to exchange our cards. Okay. And then work our way north. In addition to claiming states,
some more difficult challenges come with an extra reward:
Power-up Tokens. Challenges like this earn you one,
and the very hardest earn two. These tokens can be spent at any time
on one of the four power-ups in the shop: Border Unlock, Card Swap,
Card Shuffle, and Tracker. We'll explain more later, but just know
that if played at the right time, they can completely change
the course of the game. What's the fastest way
to get to Washington? Acela, train.
Okay. Well, we could look for
a flight, but I think train. So we should go to
Penn Station, 34th Street. So... that way. Alright, we're five blocks away. Okay, three blocks away! We're one block away.
No word from them yet. Really hoping that they're
not about to claim New York. Stromae is coming
to Madison Square Garden. Are you a Stromae fan, Brian? I am, I love Stromae. Oh hey. You are a Stromae fan?
Yeah. Oh, look who it is!
We should go to that concert. Two slim men. Two men, two slim men. Let's cross. Ben and Adam are probably
being so frantic right now. We're at 432 Park Avenue. Things that we like about it,
what does the card say? How many things do we like
about it do we have to say? I think, it's either three or five. I like that it floods a lot. I like that when the—
That's one. When the trash goes from the top, it moves so quickly that it
reaches terminal velocity, and it shakes all the
apartments below. That's very funny. I like that it uses this weird
workaround in zoning codes, so that it can be taller
than it should be able to be. Alright, that is New York claimed.
Let's call them. Okay. Brian, the news is not good. It is eighteen minutes
into the game, and we just got the message
that New York is— Hello gentlemen, we have just
claimed the beautiful state of New York, home to the greatest
city in the world, baby! Oh, home state advantage
is what I call that. Woo! Love that for us. Their videos are always very cryptic.
Have fun wherever you're going! I mean, we knew that
was gonna happen. But it happened
eighteen minutes in. I would like for the record
to show, to demonstrate that we got (bleep)-ed by our card. So (bleep)-ed.
And clearly they got super lucky. (angry grumble) Okay. Now that we've claimed New York,
that card gets discarded. We'll draw a new card into
our deck, and that card is... I don't know what it is.
I don't see it. File a Geodetic Mark
Recovery Form. That's a really good card.
It's a really good one. It's easy. I think
we should save that. Yeah. I mean, the real question right
now is, do we go for New Jersey, or do we go for Pennsylvania, or do we go for Connecticut? Basically, we can go north,
or we can go south. Somewhat counterintuitively,
you would think that the move is to obviously go straight north. It's actually hardish
to maneuver up north. Once you go past Boston,
and that main northeast regional line is ended,
it's really tough. I think that New England is
gonna be dealt with later in the game, like maybe at the end of today
or beginning of tomorrow. I kind of think that the
south is a better way to go. I think what we should do
is we should get on a train that will go through
New Jersey to Philadelphia. If we can— If they haven't
claimed New Jersey by then, then we could consider
getting New Jersey on our way. But otherwise, we'll be
going straight to Philly. Okay, so we need
to go to Penn Station. Penn Station.
Get on an Acela. There should be one at 9.
I bet we could make that. We've made it, Brian. Oh, is this where Penn Station is?
That's Penn Station, yeah. It's right around
Madison Square Garden. It's a little moist out, isn't it? It's a little bit moist.
A little bit moist, but it's— I'm also a little bit moist. You mean sweaty, right? Yes, sweaty.
Okay, just clarifying. Here, Sam. We've made it, it's 'To Trains'. It's the cousin of 2 Chainz,
you know. That's the stupidest joke
I've ever heard you tell. Thank you, Brian.
I love it. Push it firmly, all the way in. Penn Station. Will you take a photo
of me in the...? Yeah, just pose for a photo, Brian. Yep, pose, pose.
Nope, pose. I know it's a video.
(wheezing giggles) Brian, what time did you... Picnic style. What time did you
get to sleep last night? Like three hours ago. (giggles) Yeah. My flight got delayed, and I came in three hours
late, four hours late. And then a storm started and
we got delayed another hour. So I got into New York—
Did you ask for oat milk? I didn't ask for anything. This is a
World Trade Center bound... We need to go to
like Moynihan, right? Yeah. Okay yeah, we oughtta
get out of here, I think. Gonna be honest, Ben,
we don't have that much time. I know.
Eighteen minutes. But it's right here. Good thing about DC is we're
right next to Virginia and Maryland. Yeah.
So we can, in fact, we can even take the Metro
to Virginia and Maryland. Which means, that
leaves super frequently. And 'cause the difficulty
with state borders is we can't cross them in Ubers or rental
cars without having a power-up. This is another big rule. Teams aren't allowed to cross state
borders in Ubers or rental cars. And actually, we're not even
allowed to get within two miles of state borders in
Ubers or rental cars, which prevents us from
driving right up to the border and just walking across. We did this to incentivize
public transits, and also because a show
just about us driving rental cars around
would be boring. If we really need to cross a
state border in a car, we'll need to unlock the border
using the Border Unlock power-up. Otherwise, we need to find a way
to cross borders on public transit. So in a way, DC's actually... I mean, we can get to
three states pretty quickly. Yeah, we're gonna need
to rack them up quickly. I'm actually feeling
a little more confident. Assuming we get lucky
with our cards. What do you think Ben and
Adam are up to right now? There's every chance the world,
honestly, that they're on our train. Yeah, they could be
here right now. The new remodeled Moynihan Station,
and it's actually shockingly nice. Sexy as hell. Thank you, Kathy Hochul. I actually don't know that Kathy
can really take credit for this. Oh, there's some squeaky shoes. Oh yeah.
Listen to that squeak, baby. That way they know we're coming.
This is the content you crave. Wait, I just realized,
they might be on this train. It's perfectly likely. It's like very possible. I hadn't thought about that. Down this way. This, yeah, yeah, train hall. Let's see. 21, 51. Ben, Ben, Ben. Hey guys! Go, Brian. We're just talking. Ow, look at these guys. Oh (bleep) How's it going?
Hey. My god, you wouldn't be
happening to get on the 9 am train, would you? Oh no, we're just hanging out.
We're just getting coffee. Oh, sure, sure. Nice to see you guys.
Nah, it makes sense. Good to see you, man.
It's been so long. But this will be interesting. I am now tired and sweaty. (laughs) It's a perfect combination. I'm fully dronched. Brian, touch my back. Oh, you're like me, ugh. Hey Brian.
That was sabotage. I don't know why I agreed
to that. It was very wet. Bye guys!
Let's go chat. That's interesting. Well, this will be interesting. I mean, we don't know
where they're getting off. It's more valuable for us
to know where they're going, than for them to know
where we are going. Right. Let's just follow them around
so they can't strategize. Oh no, they got further ahead of us. Did you know that the
etymology of Jamaica, New York and Jamaica, the country,
two completely different roots? Is it?
Yeah. What, how? Because the Jamaica from New York,
that survived from an indigenous word. And Jamaica the country...
Oh. Yeah, just happened
to be the same word. Hi, guys. 'Kay, we're on car six. We overheard them say car six,
so one of us can just hang out. The handy thing with
Adam's talking so loud... He's very loud. You can hear him so far,
and his voice just travels. Newark is not close to Pennsylvania,
but Philadelphia is close to New Jersey. That is true. So maybe it's worth going
to Philadelphia regardless. I think Philadelphia regardless. ...throughout the train... Alright, so the deal is
that we really want to know where Ben and Adam get off.
That's gonna be crucial info. So we're gonna stop in Newark
soon, which is where they would get off for New Jersey. I'm gonna go just
hang out near them to see where they get off. Alright, I spotted Adam in this car. I'm gonna stay hidden for now. So hopefully they don't realize
that we realize where they are. Sam is spying on us. I just saw him. Alright, we're in Newark. The question is,
are they getting off here? I'm gonna look for them. Looks like they're staying on. He's just staring at us. Guys, go back to seats, please. Alright.
Okay. Okay, so Brian, wake up. Wake up. You awake? 'Kay, so juicy intel, okay? Juicy?
Juicy intel. So they... Adam was off the train. He spotted me watching him,
and then got back on the train. Next stop is Philadelphia,
so we'll see if they get off there, 'cause that'll makes sense. Where are they seated? They got out of their seats. They're in the cafe car now. Should I go bother them? You could. Hi, Brian. Hi, Brian.
Can I get a coffee here? You can. What? You can get a
Starbucks coffee here. How're you all doing? Doing well. How are you?
How are you feeling? Had a game of chicken there. We did a game of chicken. That's interesting. Alright, so looks like we're
both going to Philadelphia. We've looked at our cards. Pretty confident that we have a
plan that is gonna screw 'em over. Oh, I guess, theoretically,
they don't have to get off here. They could stay on until DC. They could. That'd be stupid of them. Would be. But they could do it. They could do it, but
it'd be stupid in my opinion. Alright. I have to imagine that
they're getting off here. I'm gonna go find Adam and Ben. We're waiting. Are they not getting off? Are they staying on the train? Are they going to DC? Let's make sure
that they don't get off. I'll look at this one. (wheezing chuckle) You should rush. You've got some
challenges to do. Well, would appear that
we have a little bit more time in Pennsylvania than
we might've thought. So they're super sketched out. So they're still on? No, they got off.
Oh, they got off? They got off,
but they were waiting to see what we would do again. Oh. Okay. Okay, I think we
should reconsider the plan. I think we should reconsider. I think we can do a
longer challenge here. I'm... surprised. So, I mean, we could do
the pawn shop one. I mean, my only hesitation really is
that I almost wanna save that card. It's a good one. But...
But we also— We could claim
both these states quickly, and I'm not that worried about
them getting either of them. No, cuz they're still going south. Yeah. Alright, so I know things
aren't looking great for us, but we've got a plan to
get back in the game. The card we're doing in DC
will earn us a power-up, which we can use to swap
two cards with Ben and Adam. Because DC is so close
to Maryland and Virginia, and is connected to both by Metro, we can theoretically use the
easy cards we steal from them to claim them super fast,
putting us at three states. If we can then race to
nearby Delaware, we'd be at four and in a
position to steal Pennsylvania. We just have to hope that
Ben and Adam take long enough claiming Pennsylvania and New Jersey
that we can beat them to Delaware. Alright, let's get these bikes. We're headed to
Cash Express Pawn Shop, and we have to take
bikes because... Philadelphia's right on the
border with New Jersey, which is convenient for this card, but also inconvenient 'cause
we can't take a rental car. So we're biking again. Bikes! Look everyone, it's
beautiful Philadelphia. Home of the... Phillies and
cheese steak and... Big Bell. And a big bell,
and the Constitution. Alright. Adam.
Alright. Pawn shop's a block away. Hello. So we have kind of a
weird thing that we're doing. We have to buy something
from one pawn shop, and then we have to sell it
at another pawn shop, and we have to get at least 50%
of whatever we bought back. What would be a thing that
we would be guaranteed to get back at least half
of what we paid for it? 'Cause every pawn shop
would do one third. 'Cause the pawn shop's
gonna have to make money. Alright, let's go. Welcome to the nation's
capital, Washington, DC. Why doesn't America
have more train stations? What the hell? This is so cool.
It is cool. I mean, I'm wondering if the
key is to get something that's really cheap so that they'll be willing to
if we need an extra dollar for... That's what I'm saying. That they'll maybe just
be willing to be nice to us. What would you let that go for? Six and 10? Yeah? I think, let's give it a shot. I think we should try that. Alright. Okay, so we got stuck in the
pawn shop for a really long time. That guy thought what we
were trying to do was crazy. Yeah, the guy at the
pawn shop was like, ""There's no way you'll get
50% back on like anything."" Our plan is we've bought
two rings. We bought the cheapest things
that they had at the pawn shop. And we're gonna go to the
other pawn shop, and we bought one
of the rings for just $6. And we're hoping that
if we just beg them, they'll give us $3 for it. Three dollars.
I'm nervous. We'll see. I'm from here, born and raised. So I insisted that we
consider this a state, 'cause it kind of should be. And the only reason it isn't is
because of politics and racism. So anyway, we're
considering DC a state, which is actually super useful
for challenges like this, where we have to do
everything in a state. We just gotta visit the one
Spirit Halloween in the state. Is that the White House? No. Yes, that's the
Capitol, Brian. Look at the Capitol.
My god. Show 'em the Capitol, we
gotta get in the train though. ""God damned Libs!"" PATCO to New Jersey. We gotta do this quick,
Brian, because... So we just need to take the Metro,
the Red Line to Friendship Heights. We'll do this quickly. And then we're going to steal
two of their cards, right? Yes. And then we can just
walk across the border. It's literally across the street
from this Spirit Halloween, and do something in Maryland. Wait, the border is across
the street from where we're going? From the Spirit Halloween. Yeah.
Really? Yeah, it's perfect. Holy crap.
Yeah. Oh man, your legs are so fast. I only got little legs. That's yours. Isn't this nice? It looks exactly like
some stations of Paris. Yeah, the DC metro
is so weirdly nice. It just catches on fire all the time. Catches on fire? Yeah, but it looks nice,
and that's what matters. How does it catch on fire?
Just like casually. ...center of the car. For those of you, including Brian,
who don't know Spirit Halloween, it's like this shop that pops
up for a month or two right before Halloween,
each year. And all across the US, and
there's like loads of them. And very conveniently, there's
one and only one in DC. There it is, Brian. The Promised Land. See, the little Spirit Halloween?
Oh wow. Isn't it weird that we
traveled four hours to get here? Hello, how are you? Hi there.
How are you? Look, Ben, it's
beautiful New Jersey. The heart of America. Where are you? Alright. Oh wow. I'm overwhelmed by
the choices, Sam. Sam, I think you should
get the bald cap. Bald cap? Actually yeah,
that would be funny. Thank you. Success. Do you think you're gonna be
able to fit it onto your head? That's a good question.
'Cause I have a giant noggin. I just have to get this on,
and then we can call them. Oh Jesus (bleep)! (shudders) (chuckles) You look like Benjamin Franklin. That's Maryland.
No, that's DC! Sam's calling. Oh, hey guys. So you have a bald cap on? A bald cap, what? I'm trying to imagine what
challenge would involve that. I shaved. I shaved. You look great.
You're looking really good. We come to you from our
newest state, the 51st state of the
United States, Washington, DC. We figured as much.
We figured as much. While we're at it, we just
need to quickly draw a card, and then we'll be taking
two of yours. So... stand by. Alright, we're standing by. Brian, you wanna take the top card? Just take the top one?
Yeah, but don't let them know. Show the camera, but not them. That's pretty good.
Let's keep that. So are we— we're
definitely swapping cards? I think we should. Yeah, I think we need to
get some rid of some cards. We've made our selection. You guys are gonna be taking
high five at the highest point. Okay. And win a top-tier
prize at a carnival game. Okay.
We get those, okay. Here are ours. We're gonna tempt
you with some options. Respect the weirdest
roadside attraction. Weirdest roadside attraction.
Sell something... from a pawn shop
to a pawn shop. File a Geodetic Mark
Recovery Form. That's a good one. Clean up a national park. That's hard.
Criticize the most beautiful place. Take a Chevy to a levee
and eat pie. Photograph your
partner from far away. I think we want geodetic marker and photograph your
partner from far away. I think so too. Lock it in?
Yeah. We're gonna take the geodetic
marker and photograph from far away. Okay.
Okay. Well, thank god they didn't
take the pawn shop one, but that still really sucks. In my mind, we need to
speedrun Maryland to Virginia, so I think we should use
those easy ones for Maryland and Virginia. Me too.
So... Let's maybe quickly look at the
locations of geodetic markers, see if there's one really nearby. By the way, geodetic markers are these
small metal discs that are hidden all over the country
to serve as reference points for surveying and map making. There's actually a pretty
interesting video about them. Well, not that interesting,
like Half as Interesting. There's one just like down
the street, apparently. Fantastic. We have to find it and
then fill out this form. And then in that case we
could do the other one. And... and... I have a feeling Ben and Adam might be regretting not
using those cards sooner. I told you in the car!
I know. About how if we don't use the
good cards that he is gonna steal them. That's exactly what he did.
Well it was also, they did exactly what you had
said they were gonna do, which is go all the way
down south. To DC. Get a power-up, swap,
'cause they had terrible cards. I just want, and it wasn't
on camera, so I'm annoyed. But I just want it to be known, I predicted this exact thing
would happen. Yeah, and it happened. And it kind of sucks,
but it's also fine. You might have noticed
that we very intentionally stood with the pawn shop over here,
so they couldn't tell we were at one. Alright, it's now time for
us to go and beg these people to give us $3 for this ring. Hi, good, how are you? So we have sort of a
strange thing to explain. We bought a little ring for $6,
and we're hoping against hope that you'll give us $3 for it. We came all the way
from Pennsylvania to sell you this ring for $3. Three dollars. Yes!
Yes! Yes. Thank you so much.
This is a miracle. Here's my driver's license. We got it, baby! We've done it. This is an official ad
for E&B Pawnbrokers. We love E&B Pawnbrokers,
for all your pawning needs. If you are in... what, western New Jersey. Alright, time to call Sam. Oh, that's a huge relief. I was so nervous. Okay, we're getting a call. Alright, let's see what
they have to say. Hey guys. Hello gentlemen. We have claimed
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Congratulations. Finally. What did they get? Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In one go? Yeah, so they probably
transported a pumpkin or something. Can we see your pumpkin? Yeah, show us your pumpkin. You just saw our cards. Show us your pumpkin
in a eucharistic way. I think that as our boss, you saying ""show us your
pumpkins"" is harassment. Yeah.
I said singular. This is going online. Your lawyer wants
to see your pumpkin. Alright. Good luck, guys. See you soon. Bye!
Bye! Alright, now we gotta
decide what we're gonna do. We have bunch of
really tough cards. But we get to pull
one new one. But we get—
Maybe that one will be good. Let's do that. Our new card is... What is it? Oh, Ben! Is it a tough one? Touch both oceans
on the same day. Touch both oceans
on the same day. It's not great. Look, Maryland. It looks like it
might be in this... on that side of the fence. I don't really have a good
sense of how accurate this is. Yeah. I don't think that's it. They're usually smaller,
but let's check it out. Yeah, that's not it. Did you get the coordinates? I can't get them to load in Google. So I think what we should do,
you see there's that one... and then there's
1, 2, 3, 4 more right there. So how about we go over there? Howdy. Now you might be
wondering, Ben and Adam, how are you able to
take an Uber across this state border from
New Jersey to Pennsylvania? Well, in the rules, if you
have claimed a state, then you can transit
into it however you want. So you own a state,
and we own Pennsylvania. We can enter it however we'd like. And the way we would like
is anywhere. Alright, let's start looking. Could be anywhere
under these leaves. Anything? Could it be on the
other side of the road? Brian? I don't think we should
waste time with that one. I think let's go to these ones,
'cause on the map, it looks like they're
probably newer ones. So we are in the
Philadelphia train station. We are headed to Delaware. Right... That cutie right there. Right there, baby. It's very close.
It's a very quick train. Yeah, so the reason that we're
going for Delaware is that if we claim Delaware,
it's protected, because we own every state
that borders it but Maryland. So they wouldn't be able to
get two states bordering it. Plus, they're almost certainly
going for Maryland right now, I have to assume. And if they do that,
and with Delaware, we would have two states bordering
Maryland and we could claim it. Also... we're able to get a power-up
in Delaware pretty easily by going to the highest point
and high fiving there. 'Cause Delaware is very small, and the highest point is
quite near Wilmington. There's a 20 minute train
from here to Wilmington. Yeah, and that's a card
we want to get out of our hand. Yeah.
Before we head west. We look like such
(bleep)ing weirdos. This is the exact
marked spot, but... This challenge was not as
easy as I thought it was gonna be. Yep. That could have been a mistake. What is this?
Can you imagine if that's it? Oh no, this is like
some cart thing. There's another one, right? Yeah, should we just
go to that one? Oh my gosh. One real meal a day, baby. Okay so, good news, bad news. So it turns out that there
are descriptions of what these look like on these. But this one, it turns out,
was installed in 1969. And there's a mark from
something called the US Power Squadron,
which sounds awesome. That they could not
find the mark in 2002. So they couldn't find the mark. And the Power Squadron,
I put, I trust the Power Squadron. I do too.
So... Ugh, all of these have notes saying
that they couldn't find them. The Power Squadron must
have found some, right? (bleep) Power Squadron. The Power Squadron did find this one. Oh, that's guaranteed. Okay, check this out. There's a photo for this one,
and the Power Squadron found it. It's in Bethesda. I think we
could take the Metro there. Let's go!
More running. Oh, we got one of
the new Metro lines. How great it is to get
water in there on the way back. You need to bring more water. You need water. I was already
carrying too much weight. It's why I'm so out of breath. I wondering if there's
something that you could have not
brought, Brian, that you— This is foreshadowing
right here, right Brian? I couldn't leave it behind. I spent $400 on it. I did not agree for
you to buy that $400— You told me to expense anything
that I needed for Jet Lag. You didn't need that, Brian.
I expensed a (bleep) telescope. You didn't need that. There it is. We (bleep) found one. Nice job, Brian. Okay, now we gotta
fill out the form. Okay, what's my agency code? I'm gonna put miscellaneous
commercial or private firms. We did it. Submission. My engineering
education did me good. Submission. Should we call the boys? We should call the boys.
Let's call the boys. Okay. Ugh. Just got a video from
Sam and Brian. Not looking forward to watching it. Hey, Ben and Adam. We're coming from the
great state of... M-M-M-Maryland. Maryland, okay. We have Maryland. We're hanging with the post office. Somehow that's the post office.
Can't explain how. That's where we expected them to go. Now, I think that there's
no doubt that it is going to be a scramble for Delaware. Fortunately, we're hopping
on a train to Delaware in, you know, 15 minutes. And then it's a quick train
and we're right there. So hopefully we can
beat 'em there. Let's go to Virginia.
Okay. Right, Virginia? Are we going to Virginia?
Is that what's happening? I mean, I think we
wanna go to Virginia. Brian, we need to pull
our next card. You gotta make it good.
I mean, we can't shuffle these. So you're only allowed
to pull the top one. What do we got? Spend $100 at Buc-ee's. So we gotta go to Texas or south. If you don't know,
Buc-ee's is a chain found only in the American South
of extra big, extra fun gas stations ruled by an adorable, lovable mascot
named Bucky the Beaver. I hate Buc-ee's so much, Sam. It's like, what if we
made a gas station... harder to get in and out of? Who wants to spend time
in a (bleep) gas station? Alright, let's go. Which way? So, unbelievably lucky news.
I did some research on the train, and there's a free
observation deck here. So... you can go up that. I'll go run a half mile away,
and this should be super easy. This is exactly where
we're gonna go regardless, 'cause it's the closest point in Virginia,
and there's just a free observation deck. Amazing. And it'll be tied again. Oh, it's somewhere here. Just look for the View of DC. Apparently you need your ID to get in. I'll start running
towards that spot, okay? View of— the View? Yeah, it's this building.
It's this building? So just look for an entrance
that says The View of DC. It's on Google. If you miss it, I'm gonna
start running this way. We are coming from New York. We made some stops. Here, you wanna be on camera? Yeah! Hey, I'm so excited. This is exciting. We're going to the highest point.
The highest point in nowhere. It's not very high.
No. So what we have to do,
though, is we have to... take a picture of us high fiving. Yeah? In midair. Drop off, then on the left. So if you wanna help, you
could take the picture of us. Okay.
Oh, that would be helpful. Which would actually
be really helpful. Yeah. Alright, we're here. Oh, incredible. Alright. The Metro is just there, and I just got straight into
this elevator within a minute. That was too easy. I now have to try to spot Sam from half a mile away
from up here. Okay, now I have to
figure out where he is. I can see where he is. So he's at the top of
that skyscraper. So I just need to find
a clear line of sight. Alright. (giggles) This is so cool. Okay, this is the highest
benchmark monument in Delaware. I think we should stand on the
bench, 'cause that's even higher. Oh, that is true. Alright. Here we go. Alright.
It's scary. No, let's not. Oh, it's too slippery? Okay. I have to, I have a bit of a
finagling to do with this telescope. (bleep) Oh no, (bleep) I just twisted it out of spot. (bleep) I just need to be in the shot, and then I can start
running back... and we'll have Virginia. and then I can start
running back... and we'll have Virginia. Okay, wait.
Jump up and down. Here's...
Jump up and down. Okay, I can see you. I can 100% see you. You got me?
I can see you. Yeah, I got you. Do some jumping jacks,
or something. I can't. One handed jumping. I can totally see you. Okay, you got a photo? Okay. One, two, three. Alright, I think I got it. You got it, you got it?
Yeah, I did. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got it, we got it, we got it. Yes!
(laughs) Alright, let's call 'em.
We got Delaware. Alright, I just
got word from Brian. I mean, I assume you just
watched him take a photo of me, 'cause I was on the call with him. Oh wait, it's Adam. Oh no! Oh! That's not good. We, along with the help of
our Uber driver, Keaundra, have claimed the
great state of Delaware. Ah, damn. And we got a new team member. Yeah. Bye! Okay, so that is totally
expected that they got Delaware. I mean, that's exactly
what we wanted them to do. Well, not that we wanted them
to do, we expected them to do. That does mean that they're
almost certainly gonna initiate a battle challenge on
Maryland pretty soon. Alright, with Delaware claimed, that means we have
two states bordering Maryland. Pennsylvania and Delaware. Which means that we can go
attempt to steal Maryland, which is exactly what
we're gonna do. Brian, what are you doing?
We gotta (bleep) go. Chicken nuggies.
Brian, we're gonna race. We need to go— I think we
should move to Delaware. They haven't claimed Delaware.
Well, news. They've claimed Delaware. Alright, we need to strategize. Actually first we need to call 'em, and let them know that
we've claimed Virginia. Sam is unexpectedly calling us. Where from? Hey guys.
Sponsor us, McDonald's. Hey guys. Hello? Coming to you from beautiful... Virginia.
McDonald's. Virginia.
Oh! Which is now our state. You hear that, Deandra? (laughs) I believe your name
is Keaundra, right? Yes.
What was it? The name's Keaundra.
You misheard her name. Keaundra.
Our third team member. I'm sorry, Keaundra. Anyway, you hear that,
Keaundra? What'd he say? They've claimed Virginia,
Keaundra. Oh, wow.
But we don't even care. We don't care.
We don't care about that. Sure you don't, okay. Enjoy Virginia. Bye. Thank you for all your help.
Thank you so much, Keaundra. Yeah, no problem. We are back in the
Wilmington Amtrak Station. We have a train in about
15 minutes to Baltimore. What could be better? Let's absolutely do it, baby. You still have your
chicken nuggets here. Pull a card while we're at it. While we're here, it's
time to switch out our hands. What? (despondent chuckle) We are getting the worst cards. Ooh.
Ooh, this is a good one. This a really quick and easy one. Okay. Get your chicken nuggets.
These cards are screwing us. Where is there snow
at this time of year? Aspen? Colorado, upper Michigan. There's like four resorts
open in the country. Well, we're off to war. If my guess is correct,
Adam and Ben are probably about ten minutes away
from initiating battle challenge. So we think it's worth staying
here where there's shops and stuff around us
that we could use. So we want to give it
at least 10-15 minutes to see if they start a battle challenge
before going to the airport. Alright, it is 4:30. We are in the middle of
Maryland on the train. So that means it's time to battle. Hello gentlemen. We've been expecting you. Yes.
I imagine you might be. We hereby declare a battle
in the state of Maryland. So here's how battles work. Once an attacking team has
entered their opponent's territory and declared a battle, both teams have 30 minutes
until a challenge card is drawn from the Battle Deck. Both teams will then compete in
the challenge simultaneously, no matter where in the
country they are. Whichever team wins gets the state,
and its ownership is locked, meaning it cannot be
challenged again. It's currently 4:32. The battle will start at 5:02. Okay. Alright, our bellies are full and
we're in a really good position for the battle challenges, I think. We have a lot of stores around us.
Feels like my stomach's too full. If I throw up a
chicken sandwich, oh well. Okay.
Alright. We are ready for battle. Are you prepared for battle? No, I— No, we're not. Are we filming?
We're filming. Your mic.
You ready? Oh yeah.
Yeah. Are you ready?
Yes, now we're really ready. The battle is...
The battle is... Oh, we're in a
good spot for this. Oh, we're in a very
good spot for this, Ben. Let's go! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Oh boy, that is quite the battle that Sam and those other
people have got going for them. I sure wonder how it ends. It's too bad that I have to
wait a whole week to watch that. I just wish I could watch it now. Well, boy, do I have
an answer for you, that person on the
other side of the frame. It's called Nebula. Nebula is the streaming site that
myself and a bunch of other educational-ish creators
founded ourselves. And we post every single episode of
Jet Lag there one week early. That means that yes, you can
watch season four, episode two of Jet Lag right now on Nebula, and every episode after
that one week early. And at the end of this
season, just like last season, we're doing an aftershow where we
answer a bunch of your questions, talk about some of the strategy,
bring you behind the scenes a bit, and especially we show you
a lot of unreleased footage. So the best of that, we are
showing you on the aftershow that's exclusive to Nebula
at the end of the season. You know, the reason we do this
is because this show could not exist without Nebula,
truly, as you can tell. It's an expensive show to film and
then do the post-production on. And the only way that we can
pay for that is the revenue that we get from the tens of thousands of
you that have signed up already just to watch Jet Lag
one week early. In addition to Jet Lag,
there's loads of other really good stuff on Nebula. For example, we've made
a ton of stuff, our team. Here, I'll put on screen all
the different stuff that we've made that's exclusive to Nebula. And then 150 other really
high-quality creators that you probably already watch
are all doing the same thing too. You know, making exclusive stuff, posting
stuff early, ad and sponsorship free. So there's loads of really good content. For example, if you remember
the guest from season two, Joseph from RealLifeLore, he has this
great series called Modern Conflicts. It's about going nitty gritty
into how some modern wars and battles have have gone out, and that's stuff that you
can't really make on YouTube, because of their super
strict policies about talking about violence and war,
and advertiser guidelines and stuff. So this is something that
like, it's really good content and it's unique to Nebula. It could only exist because
of the Nebula platform. And then in addition to all of that,
what's really crazy about this deal is the best way to sign up for it. And there has literally never
been a better time to sign up. That's because we are running this
bundle deal with Curiosity Stream, which is a whole other streaming site. They have really good non-fiction, smart content, documentaries,
and TV shows, and stuff like that. Really good stuff to add to your
viewing repertoire if you wanna feel a little bit more enlightened
by the entertainment that you watch. So we run a bundle deal
with them, where if you go to
curiositystream.com/jetlag and sign up for any subscription
on that page, they will throw a Nebula
subscription for free, for as long as you
stay subscribed. It's a crazy good deal. Two streaming sites
for the cost of one, but it's actually less
than the cost of one, because they're running a
42% off sale on that page. That is the deepest sale
I have ever seen in the years we've
been working with them. So it comes out to literally
$11.50-ish or something. I'll put the correct number on screen. It's crazy low.
That's not per month. You probably think that's per month.
That's for the year. It's literally the cost of a burger for an entire year of
two streaming sites, including exclusive content
from Jet Lag, and every episode one week early. And you can watch the
next episode up right now, and boy is the next episode
quite something. So I definitely encourage signing up,
and it helps support this channel, helps keep the lights on
at this channel. So, click the button on screen,
or head over to curiositystream.com/jetlag
to sign up right now. And thanks in advance
for your support."

finale of ""Tag Across Europe"". Just as a refresher,
because this is gonna happen this episode,
one way or another, there are two ways
to win this game. The Runner can reach
their end location, or at the end of 72 hours,
the win goes to whoever's location is closest
to the final Runner, which you can see in
these win areas. Simply put, whoever's win area
the current Runner is in when the clock hits 8 pm
will be declared the winner. Right now, there are five and
a half hours left in the game. All three of us are in
Mannheim, Germany, which is in my win area. But at the end of last episode,
I got caught on my train to Stuttgart, and Adam became the
next Runner. That means we're all trapped on
this train for the next half hour, headed even further
into my win area. Once the train arrives
in Stuttgart, Adam will have ten minutes
to find a way out of Stuttgart, before Ben and I
can start chasing him. And then he has to get all the way
to his slice of the map by the end of the day,
if he wants to win. Get off the train. Get off the train.
Get off the train. Get off the train. No, shoot! Oh no. Adam's on the train. Adam is on the train. He just didn't want us
to tag you right at the very moment that
the train started moving, which is Smart.
Exactly what happened. Oh no. He tagged him at the exact
moment the train started moving. So, where'd you go? Strasbourg? Yeah, we went to Strasbourg. Adam, come on over
to the cafe car. Yeah, I'm working on it. You got here faster than
I thought you could. No, you know what? The reason we were able
to get here faster is 'cause we took a car to
Austin-berg. [sic] That explains it.
I knew there was a potential. Well, I thought actually
that there wasn't. So I didn't think about a car. I still think I'm—
I'm still feeling pretty good. I still feel that... we are not near Jersey. No, we are not
anywhere close to Jersey. Yeah. Adam is gonna have a long
run ahead, that's for sure. Yep. And Adam, you better hurry up. Alright, well, we're doing a
high-speed handoff here. And then Adam is gonna have to—
I don't really want the cards. You have to take them. The cards are yours now. I don't want them. Are they shuffled?
Did you shuffle them? You have to shuffle.
Shuffle them. I'm not taking them until
they're properly shuffled. This sucks a lot. I will turn on my tracker. Alright, ready for the
high-speed handoff? Adam, you ready? Okay. It's 2:20. In a few seconds—
It was 2:20 and six seconds, and I want that to be accounted for.
Okay. 2:20 and six seconds. 2:20 and six seconds.
2:20 and six seconds. Okay, so you can start
chasing me at 3:05. And six seconds.
And six seconds. Okay, great.
Good luck, Adam. And I'm feeling pretty good
about my chances. I'm feeling very good
about my chances. I'm feeling really good...
about my odds. We take a seat and... Let's go sit down
and begin our jail period. Okay. Now I just have to desperately
hope against hope that there's a good train
out of Stuttgart. I know that there are trains
to Paris from Stuttgart, but I don't know when they leave. Okay, let's take a look. Well, Sam, we have to figure out
where Adam might be going. I don't think he'll go very far. The train is getting in
a few minutes late, so I'm gonna have even less time. Okay, really bad news. The train got in seven minutes late. I gotta go to Karlsruhe
in six minutes. So we have to stay on this
platform for 16 minutes. Welcome to Stuttgart, by the way.
Welcome to Stuttgart. It's— Well, I would say
it's beautiful, but I can't tell. I'm sure it's beautiful.
There's a train in the way. Adam is probably running around the
station trying to catch a train. 2:59. Is it delayed? No. Wrong one. I need the other one.
It leaves in four minutes. And the problem is that
exactly right now, there's a train that leaves for Paris
four minutes after this got in. So the question is just gonna be,
can he get on that train and can he get
all the way to Paris? Because it's gonna be hard for him to
afford that three-hour high-speed train. Three hour and 12 minute high-speed train.
He would have to have a ton of budget. And the last stop before Paris
is not very far from here. It's Strasbourg, so... Where you all just came from,
so that wouldn't get him that much. Alright. So I'm on the train to Karlsruhe. This actually is the train
that goes to Paris, but if you go past Karlsruhe,
seemingly, you have to have a reservation. I wonder if I can talk to somebody. Excuse me. Hi, I have a ticket to Karlsruhe. Can I buy a reservation to stay
until Strasbourg on the train? The problem is I can do
nothing, and I'm alone. Okay. Maybe you can look on
the site of the SNCF. The SNCF site. Okay.
I'm on the Eurail side. Okay, I'll try on SNCF.
Yeah. Okay. Oh! I can do it on the
SNCF website. Okay. Okay. There we go. Has Adam left the station? He has not. Oh, yep, he's gone. Okay, so let's look at how
to get to Strasbourg. Strasbourg.
That's the way, Strasbourg. So this doesn't look ideal. Okay, Ben. Good news. There is a quicker train to Karlsruhe.
When does it leave? It leaves at 3:09, but it says
it's delayed by two minutes. And it's gonna be on
platform eight. So we're on— What are we on? We're on— Platform eight's right there.
Oh, yeah. So we just have to go
one platform over, and we'll have between
three and five minutes. That's choice!
Yay. Alright, let's book this train
to Karlsruhe. Okay. It is 3:05 and six seconds. Here we go. We're off. I don't even know if we can run. Dramatic tension, even though
we have almost five minutes. This is good content. My card isn't working.
It's been a problem. I'm trying to call someone. Hey, hey, this is an emergency. My debit card isn't working. Can I use your debit card?
Do you have a Visa or a MasterCard? I have six minutes. 2-5-8... Made it.
So we're right behind Adam. Adam is on his way to Karlsruhe. We don't know if
he's gonna get off there. Yeah. But if he does,
we'll be on his tail. Okay, and what's the security code? Okay. Please, please, please work. Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please, please. Okay. Adam is just outside
of Karlsruhe now, so. We'll probably get a scent in the
next few minutes whether or not he's continuing on to
Strasbourg or stopping there. Okay. Incredible news. I have my ticket to Strasbourg. I can stay on this train. Ooh. Oh, hi. Ticket, yes. You have him?
I have an update. It would appear in that Adam
has continued from Karlsruhe. Oh no!
Which means that he's not immediately toast. Okay. So I think we're going
to Strasbourg. There's a 4:07 train from
Karlsruhe to Appenweier. And from Appenweier,
there is a... There's a relatively quick
connection to Strasbourg that would get us in at 5:36. And what— Do we know what time
Adam's getting into Strasbourg? I am gonna arrive
in Strasbourg at 4:15. They will arrive in Strasbourg
at 5:36. So I have about
an hour, 15 minutes, a little more, to probably do
a challenge and get on a train. Which is pretty good. Okay, so we are almost
in Karlsruhe. and it turns out
we can get on a train almost immediately to Offenburg. So we need to book it
once we get here, to make sure that
we can get on that. And then once we get to Offenburg,
it's a five minute connection. So we'll need to book it now.
(announcing in German) Okay. Let's go.
So close. Okay. You didn't see a problem, correct? No. We just gotta run through and look
at the screens on the platforms. Is it up there? No, this is a [indistinct] line. No. I don't think this train exists. I went to every platform
and I don't see an ICE. No. Maybe it was canceled
or something. Okay, so I got so
stressed doing research that I didn't have time to explain
much while I was on the train. So I'm doing it in VO. I already got pretty lucky
managing to get to Strasbourg, but I'm still 173 miles away
from my win area, with less than four hours
left in the game. To make matters worse,
I only have about 70 minutes until the chasers arrive in Strasbourg,
and just 1,725 coins. So, what are my options? Well, there's a train to Nancy
at 5:19 that I could afford now, but I'd still be
a hundred miles short. And it's slow-speed,
so it gets in at 7:00, and there aren't any trains I could take
from there to my win area before the game ends at 8:00.
It doesn't work. There's a train to Meuse
at 5:31. It gets me closer,
but I'd still be 55 miles short, and again, no trains from there
get me to my win area in time. It's not an option. Getting to Paris would take
2,900 coins, more than I could probably earn. Things aren't looking good. I basically need a miracle,
but then I find one. The train to Paris has
exactly one stop at a station called
Champagne-Ardennne, which it turns out, is exactly
three miles within my win area. It's my only possible way to win. The only problem is...
I'm short by 330 coins. Alright. I'm here in Strasbourg. I'm here. My train got in late.
It's 4:20. They're gonna be here at 5:36. There is a train at 5:17 that I really need to take to
Champagne-Ardennes. It is just, just, just, just
barely in the area where I win. But I'm 330 coins short, so... Okay, I'm gonna draw a card. I just need it to be an easy card. Please, please, please,
please, please. Here we go. Top card. What is it? Get 1,000 feet from
any building. Oh no. Oh no. I don't know
if that's possible here. Oh no. I don't know
if that's possible here. Okay, I might veto this! Ah, shoot! Okay, I'm gonna take a look
at if this is possible. Ben, there's apparently
a direct bus leaving at 4:15 directly to Strasbourg from here. From here?
From here. And Adam will never
suspect that bus. Yeah, let's hop on that
4:15 bus and get directly to
where he is going. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This isn't very good. Okay, there's a bunch of fields,
but they're 25 minutes away. I don't think I could get there. There's a lake. What if I got into
the middle of the lake? Can I swim that far? No. I don't think
I could swim that fast.  Or, I also might die. (tense moan) No. Okay. I'm vetoing.
I'm vetoing. I'm vetoing. I can pull another card
at 4:55. (groan) Okay. Oh, shoot! Just gotta hope this is on time. (distant brassy music) That's delightful. Yeah. Little ambience
for the end of the series. Can we legally play this? I don't know. Unless that guy comes for us. Okay, we found the bus. So we're making a beeline
for Strasbourg. Okay, while I'm safe here
during my veto period... I'm gonna just walk to the
outside of the train station, more towards where
the town would be, in the hopes that when
I pull my next card, if it's doable, that I can
do it in not that long. This is gonna be a
really long 30 minutes. Okay, let's see.
Adam, what are you up to? He's outside the station. You just hanging out? Guess he's trying to do
a challenge right there. Trying to get back on a train,
which makes sense. Where could you be going?
What could you be doing? You haven't gone far. I'm gonna need to get really lucky. Like, really lucky. Oh... 'Get away from a building'. I just, I can't, you can't
do that in an hour. Not here. So that train, the TGV to Paris, it actually stops in
Champagne-Ardenne. So he could save on budget,
or go for less, by just taking it to there. So it could come down
to three miles. But here's the deal. If he does do that, we have a 6:17 train to
Champagne-Ardenne, so we could catch up to him. Imagine if it's a 33-minute... attempt to tag him before the end
to decide the game. Whew. That would be something. Ten more minutes of veto jail. Just hoping for the best. Absolutely panicking. Just a dead panic. Okay, so we just realized that we
can actually take a train from Kehl and get into the station like... Slightly.
a little quicker. It leaves in under ten minutes. Oh god, okay. Where is the train station?
Is this it? Yeah, I think this is it.
Okay. Alright, we're coming
for you, Adam. Okay. Here we go. Hide your phone. You must place your personal phone
down in a publicly accessible location. It does not need to be visible. Travel at least 0.25 miles
away from your phone before you turn to retrieve it. If the phone is stolen—
Okay. I think I can do that. I'm putting my phone
in these garbage cans. Okay. 0.25 miles. Alright. I need to see how
far away 0.25 miles is. Okay. Measure distance. I just need to go down
this street til I get to the... just before the
Musée d'art moderne. Phone stashed in garbage can. Let's go. You just staring
right at the camera? This isn't tense at all. I don't know how to look tense. This is the big climax
of the whole show! There's no train. I'm stressed. Okay. That sign indicates that... this is the Musée. This is it. It says, «Entrée du musée». So, yeah, head back. I'm very tired. Train, where's the train? Train's supposed to be here. Well, we're still technically
in Germany, so. Yes. I don't know. Germany trains today,
they're not cooperating. One last... F U to us from Germany. Trash can. Oh god.
Please still be there. Ha-ha! Alright. Okay, I gotta book that train. I think I can make it. Alright, this is where
I got messed up before. It's checking with the bank. Please go through. Come on. Then it goes back to here. Then it does this again. Please. It's money. Verify. Continue. Come on. Please work. Please work.
Please work. Please work. Please work. Please work. Please work. Please work. Please work. Please work. Please work. Yes! I got it! I got the ticket. Yes! There it is. Oh... Ben... it is not looking good. Oh. (sigh) That circle moved fast. Alright, well it looks like Adam
did make it outta Strasbourg. Question is, did he get out
on the TGV or on another one? Finally our train's here. If the train stops in Saverne... he's on the train to Nancy. If it doesn't... Then he's on the train to Paris. He's on the train to Paris,
and we're donezo. (heavy sigh) Okay, he's still on the move. He's just nearing the town
that would be the first stop on the train to Nancy. If he passes that town
without stopping, then... he's headed to either Paris
or Champagne-Ardenne. He's on the TGV, and... He's gonna make it? Well, either way,
I'm toast, so... Pour one out for me
back at home. Oh, no.
Yeah. Oh, oh, no, no.
Not to that. That's so sincere.
Thank you. He— No, no. Genuinely he passed it. He— He— Haha. Sam loses too.
Sam loses too. Well there's the 6:17 train that gets us to the same stop
before the rest period. We gotta give it a shot. We do gotta give it a shot.
6:17, you said? I think so. I mean, the chances are low,
but they're not nothing. We gotta give it a shot. Alright. We have made it... to Champagne-Ardenne. This spot right here is
285 miles from Zermatt. 281 miles from Jersey. We have specific locations
in each place, an observatory in Zermatt,
and a lighthouse in Jersey, that were the specific spots
that we measured from. I don't know when they
could get here. I don't think they could
get here that soon, but I don't know for sure. Adam is nearly to
Champagne-Ardenne station. If he goes through to Paris,
when you have the budget to go all the way to Paris,
we're done. We don't get to Paris
until after eight. Game over. Adam wins. GG. If he stops there,
we're gonna get there at 7:25. So we've a chance
of tagging him, and literally, here's the thing. Just one mile east of the station, one mile bit east of the station,
it goes to me. But it's Ben's turn.
So Ben gets to decide who wins. Ben, I might maybe drop some
euros on the way up the stairs. Oh, I will be accepting bribes
from either party. Really?
Oh, yes. Oh yes. Yeah, okay.
It just moved. I think he's definitely going
off the Bezannes bridge. We're still in business. Oh, we're coming for you Adam. We have 35 minutes
on the ground to tag him in Champagne. We've gotta do it. Yep, we've gotta do it. See you there. Okay, so there aren't any
useful trains for like an hour, and I'm too worried
they'd be able to get here. So the plan is I'm just
gonna walk due west. and think if I get pretty far,
then even if I do get caught, then the Runner would
also have to walk, 'cause they wouldn't be
able to take a car. And it's not possible that
they would be able to get into a territory where I don't win. Okay, good news. I thought that
this said no trespassing. But, «Défense de déposer des ordures
et encombrants sous peine d'amende» just means, ""Prohibition to deposit rubbish
and bulky items under penalty of fine."" I will not deposit any
rubbish or bulky items! (imitates guitar strumming) ♪ (hums ""Eye of the Tiger"" riff) I'm gonna win. (scats) Right. We're basically here. It's not figuring—
Just gotta get to Adam. It looks like he's just walking
through the countryside. Away, like, west. Which, I mean,
that's what I would do. I mean, yeah.
Christ. What's gonna be the fastest
way to get us a taxi? He's somewhere out there. Oh my god. I mean, is that not the
content that you crave? That is the French countryside,
for sure. It really would've been smart
to refill my water bottle before I started doing this! Every car I see, I wonder if it's
a taxi that Sam and Ben are in. I don't think they could have
gotten here by now, though. I also think that they would
have a lot of trouble communicating to a taxi where to go
to come and get me. Surely Ben and Sam
have figured out what I'm doing at this point, right? 'Cause they can see me on the tracker
so they can see that I'm just... in the middle of a field,
nowhere. I wonder what they're saying. That's Adam. I still think we're gonna get him. It's not gonna be very easy
to sneak up over there though. Nope. ♪ This ship we sail is a kayak ♪ ♪ It's a kayak
that we rented here ♪ ♪ We love to sail our lovely— ♪ Whatever really stupid bits
made it into the edit... There's like fifteen... even worse bits that you
aren't even gonna get to see. Is that them? Oh man.
I think that might be them. Why else would a taxi stop
in the middle of that road? (speaking French) Merci. Are you just going?
Are you just going for him? I'm hiding. 'Cause he's gonna run away. Okay. I'm jogging. Yeah, that's definitely them.
They're coming after me. Oh (bleep)! Oh (bleep), they're
back in the taxi! (bleep) Tag! Ohh. Okay. Let's go to Ben. That taxi driver came in clutch. He didn't understand
what I was trying to explain. I can't believe you
got him to come here. Oh yeah, he was a
little confused. Alright, that's yours. Well, gentlemen, I don't even have time to get to
the point where Sam would win. Don't say that I do,
because I don't. I believe in you. I don't.
I believe in you! But I do have time to do
one last challenge with both of you. Wow.
Let's do it. Get on a train immediately. Go. You have ten minutes.
You have ten minutes. Good luck. That taxi could come back. You can't take a taxi. I'm off, gentlemen. Bye, Ben!
Goodbye! I don't think I can make it! I believe in you! Make sure you're filming yourself. I see that why they named it
after such a pretty beverage. Rhiems. Champagne. We could... We could go get our
dog trained while we're at it. Well, since this jail period
will never end, we're allowed to wander.
Wanna just go walk with Ben? That makes a point.
We can wander as much as we want. That's a point, yeah.
Let's go up to Ben. 'Cause we are allowed to
move during jail periods, as long as we resume
at the same spot. Yeah, but we won't ever resume. So I say we go catch up to Ben. We finish this thing out together! He's all alone out there! Well, folks... that's wrap on season three. Thank you for watching. All the support has been
really overwhelming. Hey, buddy! We're coming to hang out! Keep going, Ben,
and you can make the train! I believe in you! This isn't a tag, it's a hug. Ohh, hug!
Look at that. Alright. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. It's 8 pm. Congratulations, Adam.
Thank you, buddy. You get to brag about that
for one week, and then you don't get to
talk about it again. Sam, you've been bested
once again. Wait, I guess I have
something for you. Yeah! Alright. It's the season three trophy. You ready for it, Adam? Oh my gosh.
What is it? Oh my god. This is a heavy one. Ohhh!
Ohhh! Oh my god! It's so incredible! Oh! They've increased the
quality of that by so much. We have the money to afford such
a nice digital trophy this time. Oh my gosh. I love it. If you're wondering why I lost, it's 'cause I had to lug that
whole thing around Europe. Yeah.    So true.
Really weigh me down. Yeah. Oh man. Alright. Let's find a hotel. I'm jet lagged. Ohh, he said the thing!
Gottem! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus He said the thing! That's it, we're done!
Season three's over! ...Sort of. I'll explain. So of course, we really need to
thank all of you for your support. The support this season
has been crazy. You all have been so nice in your feedback.
The channel's grown like crazy. And we need to especially thank
the support of our Nebula subscribers. Because our Nebula subscribers,
quite literally, are funding the show. It could not work financially
without them. In appreciation for that,
we made a 45 minute long, Nebula-exclusive aftershow. We dive deeper into
some of the strategy, we answer some questions, we show some deleted scenes
and extra footage. It's pretty great.
I think y'all will enjoy it. It's basically giving you all
what you have already asked for. And it's only on Nebula.
Nebula-exclusive. It'll albees—
always be Neblus-s— (sputtering) Nebula-exclusive, to thank
the Nebula subscribers. But the good news is if you're not
already a Nebula subscriber, it's actually super-cheap
and easy to sign up. Let me explain. So basically,
Nebula, we co-founded it. I co-founded it with
a bunch of other creators. And it was made to be
the best home to our content. So we designed it from the ground floor
to just support good videos. And that means, for example,
it's not ad-supported. It's supported through a paywall. So we're not incentivized to just
do the thing that gets the most views. We're incentivized
to make the best videos. Make the best videos that get people
to sign up and get people to stay. It also doesn't have an algorithm,
so we're not trying to appeal to an algorithm with
clickbaity titles or anything. So that means we're able to make
exclusive videos, higher-budget videos, that just couldn't work
financially on YouTube. And then we actually partnered
with Curiosity Stream, which is a whole other
streaming site which has all sorts of nonfiction
shows and documentaries, a lot of which are made by
pretty big names. Massive catalog, lots of great stuff. And if you go sign up at our link,
curiositystream.com/jetlag, any of those subscriptions there
include a Nebula subscription, for as long as you stay subscribed,
and here's the thing. When you go to our link,
they're running a sale only at our link. less than fifteen dollars a year to sign up for Curiosity Stream,
and that includes Nebula. So that would be a great deal
for one streaming site, but it's for two streaming sites,
and you get to watch this Nebula-exclusive aftershow right now, and for next season,
and every Jet Lag beyond, you get every episode early.
It's such a good deal. So it's worth going to that link,
and you'll be supporting the show. And you'll lock in that
amazing pricing. Click the button on screen,
or head over to: Watch the aftershow.
Watch season four early. Which by the way, my flight for that
leaves in exactly twelve hours. So I gotta go pack.
Bye!"

I'm feeling really confident about getting to my win location. So confident that at the end of
the last episode, I said: I think we're going to
Zermatt tomorrow. And I think we're winning
this thing, honestly. The bad news is... Well, you'll see. Okay, I just identified a problem. They could make this 6:13. Their pause period
ends at 6:10. And that could connect to the train
that I'm gonna take tomorrow morning. So I need to decide what
I'm gonna do about that. Okay, it's 8 pm.
The rest period is starting. 8 pm. The rest period just started! We will see you back
at this exact spot, at 6 am. So sleepy. The game has restarted. Okay.
Yaay. Through the power of
YouTube magic, it is 6 am. Good morning.
We are back at it. And it is officially... 6 am. Let's go to it. Alright, so. We still have to stay here
for ten minutes. It appears that Sam is actually gonna
take the train directly behind us. It leaves at 6:03, and it
gets him to what train station? Bruxelles-Midi. Yeah, so the biggest train station—
Oh, there he is. There he is. I have an important
message for you. Okay. Let me make sure I'm recording. Okay, so at 6:10, that's when you
get released, right? Yes.
Wrong. 'Cause I'm buying a
2,000-coin powerup. You're staying here for
another 10 minutes. Nooo! God dammit!
Bye~! Now I'm getting on this train. We kinda thought
he might do that, but that... It's a worthwhile expenditure.
It's worthwhile expenditure for him. I'm sure that means that he can
probably get on a train to Brussels. Okay. It's just gonna be a question... of where the hell he
goes from here. Yeah. Just getting into
Brussels-North station, in about 15 minutes before
my train to go Cologne, which is perfect. Not too tight of a connection,
but tight enough. Ben, Adam, I checked,
definitely can't make it. So, train at 6:25 to Frankfurt. That would make
a lot of sense for him. Shoot, we can't get on a
train there till 7. There's not— (sigh) The next one would get in
at 11:30 to Frankfurt. So we would be behind him
by two hours. He wouldn't even be winning
at Frankfurt. It's 280— You would
still be winning. So he won't do—
He won't stay there. So he has—
He'd have to keep going. Just as a reminder, I don't need to
get all the way to my location to win. I just need to be in this part of the map
when the clock strikes 8. But if I, or whoever the Runner is
at the end of the game, is in one of the other win locations
when the time runs out, then Ben or Adam will win instead. He has to get out of Frankfurt
if he wants to win. And that means he has to head
straight towards Strasbourg. How soon could we get
to Strasbourg? There is a 7:17 train to Strasbourg. Straight to Strasbourg. Let's go to Bruxelles-Midi... with the intention of going
to Strasbourg. Yeah.
I think that is the best option. It's the only thing that
puts us ahead of Sam. Okay. Great news.
I see this train. It's here. It's on time.
That's fantastic. We're gonna move outta here.
We're going to Cologne. And Ben and Adam are not,
at least for two hours. The train that we wanna
take to Strasbourg, it says it's too soon
before it leaves... To book a seat. Yeah, so we need to book... At the station.
At the station. Not ideal.
Not ideal. Is he leaving? Yep, yep, yep. He's in the train.
Yeah, he is. Literally—
We're literally— I think he's literally on that train.
He's on this train. He literally is on this train. Man... (whispering) That close! So main thing now as I'm
going to get to Cologne, I need to complete the
one-mile challenge quickly. I can't afford to get
to Zermatt, so I think I need to
take a risk... buy another double powerup
and pull another card. Go exactly one mile. Close your eyes, spin in a circle,
and point in a random direction. You must go as close as possible
on publicly-accessible land. This is good. This is good. And then just make sure
I'm out of Cologne... within two hours,
within when they could get there. Where the hell do we go?
Tickets... It's a... It's a TGV. It says tickets right there. Don't run, or people think
there's a terrorist attack. Just fast-walk.
Fast-walk. ♪ Everything is okay ♪ Oh, is it here? We're trying to get tickets on
the 7:11 TGV to Strasbourg. (indistinct) Alright.
So we've just managed to get our tickets to Strasbourg.
That is, yeah. Let's make sure that we don't
show our personal information. Well, we'll blur it.
We got our tickets to Strasbourg. I'm feeling amazing that
we managed to pull that off. I did not think we were gonna
be able to get tickets. So we're gonna be
right ahead of Sam. Yeah, so we are gonna be
way ahead of him. This is really good. 717... track five. I've been doing research,
and the news is less than ideal. So basically here's the situation. So, turns out
that Ben and Adam actually still have
a pretty good route. So they could have made this train from Brussels Airport
to Brussels-South station, and then made this TGV
to Strasbourg. It goes nonstop
all the way to Strasbourg, which puts them basically
right within spitting distance of where I want to be. 'Cause I need to go
either through Basel or Zürich. Yeah. Our train to Strasbourg
is leaving. Three and a half hours. ♪ That means it's bedtime ♪ Oh, I'm excited to take a nap. 'Cause there's basically
nothing we can do. Yeah. Even if it turns out
Sam is doing something different
than what we thought... Strasbourg would still be
the place to go. Because, what are we gonna do?
Get off in Paris? That's just gonna be worse.
Yeah. Alright. We're arriving in Cologne.
I got two hours to get outta here. Alright, I found a spot
to hide while I do the incredibly awkward thing of
spinning around with my eyes closed. Well, here we go. Oof. Okay. This way. Let me figure out
which way that way is. So it looks like Sam has
left the station in Cologne. Yep. So it seems like
he's doing a challenge. I'm assuming he's still
gonna go to Frankfurt, but... Yeah, I was looking. It seems like he can still
really only go in that direction, and it's where we're headed. Yep. So... See you soon, Sam. Okay, seemingly,
I am headed to here, Fontanestraße[phone tah neh straw bay]. Let me get directions to there. On the move. On the— Wait.
I'm supposed to go this way. Wait, am I? Okay, the good news is this seems
to be on a metro line or something. Or some sort of transit line,
so it's probably gonna be pretty efficient to get back here
if we need to in a rush. Alright, we're getting into the
residential area where that spot is. You just have one left turn and right there. That was easy. Well, if you ever wanted
to know what was exactly one mile north of
Köln Hauptbahnhof, It's this delightful little
residential street. Alright, I'm going to figure out
what to do next now. If the number of people getting
on the train is any indication, I think we just... Just barely.
barely made it onto this thing. All of these people.
It's like completely full now. We're in Lille
for the third time. Man, who knew we were
gonna go to Lille so much? I love Lille city. It's a great spot. Alright, I have 40 minutes
to the next train to Frankfurt, and there's another one
47 minutes after that, so I have some time to plan. I'm thinking the
right move now is to... do another double-up powerup
and pull another card. I have a pretty... I'm pretty certain I'm safe
for at least another hour, so I might as well just do
the double-up powerup. Alright, I'm gonna lock it in. I'm gonna buy the double-up
powerup again for a third time. On that note,
I'm gonna pull a card. Eat the national dessert. Germany: Berliner. Okay, I have enough time,
but not copious time, before those two back-to-back
trains to Frankfurt, and I should have a few minutes
to look for a Berliner. And if not, I'll look in Frankfurt. I've gotta hurry. It doesn't show a platform number. ""Zug fällt aus.""
What does that mean? No-o-o-o... Sam probably wants to get out
of Cologne within two hours, 'cause we could have gotten there
two hours after him. Yeah, the train to
Cologne from Brussels, the one that we could've made,
left exactly two hours later. So, he's gonna know that, and he's not gonna stay there
any longer than that. I wouldn't imagine
that he would.  That is tremendously bad, because
I already bought that train, and once we buy a train,
our coins are gone. I just lost almost
1,600 coins on that. Looks like there's a slightly
faster itinerary to Frankfurt. If I... If I go back to the main
Hauptbahnhof, there's a train from
here to there in seven minutes. So I think that's the best
thing to do right now. I messed up. I'm frazzled. I do not have the money to
take the train to Frankfurt now. That means I need to,
somewhere in... I'm not gonna make
that one I was aiming for, but somewhere in
Köln Hauptbahnhof, I need to find a Berliner. That will earn me—
It will earn me 1,800 points. It'll earn me enough to get to
Frankfurt, but not much further. And oh man, this sucks. Surely Dunkin' has one, right? None of them are called Berliners.
They're just doughnuts. All these places, they're just
calling them doughnuts. Okay, so he was at
a train station, and then he took a train
to another train station. We assumed he was leaving the city. But now he's taken a train back
to the first train station. Be more predictable, Sam. Okay, bingo. This place has reviews saying,
""Don't miss their famous Berliner."" And it's like right here. Ye-e-e-e-es! Hi. Can I have a Berliner? Oh, very nice. Oh yeah. They could be getting
here in ten minutes. I need to figure out a train
once I can finish this donut. Once I finish this donut,
I think I'll get... 1,800, right? Yeah. There's a train to Frankfurt
at 10:18. I think we gotta do that. Let's go for it. We're gonna be in Strasbourg
in about an hour and a half. Do we wanna stay there, or do we wanna try to
intercept him in Frankfurt? We'll just have to see where he is.
Let's see where he is. I mean, our move's feeling
better and better to me. Fingers crossed. It's canceled! This one's canceled too. Luckily I didn't book this time. Okay, looks like there's
another train to Frankfurt, at least to Frankfurt Airport... in about 30 minutes. Hopefully it's not canceled. I'm gonna aim for that and
then draw another card. See if I can complete
another challenge. I don't think I'm gonna
double up this time. I... Yeah, 'cause I really wanna
get on this train and get out of... here. Alright, here's the deck. Alert the Chasers as soon
as you pull this card. Choose a building within
two miles where you are now. Send the Chasers its address,
turn off your tracker, and then find... Awesome. I don't think they're
anywhere near here. We're in Champagne. [sham pahn ya] Did you know that it doesn't count
as the region of Champagne, unless you're in
Champagne, France? Good bit, Adam.
(both giggling) As long as we have
a really big building. Honestly, it might be this one. So it looked like on the satellite view,
there's a rooftop parking garage. I feel like that's a relatively
unintuitive place, so I'm gonna try that. Alright. Here is the rooftop. Oh, wow. There's not a single car here. Okay. I'm gonna hang out here
for an hour. It's got some nice shade. It's got some shelter. I don't think they're here
anyways, and I don't think that this would be
the first place they would look. I bet they would
search the store first. So assuming Ben and Adam
are doing what I think they are, which sure seems like they are. They should be getting into Strasbourg
exactly in two minutes. So I'm gonna look, if they're in Strasbourg,
what would they probably do next? I think it's very possible
that Ben and Adam predict that I'm gonna go to Frankfurt next. Which to be fair,
I likely am, although maybe not,
in this case. But given that, it seems like the earliest
they could get to Frankfurt is 3:08 pm from Strasbourg,
so I'm gonna keep that in mind. We are here in Offenburg. We took a taxi a half hour
from Strasbourg, across an international border, because it turns out we can
get to Frankfurt a whole lot faster if we drive here and then take
a train from Offenburg. We'll be there around two,
I think, right? (slow-mo voice)
Earliest they could get to Frankfurt is 3:08 PM. But yeah, we're
about to board a train to... What's the place called?
It has a fun name. Baden-Baden.
Baden-Baden. And then we're gonna go
Baden-Baden to Frankfurt. Okay, so the main problem
now is that basically all the trains between
where I am and Switzerland go on this main stretch
between Frankfurt and Basel. And they're, I think,
in Strasbourg right now. So they can go up and down
this line pretty easily. So I need to find a way to either
get vaguely towards where I'm going, not on this line,
or a way to jump over them. The reason we're going to Frankfurt
is because there are a number of things that Sam
could do after he leaves Cologne. He could go on a really long
high-speed train down to Basel, but we could intercept him in Frankfurt,
just like we could intercept him here. He might be just going
to Frankfurt to do challenges, in which case obviously,
we could get him in Frankfurt, or he could be going east... to... I don't know. Nuremberg or something.
Anywhere in Germany. And in that case, he would
either go through Frankfurt, and we could try to get him,
or if he goes there, being in Frankfurt's gonna be
a lot better than being here. So this is our most
flexible option probably. Yeah. It's really annoying
that we came all the way here, 'cause we could have been
in Frankfurt like... now. Actually a little before now. But we thought Sam
was gonna be smarter... We overestimated him.
than he is being. We won't make that mistake again.
No. Okay, so to be honest,
I don't think that this game is gonna end with me getting to
Gornergrat Observatory in Zermatt. There's just not enough
time left today. And I don't have enough
budget right now. I'd need to do more challenges. What I need to be focused on
is the second win condition. Okay, I think I have a plan. There's a 12:18 train
to Frankfurt. Then there's a relatively
quick transfer to Stuttgart. The advantage of Stuttgart is
it gets me out of the corridor that they're gonna be going up. If my timing is right
and my guess is right that they're gonna head north
to Frankfurt to try to cut me off, then I should be able
to get to Stuttgart, and especially get to the
intermediate station, Mannheim, before they can,
and so I'll jump them. And hopefully they'll be
still headed north. From Stuttgart, there are
trains south to Zürich. They're long, but
they're slow-speed trains, so they cost less. Alright, it is 11:50, and as you can see,
no Ben or Adam. So... let's go to... first Frankfurt, and then
I think next Stuttgart. The train's here. Yaay. Off to Baden-Baden. Please, please,
let's go to Baden-Baden. Okay, turns out there's a delayed
direct train to Stuttgart. Google says the train, the station
is twelve minutes away. I think I can make it in six. I think I can do it. Wait, this is just Baden. Look. We need to get to Baden-Baden.
This is... We need one more Baden. Our train leaves in seven minutes,
and we're not there yet. Okay. Five minutes.
Station's in sight. I think our train literally
leaves in one minute. It's on platform four. Wait, wait. Platform six, I think. Wait, god dammit.
Where's our train? That's platform four. That's our train leaving. Made it. We can still get to Karlsruhe. Ah, this is not... ...great.
This is not what we wanted. That was the wrong one. I don't know how I got
platform six. That was to Munich. I want platform four. Okay. It was the platform six one. I don't know. I was confused. He said Munich. I just missed it. (train horn) It's literally that one. Okay, that's not a massive deal. It just loses me 20 minutes. That's fine. Okay, well our train into Baden-Baden
got in a couple minutes late. Just long enough for us to
miss the train to Frankfurt. So we're staying on this train. It's gonna go all the way
to Karlsruhe. Or maybe we just hope
he comes down to Karlsruhe. Most of the trains down
would stop there. It looks like he just left
for Frankfurt, so... I don't know. I don't
totally know what to do. Okay, so we missed
our train to Frankfurt, but we managed to get one
to Mannheim, which we're about to
get on now. Sam appears to be
on his way to Frankfurt. If he goes south at all, he will have to go through
Mannheim, almost certain. And we will know
what train he's on. We can just get
on that train and then Exactly. Exactly.
he's trapped on that train with us. Alright, welcome to
Frankfurt Airport station. So hopefully right around now,
Ben and Adam are desperately panicking over
where I could possibly go next. And hopefully they're
not concluding Stuttgart, 'Cause honestly, that doesn't really
make sense to get to Zermatt. But right now I'm not really
focusing on getting Zermatt. I'm just focusing on
getting safely south. Okay. Okay. Alright.
We are here in Mannheim. We're almost certain that Sam
is gonna have to come to Mannheim. He's in Frankfurt now. Frankfurt is still in the
region where Ben would win. Sam has to go south. I guess he could technically
go really far east, but like... it's so easy
for him to get here. If he wants to go to Zermatt,
he has to come here. So we're just gonna wait, figure out what train he's on,
if it starts to come here. And then once it stops here,
we're just gonna get on it. And then we'll tag him. And if it doesn't come here... There's no way!
It has to come here. Ehh, we'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out. So this only stops in
Mannheim. That's the only risk. But it seems that the earliest
they could get there from when they would've gotten
from Strasbourg would've been 2:24. And this will go through at 2:04.
So it should just miss them. Assuming that works. While we wait for Sam to
fall into our little trap, we've gotten some food. Ben and I both got waters. Mine is the daddy water. I got a little baby water.
And Ben's is the baby water. I'm already carrying
way too much weight. I can't carry this thing. Okay, I think that he got on a train
to Mannheim just recently. We just have to
figure out which one— Okay, I think we found
what he was on. We think that he got on
a 1:33 train to Stuttgart [stew gurt] that
goes through Mannheim. We just need
to figure out where— We can look at the arrivals. Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.
We gotta hurry. We gotta hurry. Yeah, he gets in at 2:05. We just have to figure out
what platform he is. Platform five. Okay, it's gonna be here
in about 15 minutes. I got way too close
to your face on this one. Okay, so I've just realized... that if I'm not able to tag Sam and then get off the train
before it leaves, I'm gonna be on the train with them
during almost their entire jail period. Now you might say, ""Why don't you get
on the train and wait to tag him?"" But I want Adam
to be subjected to that train. That'll be— 'Cause then we tag him
right away and then it's my turn, and we're still in my zone,
and I win. We need to make sure
he doesn't see us, 'cause if he sees us get on,
he'll get off. Yeah.
And then we'll leave on the train. I don't think he's gonna
suspect us here. No, I don't think so either.
But we need to hide. Yeah. We're gonna split up to
different sides of the platform, so we can close in
on him like that. Okay. I think this is the train. It's a long train. I got a lot of cars to look through. Okay. Gonna move to the front. Okay. I'm looking. We're sure he didn't get off? I didn't see him. I didn't see him get off. Okay. He's at the front—
He's at the back of the train. I can tell by where he is
at the platform. Okay. Unless he got off. But it doesn't look like
he's moving at all. Sorry. I still don't see him. Oh, sir. Are you having tags?
You're it. I got him. Oh, oh, I'm meant to
get off the train. Get off the train. Get off the train.
Get off the train. Get off the train. No, shoot! Oh, no... Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Trapped on a train, and with
just five hours left in the game, does Adam have any shot
of getting out of my zone? Or is the Runner gonna go to Ben, and will he beeline north to Borkum
to get out a last shot at victory? Or is the game mine,
are we too deep in my zone with too little time left
for them to get out? All of these questions will be
answered one week from today, on the Jet Lag season finale. Or right now, if you're a
Nebula subscriber. If you're not a Nebula subscriber,
the good news is that getting access to Nebula
is actually really easy. It's kind of this weird deal,
where it's cheaper than signing up for Nebula directly,
to sign up for Curiosity Stream. Because when you go to our link,
curiositystream.com/jetlag, they do it as a bundle where you get
a Nebula subscription for free, forever, as long as you stay subscribed,
when you sign up there. So it's two streaming sites
for the price of one, and actually kind of
less than one, because also at that link,
they have it on sale. So you can get an entire year of
Curiosity Stream and Nebula for just $14.79 a year. Not monthly,
that's for the entire year. That's less than you probably
pay for a decent lunch. So if you wanna watch the
Jet Lag season finale right now, plus all the other
exclusive stuff made by us and loads of other independent
creators on Nebula, plus watch the aftershow —
I don't know if I mentioned that, the aftershow that
we'll release next week, where we give you all sorts of
behind-the-scenes footage, and extra footage
and deleted footage, and we answer all sorts
of strategy questions, and that's all exclusive
to Nebula forever — all of that for just $14.79. And you'll be helping support this channel,

episode five of ""Tag Across Europe"". Even if you've seen the
previous four episodes, you might wanna stay for this recap,
because things are getting sticky. Right now, Adam and I,
the Chasers, are pursuing Ben on his way
to Borkum, Germany. We just got off the train to
Saint-Quentin, where Ben currently is, one stop early
in a town called Tergnier, because we thought he was
going to leave Saint-Quentin, and go to Amiens,
where we could catch him. Unfortunately for us, Ben didn't
get on the train to Amiens. He got on the train we were
just on, heading to Maubeuge, a small town with
very few connections, where we can't possibly catch him. That means Adam and I have to
figure out where he's going next, and we think the answer
is Brussels. We just have to hope that's
where he ends up, and that we can get there
before he manages to leave. That is so embarrassing. Oh my God, he got on
the train that we got off. Let's figure out our
fastest route to Brussels. We want to go to Brussels, right?
He's going to Brussels. Okay, here we go. I just need to figure out
where I go after this. And I... honestly have no idea. We have to go back to Paris? I think it thinks it's
the fastest route, yeah. Oh my god! Are we sure he's going north? (stammering) Yeah, he's well north of the station. Oh, Jesus! I think after I get to Maubeuge, my best bet is to go to Lille. And I know, I'm sorry, okay? I know we already went to Lille,
and this is a travel show, but here's the bright side, okay? I got a lot of coins burning
a hole in my pocket, and Lille is... ...a big hub, very busy hub. So I think I'll be able to just hop
on a train right when I get there. And we won't have to waste
too much time there, which is also good, because that's... It's gonna be an easy place
to intercept me, unless they're already
waiting for me there. Cut to them
waiting for me there... ...right now. What is the bad news? The train we need
to Brussels is sold out. No... Yes. No, that can't be right. We're sure there's not
a bus we could get on? Nope. Could we fly there? Not from here. Like, if we went back to Paris,
could we fly to Brussels? Weirdly, there are flights
between Paris and Brussels. But, not— No more today.
They all leave in the morning. This is not good. This is really bad. Alright, welcome to Maubeuge. I have about an hour, a little over an hour actually,
before the train to Lille. So while I'm here, I might as well
try to do a challenge. And if I have to veto it,
it's not a big deal. Let's go ahead and
pull our next card, and find out what it is
that we're gonna be doing. Okay, go exactly one mile. I am standing still. I'm gonna spin around and
point in a direction at random, and then we are going to...
look at a map and figure out
where that location is. So long story short,
things are quite bad. We're in a bit of pickle. Right now, we think that
we want to get to Brussels, because it seems like Ben
is headed to Brussels. Yeah. So I think that
what we do is we go here to Amiens, we go Amiens to Lille,
and then we go Lille to Brussels, and we get there just before 7:00. It's not for an hour.
So we've unexpectedly earned ourselves some time in...
We're just gonna hang out. What's this place called?
Tournai? Yeah, oh no... Tergnier[tursen-yer]. Tergnier. Oh, I sure feel stupid
right now. Okay. Okay. I'm dizzy. Okay. So this is the direction
that I'm pointing. It seems like it's
right next to this school. It would take much more than
a half hour to walk there, so I couldn't walk there
and back. There is a bus that would kind of
take me kind of close to there, but it would take like 20 minutes and
that bus only arrives in 20 minutes. So I'm just gonna go ahead,
I'm gonna veto this. We're just gonna chill. We don't even need the money. We can get out of Lille without
the money, so who cares? I'm gonna try and find
a place to hide. I see some woods over there, and I think I honestly
might just... ...crouch in the woods
for a little bit... ...until it's time for my train. Tergnier, more like... ...tree ne-ar. Tergnier, more like tree right there. Wait, you just made
that joke in the last cut. That joke is good enough
to do two times? I was doing a— I was doing a
different version of it. I was riffing. If he has three hours of Brussels,
he won't know he's safe. But if he has three hours
of Brussels, he is screwed.
He's gonna rack up a lot of coins. Oh, sorry. We're screwed. Sorry.
We're screwed. Yeah, the good news is his route, he doesn't have a
super fast route to Borkum. Yeah, actually getting to
Borkum is still quite hard. It's tough. It's tough. He arguably has, I think in my opinion,
the hardest location. Borkum, most people,
we generally agreed that Borkum is the hardest location. Ben really wanted it seemingly though. Yeah, it is weird.
Yeah. I mean, he didn't explain
why, of course, but he seemed excited
by getting more of the full start. No idea why. Maybe he knows
something we don't. Hello, it's Ben reporting
from the woods. There are no updates
from the woods. I'm just gonna hang out here
for a little bit... ...so that I'm safe. One thing that's really funny
about being a Runner... ...is that you have no idea
where the Chasers are. So even though we can't get to
where Ben is for hours, I have to assume
that he is acting as if we're right on his tail, 'cause he
has to assume that we are. He's gotta be so paranoid. I think there's an owl over there. That's kind of fun. Kind of fun owl vibe here. It says he's by the water. Maybe has to wait in the water.
Yeah, it's a possibility. So it seems like he's
doing a challenge. (gasp) Oh! Oh. There was a big spider on me. I don't like it in the woods. This sucks. The train to Lille leaves
at 2:13. I think that's probably
what he's doing. Let's double-check
when we get into Lille. So we'll get to Lille
at 5:07. Yeah, he'll get to Lille
at 3:25. So he'll be there way before us.
Yeah. Off to Lille, again. I think there's a
pretty good chance... ...that they're gonna
ambush me in Lille. But if they're not waiting
there to ambush me, then I just have to make sure that
I minimize my time there as much as possible. Alright, that's our train. We have our platform? Those clouds. Those clouds look fake. We photoshopped those in. Yeah, this is actually all just
very advanced deepfake. You would not believe how much
it cost to CGI all of this in. I mean, that's why we keep trying to
get you to sign up for CuriosityStream. Off... ...to Lille. Oh yeah, he's definitely
out of the station. Yep.
Yep. So he's definitely on
that train to Lille. Yeah, he's on the train to Lille.
That's good for us. Great. He was gonna get to
Brussels at 4:00. He's not gonna get there
until about 6:00. Okay. Good news. It would seem,
I didn't notice this before, but there is a train
from Lille to Brussels that I can actually just barely afford,
that leaves at... ...4:08, which is like... ...a little over half an hour
after I get it. Might have to just do
some evasive action for a half an hour,
while I'm at Lille. We're back in Lille.
We were here yesterday. We're back in Amiens. We're— We're not back
in Lille yet. Sorry. Being a little confused.
We've been in a lot of places. Why did you take the stairs? Exercise. Okay, we've made it to Lille. I have about a half an hour,
a little more than half an hour, before there's a train
to Brussels. So all I have to do...
is not get caught. I don't see Sam and Adam,
so that's good. Alright. Welcome to Amiens. We're here for about
40 minutes. That's the famous Amiens [ah-miens]  Tower. It was built in 1948. It's the only tower in Europe
built by Francis Lloyd Wright. Just to be clear,
none of that is true. Yeah, but it could be true. You don't know for sure.
I'm sure that that's not true. I would imagine
that's probably false. I think I might be safe
if I can make it into a decently big, complex building. What about this building? I mean, look.
It's for New Yorkers. Oh, there's a Lego store. I love Legos. This is a really well-stocked
Lego store. They got Star Destroyers. I gotta focus. I gotta focus. Not gonna buy Legos.
Not gonna buy Legos. I'm just gonna go hide... ...by this bike equipment. Alright. Where's your friend
and mine, Ben Doyle. Okay.
He's in Lille. Big question's gonna be,
does he only stay in Lille for a little bit or
does he stay for a while? You get on the trains
in two and a half hours. Okay. That train leaves
in 15 minutes now, so I'm gonna start carefully making my way back
to the train station. Hopefully... ...they're not waiting
to catch me there. Look, Sam,
it's another ad for... ...Krypto... ...et les Super-Animaux [ani-mel-ey]  Critics hail it as «Hilarant». Okay. I'm exiting the mall. Literally, anytime I see a man in
a hat, I'm like, ""Oh, it's them."" I almost had a heart attack earlier, 'cause I heard someone
running behind me, but it turns out it was a baby. Okay, the train is there. This is literally the same train station
that they caught me by getting on the train
that I was on. So, certainly getting on the train
does not make me any safer. I still don't see them. They could get on the train
any minute. Krypto et les Super-Animaux. You know what this is
in English? Super-Pets, I believe. Right here.
Alright. Platform's there. Some big boy. Ooh, it is a big boy. Look at that big, beautiful boy
that we're about to get on. It's got some girth. Okay, so it shows Ben
on the tracks. In fact, I think the same track
he was on yesterday, when we caught him there. Unfortunately, it does not look like
we'll be catching him there again. (train horn) Whoa. (whispering) The train
is leaving the station. Go Ben. Go Ben.
Go Ben. Go. So the good news is... Ben had... what, an hour and a half
head start on us? But he's taking
slow, regional trains, and we're about to take
a high speed train. So we're gonna cut
that lead by about half. We're in Silly. Look, Sam, it's me! New Yorker.
You're from North Carolina. So Ben just got to Brussels-Midi,
which is where we're going. Looks like he's just outside. So yeah. I wonder
what he's doing next. We'll see him soon. Okay. Welcome to Brussels. It is time to do a challenge, because I am almost
out of budget, and Adam and Sam are
probably right behind me. So... let's go do a challenge. Let's go ahead and pull our card. Card we've got is... ...cursed. ""Roll a die.
Whatever number you roll, ""you must take that number train on the departure board
at your nearest station."" Well, that is very interesting. Let's go ahead and
roll a die, and we're gonna find out
where we are headed next. That is a five. That means we are taking the
fifth train on the departure board, so let's go find out
where we're going. Okay. It looks like the fifth train
on the departure board is Namen/Luik-Guill. Okay. I finally found
this platform. This is the train. Only gonna go... ...one stop on this train. That's gonna take me to
another part of Brussels, which is actually good for me. So this card was awesome. I'm starting to get
a little worried about the timing of our impending tag, because it's 6:23. We're going to get into Brussels
at about 6:50. I'm not sure I can get
anywhere useful, if the tag happens at 7:20-ish,
before the rest period ends. That would mean that the whole
45-minute grace period effectively becomes worthless. So yeah, this could get really awkward
for my next stint as Runner. Oh man, I'm thirsty. I had water earlier, but then
this French teen took it. He walked up to me and
was like, ""Can I have that?"" And I was like, ""I guess."" I— He just took it. Let's pull a card.
And the card is... Find a fancy car. So, okay. I have to find a car that is
worth more than 100,000 Euro. But I know nothing about cars. I have to figure out where
the rich people would be. I've done a little bit of research
and I had a very funny idea. There is a luxury car rental
service at the airport here. And I know that
if I go to the airport, and they're looking at the tracker
and I'm at the airport, they're gonna have a heart attack. 'Cause I think the airport's
also a pretty big train hub. I know we need to hurry.
Is he going to enter or to leave? I'm at the airport. I'm gonna do an impression of
Adam looking at his tracker. ""Oh— Oh my god.
He's at the airport?"" Something like that.
I'm kinda off my game. I'm very tired. He's headed... Where's he going? Oh, he's at the airport! He's like at-at the airport. Let me look
what that could be. Oh, this is it.
He's just trying to confuse us. I think. I doubt he's getting
a flight, right? He can't have the budget.
No, there's no way. Let's figure out our way.
Let's go to the airport. We'll get the exact same
train that he got. This car looks like
it might be nice. Please don't make fun of me
if this car is not nice. It's a C180... ...and it seems like
it is not 100,000 euro. I'll keep looking. This is like a... This like an EV... ...SUV. That might be expensive. No, that car is even less money
than the other car. Track 15. Oh, go— Let's go—
Two, maybe three minutes. Okay. 15's... this way, this way. I know, I know. I'm working on it. No, you're kidding! That was it. Okay, taxi. Really? (anguished shout) Okay. Come on. Let's keep looking.
Let's find a fancy car. This looks like a fancy car. Is this a fancy car? It says Porsche. That's a fancy brand of car. I know that much. Okay. After...
after excessive Googling... I have determined that
this car is a Porsche 911. That is probably not gonna come
as a surprise to many of you who have been screaming
that at your screens, but I figured it out,
and it was very hard for me, so. This car starts at 100,000 dollars. Or 100,000 euros.
Same thing now. Egh. I would say that I have
claimed the fancy car card. Yeah, yeah.
These are taxis. Okay. Well now
I have to decide... ...what it is that
I'm gonna do next. We're getting pretty close
to the end of the day here. And I really can't get very far. I'm probably here in Brussels
for the night. Let's do another challenge. Let's spend the last
50 minutes of our day doing a challenge
and hoping that... ...Adam and Sam don't
manage to track me down. They're probably here by now,
so I should be very careful. Are they headed
to the airport? Maybe. We're so close. We're three minutes away. Oh, come on. Stay there. Our next card is... Eat the national dish. We... are finally in Belgium. And the national dish is frites, which is very fun
and should be very easy. And again, I'm very hungry. Let's go find ourselves
some frites. (indistinct) No, no. Merci, merci. It's showing him in
this far room, but there's multiple levels. He could be on any level.
Very discreet. Okay, they could theoretically
be showing up here at the airport
at any moment, but... I'm kind of juking 'em out,
'cause if they head towards the airport, I'm heading right back towards
the station that they probably arrived at, which is definitely
gonna annoy them. I don't see him.
I don't see him. Did he go up? Let's go up, let's go up. Did it still show him
exactly here? It's also, we're getting near
the end of the day. I don't even know if I'm gonna
have time to have frites. But what I do know is that
I'm probably gonna end my day right around that train station. Which is great because it has
a ton of trains in the morning, so I can get right out
of Brussels right away. He's there, he's there. Ah! Pretty good. You had quite a day.
I had quite a day. Big day for you.
Long day. Just a couple of minutes and
I would've been going right back to the train station that
you probably came from. We have 39 minutes left. Alright, that time's
very valuable to you. So do the—
Exchange the cards. Shuffling the cards. Sam.
Thank you. It is about to be 7:25. We will start chasing you
at 6:10 tomorrow morning. Go.
Bye! That could not have
gone better for me. I'll explain why in a second. Us starting the...
jail period right now, right before the rest period,
where it's gonna get split up, is actually really good for us, 'cause it means that Sam
can't get out of Brussels. He can't get on a train
moving out of Brussels before the rest period starts. Probably not gonna get
another chance on my run. So what I need to do
is I need to go for it. I need to go for (indistinct) I already checked the configuration
one morning, and it's really advantageous
to me from here. So, first thing I'm gonna do,
I need more budget. Right now, I got 4,600 coins. I need more. I calculated it from Paris. I needed about 6,000
to do a safe run. But now I'm in Brussels,
so I'm even further. So... I think I'm gonna do... ...the 250-coin powerup that
doubles the value of the challenge. It also doubles the value of
the veto period. I am screwed if
I have to veto a card. Okay, so... top card. Please let this be good. This determines
whether or not I can go on. Oh no. Touch an animal
that's not a pet. So the animal must be
mouse-sized or bigger. The animal must be alive. The animal may be
in captivity, domesticated, but it may not be attempting
to become a pet. Okay, so a bird, theoretically. I do wonder if there's
a sniffer dog. Because a sniffer dog is
definitely not a pet. Also, I don't know if I
could touch a sniffer dog... ...because it would be
in the hands of police. Like, my best bet
might be like a raccoon? So... The animal must be
mouse-sized or bigger. The animal must be alive. Aren't humans animals? Like... Under any definition,
humans are animals, right? Hey, guys. So you can't move
right now, right? No. And you also can't tag me
right now, right? No, we cannot move
or tag you. Okay, good.
Good clarification. So... I wanted to get
your opinion on a card. Touch an animal that's not a pet. Humans are animals, right? Humans are animals. God dammit!
It's probably our oversight. But you can't tag me
right now. So you're saying
you want to touch us? Yeah. I don't want you to touch me. Yeah. I'm sensitive. I have (indistinct) Oh, whoa! Enjoy the 750 coins. Buy yourself something nice. 750? Or maybe like... He doubled it.
He doubled it. Okay.
We're in trouble. Straight from the horse's mouth. This is what I want, see? I wanna get on that train to Cologne tomorrow morning. I think there's a 6:03,
from what I saw earlier. Yeah, see? Platform one. So I wanna be on platform one when we end this period. Right, so... Sam has 15 minutes
before the rest period. Presumably he is going to
leave this train station. It'd be pretty stupid
for him not to. I am actually on
the platform right now that I need to be on
tomorrow morning. One. Platform one. I think I'm gonna get this. Yeah, I mean, I can get
all the way to Switzerland, I think, before they can catch up. I think we're going to
Zermatt tomorrow. And... I think we're winning
this thing, honestly. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Unfortunately, this season of Jet Lag
is getting pretty close to done. But if you wanna get closer to the finish,
if you wanna get closer to the finale, you can watch the next episode,
episode six, right now, on Nebula. And you'll also be
setting yourself up for the best viewing experience possible
for the rest of the season. That's because every single
episode of Jet Lag goes up one week earlier
than YouTube, on Nebula. And then this season,
what we're doing is we're actually gonna be
releasing an aftershow. This whole big, long special available
exclusive to Nebula subscribers, where we show you some of the
moments that didn't make it into the cut, explain some of the
behind-the-scenes, answer some questions,
explain some strategy. It really is just going to enhance your
Nebula Jet Lag viewing experience. And the reason why we give
Nebula subscribers early access and these exclusives is because the show truly could not
exist financially without them. We know the numbers.
We know what we get from YouTube, and we know what we get
from Nebula. Simply, we would not
break even on YouTube alone. That's because we get paid
when people sign up for Nebula, and paid when people
watch on Nebula. So, it's a great deal, and the reason so many
of you have signed up, I think, is 'cause it's also a
really good deal for you. That's because if you go to
our landing page at CuriosityStream, curiositystream.com/jetlag, you get access to CuriosityStream when you sign up for
any of their subscriptions there, and CuriosityStream
has access to loads of really good documentaries
and nonfiction shows by big names like Jane Goodall
and David Attenborough. Then when you sign up on that page
for any of their subscriptions — monthly, annual, 4K, anything — you get access to Nebula
for free, for as long as you stay
subscribed to CuriosityStream. So it's two streaming sites
for the cost of one, and actually it's a little less
than the cost of one, because also at that page,
you get a discount. It's like $14.79
for the entire year at curiositystream.com/jetlag
right now. So it's two streaming sites
for the cost of one, for the cost of
actually less than a fancy burger or something. And it helps support the show
that hopefully you like. So it's kind of a good deal, so head to
curiositystream.com/jetlag or click the button that's
somewhere on screen right now, and thanks so much
in advance for your support. Bye!"

""Tag Across Europe."" You're watching episode four,
so make sure you're caught up on episodes one through three. Or don't.
I'm just a disembodied voice. To recap, the game ends when
a Runner reaches their end location, or at the end of 72 hours
when the win goes to whoever's end location is
closest to the current Runner. Right now it's the
morning of day two. Ben and I just caught Adam
here in Massy-Palaiseau. That means Ben's the new Runner,
and he has 45 minutes to get outta Paris before
we can start chasing him. The only problem is... getting outta Paris
is gonna take him at least an hour. Okay, I just need
to get on any train. This is not a great spot. There are not that many... ...actual trains out of here. So I think I need to get
on an RER, and get to a better station. I got you a pain au chocolat. Aww! Merci. He's still up there. Okay. I mean, the question is... I'm not sure what he's
going to do. I mean.... He's gotta do a challenge. He doesn't have any money. I think what he's gonna
have to do is go to Paris, and gotta do a challenge
and take evasive action. Alright, so really the only stations
that have trains to the general direction
I wanna be going would be Gare du Nord
or Gare de l'Est. Both of which
are an hour from here. So they're gonna be
chasing me before... ...I even get on a train,
if I can. The station for him that matters
is Gare du Nord. Right, right, yeah.
That's what he has to get to. Or... yeah, Gare du Nord.
I mean... Arguably we could just go
to Gare du Nord, and he would show up there, I bet. And honestly it wouldn't
be the worst idea. Okay. That's my RER. I'm gonna take this... ...and then I gotta transfer once,
and then I'll be at Gare du Nord, and I'm literally just
gonna get on the first train I can get on
once I get there. Has he moved yet? Right here. Let's see. Still there. That's live. You know, Adam and Sam
are over there, probably laughing up a storm,
probably saying, ""Ben's not even gonna get outta Paris.
He just got on a train."" First of all, that's the
best I could do, okay? Second of all, at least I'm
not wearing a wig. Ben is very far from his location. He's the furthest of all of us
from his location right now, and I'm almost certain
he has the least coins. Yeah, I think we'll be able
to get him relatively quickly. So I've looked at
my train options, and... ...there's a 9:07 to Amiens. I would just barely make it
to the station by then... ...and be cutting it real close. But there's a 9:19... to a place called Saint-Quentin.[sahn-quen-tin] I'm mispronouncing that.
I'm very sorry. But that is my direction.
I can afford that train. And it would line up
pretty nicely with my schedule. Where's he going? North? Yeah, north.
Into the city? Okay, good. I think that's what we want. We've got what, another
20-something minutes? Yeah. So about 20, 23 minutes,
24 minutes. Yeah. I don't think... ...that Adam and Sam
would be able to catch me in the station...
before I got on that train. I mean, obviously it's very close. But that's exciting content, so. That's the best I can do for you. Go!
Okay, okay. Okay. I got it.
Got em? Over here.
Two minutes until we leave. Okay. Incredible work. Made it to... Saint-Michel. Now I'm gonna dilly-dally
a little bit here because the longer I can go
without them knowing... ...which station I'm going to... ...you know, a better of a shot
I have getting out of Paris. And look, let's be honest. It would be embarrassing
if I didn't get outta Paris, right? Ben will know that
going to Gare du Nord is the very obvious place
for him to end up. He knows that we know that that is
the most likely place for him to go. It's possible that he will instead
attempt to go anywhere else. Maybe that he knows
that we know. Okay, I've made it to Gare du Nord. It's 9:07, so I've missed
the train to Amiens. But it's fine, because... ...the train to Saint-Quinton[sahn-ken-tawn]—
Quint—[kint] Please forgive me, is better. Anyway, because
it's a much smaller hub, so I think it's gonna— they're gonna have
more trouble getting there, assuming that...
the train leaves with me on it before they get here,
which is not a guarantee. So now I've just gotta figure
out where that train is. He's at Gare du Nord. My guess is he will get on
whatever train he can afford just to get out of Paris.
Can't imagine there'll be much. It's thirteen. Thirteen. Okay. Thirteen.
Thirteen's over there. Oh, I just gotta get on this train. Hey, we just missed it. Wait, did we?
Yeah, it left at 9:30. Agh! Let's get on this train. It turns out that asking,
""Where is train? Where is train?"" in broken French
in a French train station... is not very helpful,
but I did make it on the train. So I'm just praying that it leaves
before Sam and Adam get here. How long will this take
to get us there? Pretty quick. It's only one stop
before Gare du Nord. So, I think we have a good shot
of catching him right away. Wow. Poor Ben. This is us. This is a problem. But there are no other trains
I could get on right now. And I already spent my budget
on this train. So I just have to pray the train
isn't delayed a full 20 minutes. Oh gosh! Alright. We're here. Is he still at this station? Yep. Okay, it still shows him
in the station. (conductor speaking French) I don't know what she said, but I hope it was, like,
""We're going."" I hope that's French for,
""We're heading out."" We're not. So the name of the game: Let's not get seen.
Let's methodically search. We need to see him
before he sees us. But this is tough,
doing an indoor search. Yeah.
Because the tracker is not accurate. It's not accurate, and also...
this whole place is huge. Yeah, massive.
And a labyrinth. Okay, I've got my backpack on. If I see them
coming down the train, I'm just gonna... hop off and... ...speedy-walk away. I don't think that's
gonna get me very far, but I don't have
any other options right now. Like, just to give you a sense
of what's happening: There are stairs. There are... This is massive—
...like plat— This is one of the biggest
train stations in Europe. And I bet you anything he's doing
everything he can not to be found. (whispering) Three minutes. I'm sweating. But he must be doing
a challenge. I guess. So... He's probably— We should definitely
be looking at shops and stuff. There are a lot of shops, so. This place is huge. The train is moving. Oh, I really didn't think I was
gonna make it outta here. It's looking good for Team Ben. This is gonna be
a lot harder than I thought. Yeah. Oh no, he left. No! Nooo! Where's he going?
What train just left? Can we look at that? I didn't. I saw one that didn't
show up on Google. Crap! It was a P. I forget what it was.
It was something with a P. No, it's too late
'cause it already left. And it's not showing it.
Something with a P. Something with a P? Okay, well let's look at all
the lines that leave from here. It looks like I'm gonna get into... ...Saint-Quinton[saint cue-taw(n)]... ...at around 11, and
according to what I can find, it seems like Sam and Adam
probably can't get there until at least 1:30, but... Look, they're smart.
I'm sure they can figure out some clever, crazy way
to get there earlier than that. So I don't want to
stick around quite that long. He's not on this route,
out Paris Nord. He's on this route.
But that's worse because— That's bad, 'cause there's four different routes
that go that way. Maybe it's one of these.
Ooh! I don't know what this H is,
but it goes to Persan. It goes to Persan?
Okay, okay, okay. 9:36. That's what he got.
Yeah, 9:36. That's gotta be it. Okay.
Well, hmm... No, I think that's right. My strategy this time around is
I'm gonna try and go... ...from relatively small city
to relatively small city. Because I think they're just
gonna have trouble predicting where I'm going
and actually getting to the little towns where I am... ...than if I were in
a bigger city like Lille, which has a lot of ways
to get there. I don't know if this strategy
will work, but we'll see. We just missed a train to Persan, Like one minute. It was at 10:01.
No! No! It's at 10:02. That sucks. Well, 10:34, so we have
30 minutes. Let's get tickets. Alright, tickets.
Here's that. Wait a minute. (indistinct) Wait, that's not Persan.[person] Let me go back to the map.
He's way past Persan. (bleep) Mmmh, there was a 9:44... ...to Compiègne.
Left late. Yeah, it left a few minutes late. But that makes sense. 'Cause we were surprised
he stayed here so long. Yeah. And that was— Okay, let's check
how we could get there. There's a 10:34.
Let's get towards that. So... Fifteen?
Yeah. Oh, nice. Man. Close the door and
look antisocial. Yep, we go through Tergnier.
Yeah. So we're going on the
exact same route. That's perfect. Okay, great. Okay. Bienvenue à... ...this place. I don't have a lot of time. It's nearly 11, and I want
to get on a 12:15 train, So... I'm gonna go try and
pull a card as soon as I can. And hopefully it's
something I can... ...manage to do here
in under an hour. We will get there, assuming
we're not also delayed, at 12:16. That's a good hour. Yeah, that's an hour,
an hour-fifteen. So he knows when
he has to get out of there. Probably. I mean, there's always a question
of if he'll be able to earn the coins
to keep moving anyway. In order to get on
almost any train, I have to earn some more.
So, it's time to pull a card. Oh. Eat the national dessert. We are in France, so the dessert
we've chosen is profiteroles. I think profiteroles are
pretty common. I bet they're somewhere
here that I can get them. I'm gonna do some research
and look around. It's not a huge town. So hopefully,
it's not too far away. And also I'm pretty hungry again. So, I could really use some
profiteroles. That sounds lovely. Okay, see you in a minute. What are you doing, Sam? I'm uploading Jet Lag! We're filming this as season two
is still going out. What episode's going up today? This is episode four,
releasing on YouTube, the finale releasing on Nebula. Hey, did you know that the episodes
go up one week early on Nebula and you can sign up
for just $14 and— So, I did a little bit of research. It seems like there's
a pastry shop that's literally right across
the bridge here, like three minutes away. So hopefully they have
profiteroles. I don't think that profiteroles
are that uncommon. It's like every little town
you go to in this country is like the most beautiful place
you've ever seen. I mean, look at this. Oh my god! Oh my god. He's on the move, folks! Looks like he's going into the city.
So he is doing a challenge. Which is good,
'cause that means he... ...doesn't have the budget,
and needs to earn budget, but is bad because
it means he's earning budget. Bonjour. Vous avez des profiteroles? Profiteroles? No? Merci. They did not have profiteroles. And I've been looking at other places
that might have profiteroles. and I found a restaurant
that has them, but it doesn't open until noon. And if I go there
and try and get profiteroles, I don't think I'm gonna
make that 12:15 train. I think my best bet
right now is... ...to veto the card,
eat the veto period, and just hope I am able to do a
quick one before I get out of here. What I'm really worried about is the fact that Ben has a
12:16 train to Amiens, which is exactly when
we're supposed to get in. So I don't think we could
make that connection. But good news is we get into the station before Saint—
Saint-Quentin... ...which is called Tergnier... ...at about 12:10, I think. And there seems to be
a 12:26 to Amiens. From there, it would get in
only 15-20 minutes after him. That seems promising.
That seems promising. The only problem is
we would get to this station, we would get to the decision point, before he would get on
the train to Amiens. The only other possibility,
and this would be another mistake, is like, this train is actually a
really quick way to get to Brussels. Right, but if we got out, if we did our plan of
getting off early... Yeah. ...he could get on this train... Yeah, because
we're gonna have to... ...and get to Brussels.
We're gonna have to get off this before. It's almost— It's a situation where
I think it would be a mistake, because he probably thinks we're
on this train to Saint-Quentin. But if he makes that mistake,
he might actually win, or get away
if we do our move. So it's like, oof. Oh god.
Let's get ready. Oh god, oh god.
Should we get off? I don't—
I think— O-O-Okay. Hold on. There's a bee. My veto period is complete. I've been doing some thinking
and here's what I'm gonna do. If I can't complete this next challenge,
I'm stuck here either way. I just— I don't have
enough to get outta here. So... I can't veto the next card
or I get caught either way. So in that spirit,
I'm going to buy... ...the powerup that doubles
my next reward or my next veto penalty. Because... I guess my next veto penalty
is gonna screw me either way. And with that active, I'm gonna
go ahead and pull my next card. (despondent chuckle) Oh no. Okay, estimate your city's population. I only have one guess, and if
I am off by more than 25%, this card is automatically vetoed. The good thing is this is a
really quick one and it rewards a lot. The bad thing is that there's a very
good chance that I get this wrong, because I am not very smart. Okay, we're basically there.
We gotta decide. Oh god.
We have to get off here. Okay, you know Ben better. Can you get— If he went to Amiens,
where would he go next? He would go—
Like, is there anything good? I don't know. We don't have
time to look it up. I— Look, it's a total guess, but my guess is that
he would go to Amiens. Okay. We need to get off then.  (groan) Okay. Okay. Just so that you're clear
on what we're doing. We have just gotten off
a stop before Saint-Quentin, which is where Ben is,
because there is a better train here that goes to Amiens,
which is where we think he's going. But... He could actually have
a really good route to Brussels by just getting on this exact train
when it gets to Saint-Quentin. We are hoping that he
won't do that, because he'll think that
we're on it. But if he doesn't realize
that we should be on it... Yeah.
...then he'll get on it. That was just like a pure
flip-a-coin kind of thing. Oh, it is... It really could go either way. Yeah. It's like three levels of game theory. Yeah. I've been walking around
a little bit. I'd like to think that
I've given myself... ...some perspective, but... ...unfortunately... ...I don't think it helps
very much at all. So I think I just have to
put in a guess. I'm just— The number 60,000
is calling to me. So that means the population
is between 45,000 and 75,000. Then I will be correct, and otherwise
the card gets automatically vetoed, and I'm in a one hour
veto penalty. Which would be rough. So let's find out if I was right. Comment below if
I'm a (bleep)-ing idiot. Oh, my friends. Oh, Team Ben. The number that is coming up
is 55,000. But that is within the
correct range, which means I just got
2,000 freaking coins. And that means...
What time is it? It's 11:53. I have time to get on that train to (bleep). I can't believe I got that right. Okay. Okay. ♪ Oh my god, oh my god,
I'm getting on the train ♪ ♪ I'm the best at this... game ♪ ♪ Sam and Adam are gonna lose ♪ ♪ I'm going all the way to Borkum ♪ Okay. He's at the train station. We will not know for
fifteen minutes which way he's going. There's the train leaving that Ben
hopefully is not about to get on. God, if he gets on the train
that we were just on, that we got off...
I would be so frustrated. Oh my god. Gun to my head,
I thought this was the right call. Yeah. And standing off the train now,
I don't regret my decision. Okay, little gameplay update.
I got a little pain au chocolat. I'm here ten minutes before
the train's here. I'm feeling good. I don't think that Adam or Sam
could be close, but you never know. I'm so stressed. Ugh, I hope we
made the right decision. Alright, off to... Wait until it's made
some real movement. I mean, it's... Oh, no. It's starting to go north
a little bit. I will say that. Yeah, it's still in the station.
It could just be GPS error. But it's pretty consistent. No, oh no.
No, no, no! No! No! No! Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus If you wanna see how colossally
Adam and I messed up, then good news: you can
watch the episode right now if you're a Nebula subscriber. If you're not a Nebula subscriber,
well, listen to this, because it's actually a
really good deal. Every single episode we put out
one week early on Nebula, because the Nebula subscribers
quite literally bankroll this channel. We do all the accounting.
This channel would not break even if it was just for YouTube stuff. We rely on Nebula. We rely on our
Nebula subscribers to fund this. And so that's why we put
the episodes up one week early. And yeah, so you can see
episode five right now. But there's also tons of
other good stuff there, like... Oh yeah, there's all the Originals
that we've made, like... ...this one... ...that one... and there's also all the other Originals
that all sorts of other creators have made. Including RealLifeLore,
Real Engineering, the two guests in the first two
seasons of this, and plenty more. And then what's even crazier is that
the best way to get access to Nebula, the best as in cheapest —
in fact, it's cheaper than just going through the front door

it's another streaming site, which has lots of longform
documentaries and shows and nonfiction STEM stuff. Definitely the kind of thing that
slightly nerdy people that like... that like that kind of content
would enjoy. We've even made some stuff
for them you can find on there. And plenty of others too. So it's a crazy good bundle deal. Not only do you get
a streaming site where you can watch Jet Lag

""Tag Across Europe."" You're watching episode three,
which means you either missed two episodes or
you've already skipped this recap. Just as a reminder, in order to win, you have to reach your designated
finish location while you're the Runner. If no one reaches their destination
by the end of the two remaining days, then the win goes to
whoever's location is closest to the Runner
when the clock runs out. Right now, Adam is in Paris
trying to earn enough coins to take a train to Rennes
tomorrow morning. Thanks to pulling a Curse Card that means
he can't use his phone anymore, Adam had to veto his last challenge,
which means for the next 30 minutes, he can't take any form of
transportation. To make matters worse,
Ben and I are minutes away from his location. I've lost his location. It looked like he was maybe moving. Oh no wait, it looks like
he's on Île de la Cité. Isn't that towards us?
Yeah. He literally could be anywhere. The tracker's showing me like
a massive radius right now. Well, that seems to suggest—
What is he wearing again? He's wearing like a...
little flannel shirt. Part one of the disguise... ...is this soccer football jersey. I never wear soccer football jerseys. Totally not my thing. I've got a wig. I got this bucket hat. I think if I'm like this in the subway,
I might be fine now. You're probably thinking, ""Well, Adam, what about your giant,
super recognizable backpack?"" That's a great point. And that's exactly why I
brought something for that... ...exact reason— (speaking in French) What's that?
Oui? I don't speak French. I'm sorry. I— I only speak English. Good to meet you. Let's move. I'll keep looking. What was he wearing again? I brought a trash bag, so I'm
gonna put my bag in the trash bag. Alright. I'm gonna take my microphone off, 'cause I think that is too obvious. And I'm gonna take
the phone off the tripod. Oh, there are too many people. It's good for us. It's good for us too, right.
It makes it hard to spot us. Especially 'cause he's not looking, but... He's somewhere here. Maybe he's spotted us
and jumped in the Seine. I'm assuming that they're
on their way to my location now. That being the case,
I think it's time for me to take... ...my spot...
in the giant subway. I just have to survive... ...for 20 more minutes... and I can take a subway
somewhere. I just think the tracker
is not very accurate. So I think we just need to be
searching these streets with them. Heyo! It's John Green! What the (bleep)? What? John Green. We're filming Jet Lag!
Hey buddy! Hi! Hi!
Hi John Green! Oh my God.
How are you guys doing? Great. We're looking for Adam.
Oh my god. We are searching for Adam.
I haven't seen Adam. People are gonna think
this is a scripted cameo! This is not a scripted bit.
Oh my god! That's my friend. I know him.
Oh my god, John Green. You're filming, right?
Yeah. I've come from a
champagne wine tour. We've come from ten, twelve
hours of trains all day. We're very exposed. And Adam is like right here.
Godspeed. Do you have any advice
for us finding him? None. We gotta go. When are you gonna be on this, John? Okay bye, John Green!
Bye, John! Just by the way, this
disguise is unbelievably hot. It's already hot
in this subway station. This is like low-key unbearable. What just happened?
I don't know. It was John Green. That— That was not scripted. We can't worry about
John Green right now! We need to get outta the— We're halfway between buses. Okay, watch out, watch out. That was amazing. We knew John Green was in Paris,
'cause he tweeted about it, and we were like, it'd be so funny
if John Green cameo'd on Jet Lag. (wheezing) I was like,
""That doesn't sound like Adam!"" That was genuinely
one of the strangest things that has ever happened! Okay, okay.
Concentrate, concentrate. We can think about
how unbelievable that is... Okay, so it shows Adam
back in the river, but I think the majority of the time,
the tracker showed in these streets. So I think we need to
spend our time searching. It would make sense that
the tracker would not be accurate in such dense crowds. Yes. So let's methodically
search these streets. He's gonna be so mad about it, losing his shot to meet
his hero, John Green. I know, well... he shoulda
gotten tagged sooner. Alright. Only three minutes left.
I think I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna start
heading towards any subway. Just get on and peace out. (distant live saxophone) Yeah, let's advance
kind of behind the cars. Oh no, there's a subway exit,
entrance up there. He could be going into that. We're like right there. Okay. Well, it looks like he's in the block. Like he's in a building. Yeah. I mean, again, just like,
it's not that accurate. Well, could he have gone down to
that subway station, maybe? Just by the way, I'm not
cheesing the GPS by doing this. I have service. I checked my tracking phone
just to make sure I had service. I didn't do anything else
with them, but... I'm not like making it so that
they can't find me without service. I have service.
It's just, this is a maze. So I think it's fair game. Okay. Okay. What does the tracker say now? So, it's back to that location. It's back to that location
in the river right there. So I think we need to
covertly scan that area. Oh, he can't be
on that boat, can he? It shows him in the river.
Here, Apple Maps now says it too. But he...
Why would he be on a boat? Alright, I have to wait a little bit
for the train I'm taking. So I'm hiding in a little corner. I'm gonna pull a card really quick. (sigh) Do a hundred squats. ""For a full squat, your thighs
must be parallel to the ground. You may move or rest
between squats."" Okay. No time like the present, I guess. There's no way that he's
on a boat, but he could... There's a Métro station
that goes under the Seine, right? Yeah, but he's been there
for a while. Could it be worth just...
going down there and checking? Just not sure why he would've
been there for that long. Yeah, 'cause we've been here
for a good fifteen minutes, and it's like rush hour. So I can't imagine any trains... (sneeze) ...would've taken longer than
fifteen minutes to come here. So I'm not sure why he would
be in the Métro station. Maybe he was being indecisive. Maybe. There's so many people
getting on this train. Uh-oh, oh no. Both trackers moved. Okay, trackers moved east. Okay.
Towards Gare de Lyon. Should we go there? I mean he's east, so
he's not here anymore. I don't know if he's going to Gare de Lyon,
but he's going that way. Oh man, it takes two different... Ah (bleep)! Alright, let's go, let's go. Where would he have been here? He's like almost all the
way to Gare de Lyon now. Well, we should go there too. I mean, if he's trying to set
himself up to take a train first thing in the morning...
Yeah, we gotta be there. I have no idea where I am! Okay. He's gone past the station. What I think that means is
I think he's taken RER. Oh yeah.
He's on the RER yellow line. Where does that take him? Just away, away from the city. Where am I? I'm at the Bibliothèque, here. So tomorrow,
I just want to take the C... ...all the way down to
Massy-Palaiseau. That feels doable,
but I don't wanna do it now. 'Cause I'm worried that
they'll figure out my plan. Mmh, okay. Here's what would be
a good move. So... the RER C line
goes to Massy. And in Massy, there is... There are TGVs to Rennes.
Let's look in the morning. Okay. Only a half hour until
the rest period starts. If I can last until then... ...that'll be a really good
starting place. Alright, let's see how many squats
I can do right off the bat. Where could he be going? He's showing as being at
Bibliothèque François Mitterrand. I think let's get on the one,
and get off at Gare de Lyon, unless we can figure out
something's changed. Just to get towards him for now.
Right. 'Cause we're only 29 minutes
until the rest period. That is a potential place
where we could intercept him. Yeah. I think I have about ten-ish
minutes where I'm still safe. So... One. Two. He's still there. Here's our train. We're headed to Gare de Lyon. Fourteen. Fifteen. Is he still there?
Yep. Still there. I mean, we could just
try and get as physically close to him
as possible. I guess that's probably
the best bet at this point. So we'll get out there,
and we can cross that bridge and then run down
that street maybe. Yeah. I mean, maybe we could
get him, I don't know. 21. 22. You know what, I'm gonna make this
be more out of the way. I'm blocking people. 23. 24. 25. You know, I don't like
my back being turned. We have eleven minutes.
It says it's a seventeen minute walk. I think this way's better. Can you just get
as close as possible? 68, 69, 70. You know,
I was not in the meeting where this challenge was
come up with, I was on vacation. And I remember seeing it
afterwards and being like, ""Hey Ben, a hundred squats? That seems like a lot!"" And he was like, ""It'll be fine."" 31. Whew. Seventy— 72, 73. Where do we have to go?
Where is he? Okay, actually this one. 87, 88, 89, 90. Okay. Ten more.
Almost there. God, I hope they don't
show up right now! 'Cause I am not
gonna be able to run! Is he still there? Yeah, we need to get down. Down? 98, 99, 100. It's like the dumbest thing
we've ever come up with. Alright, that's another 500 coins. That's more than enough to safely get me
all the way to Saint-Malo. He's over that bridge? Yeah. I am gonna go ahead
and draw my next card here. Here's the deck, and here's the top pick. ""Go exactly one mile. ""Close your eyes, spin in a circle,
and point in a random direction. ""You must go as close as possible, ""on publicly accessible land,
to that location exactly one mile in that direction."" Well... Um. Adam is down there. Down there? Okay. It's that way. What's that way? It takes me around
fifteen minutes to walk a mile. So I'm just gonna go about
fifteen minutes in that direction. I really hope that the
audience feels that this is an appropriate interpretation
of the challenge. I am doing my very best. Should we hide? Well, he's still far away, but I think we might wanna
stay on this side. 'cause you see, he moved from— Here, you wanna show?
Yeah. He moved from there to there.
So I think he's gonna cross. It's a big river here. It's very pretty. That's cool. Okay yeah,
he's crossing the bridge. Okay. I look so stupid! The wall comes to an end! This is taking embarrassingly long! Thought I saw Sam and Ben. I think it was just
a jogger or something. Oh, that's it. That's it. It's 8 PM. We're done. Oh my god. Okay. This is a great spot. We're very close to Adam. Okay, so let's show
where Adam is. So we're there. Adam just went there.
So that's his spot. ""12th Arr.
Rue de L'Ambroisie."" This sign... is sandwich sign. I'm gonna be exactly here. What I like this spot is... we can cut him off there,
if he's going to go to Gare de Lyon. And pretty much all the transit
is from Gare de Lyon. So I like our spot. So these are the spots that we're
gonna start at at 6 AM tomorrow. Yeah. Okay! But here's the thing,
we gotta go. Cause he's probably gonna
go to the same hotels as us. We don't want him to spot us now. (bleep)
So let's go back. Okay. Good night, everyone.
Good night. Okay.
Good morning. The second it turns six,
we gotta run. We gotta run that way. So Adam is one block that way
and one block that way. Yeah, so we gotta cross the street
and get one block in just as quickly as possible. Oh, it's 6:00. Let's go. Okay, we're back on.
First thing's first. I don't want to do this,
but I am vetoing the walk one mile card.
I've thought about it. And I just think
I cannot accurately get to exactly one mile away
without using my phone. And if I can't do that, I don't think
that I can actually complete the card. That sucks though.
I really don't want to veto it, because that again means that
I'm a sitting duck for the next half hour. I can't take any forms of transportation. Do you have his location? Yeah. It looks like he might be going
down this way towards this street. We sure? Well, 'cause he was like here, I think. Now he's like here. Okay, let's wait for a movement. I'm trying to get on a
7:40-something train at a place called
Massy-Palais— something that I researched before I wasn't
allowed to use my phone anymore. It's like a weird train station
that's really out of the way. You have to get to it on the subway. If I can get on that train, pretty sure I can get
all the way to Saint-Malo, which is only one stop
away from getting to Jersey. Let's cross this way. The question is, does he turn
towards us or cross the bridge? Oh no, he's crossing the bridge.
Let's go. Yeah. Oh, he's going to...
not the station that we thought. That's so weird. Maybe he was trying
to throw us off yesterday... when he was going the opposite direction
from the station he wanted. (reject buzzer) (reject buzzer) Okay. For some reason, the tickets that
I bought yesterday are not working. I need to find a way
to buy new tickets. But I don't know if I can do that. 'Cause my debit card doesn't
seem to be working, because I think my bank thinks
there's fraud on my card, 'cause I'm buying things in Europe. And I cannot call my bank to tell them
there is not fraud on my card, because I cannot use my phone! We just gotta hope that
the RER doesn't come in like the next five minutes. But our chances are good,
'cause it's early. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Purchase tickets. Come on. One ticket.
Just one ticket. Please dear god, work. Come on. They didn't take it. It's not taking it. This is not good. It's gonna be right down there. There's a train coming. It's this direction.
Okay, you go that way. I'll go this way. Box him in. Excuse me.
Could you swipe me in? I can give you 10 euros,
but my card's not working. Could you swipe me through? Money?
Yeah, I only have cash. Okay. Thank you. He definitely wasn't on there. I walked from side to side. Is he still back there? Yeah, but in a big circle. Okay, let's go... I don't know where he'd go. Or if he even got on anything. Okay. Just gotta go to the C. There's so many different Cs.
I know I wanna go south. So just gonna hope for the best. There's one at 6:31.
That's really good. That's the exact time
I wanted there to be. Okay, come on. I mean, there's a chance
he's still in the station. Mm-hmm. Okay, I'm hanging out at the
top of these stairs here, 'cause I'm hoping that'll
make the GPS look weird. And also because if they show up,
I have good exit options. He moved again
on the tracker for me. Do you think we should
go above ground? Like he moved
further down the street. I mean, we could go,
but his tracker is far too big for him
to be above ground. I don't know if we can trust that. We haven't validated that at all. It seems like his tracker's
just not very accurate. 'Cause it keeps bouncing. So do you think we should
go above ground? I guess so. Okay. I mean, I just tried
taking this guy one stop. Wait at the next station
for the next train. Okay, this is not where
I intended to go, but this is an option. I just saw myself in the window.
I look so stupid. Alright. Train's left. God, I hope this is
going the right way. No movement? No, I got some movement. Now it shows him here. Oh (bleep),
he went the other way. So which—
He's on the RER. Okay. How do we get on that? I don't know if we want to get on it. Let's see if we can figure out
where he's going and cut him off. Okay. We're on the move. So far, so good. Yeah, that's the RER yellow line. That doesn't go anywhere useful. Goes to Orly. Yeah, but there's—
I don't think there's any flight that would get him anything useful. Yeah, Rennes doesn't have
a flight from Orly. London? Saint-Malo doesn't have
a flight from Orly. That's hypothetically possible,
but would he have the money? The only thing I could imagine is the TGV to Brest and Rennes
from Massy at 7:47. But that's an hour from now. Well, if he's doing that,
then we have time to catch up. I mean, that's on the yellow line,
so that's like a smart move. I mean, he is headed that way. Just taking that unbelievably
stupid wig off for a second. It's so hot! Oh man. I keep looking around.
I know they're not on here. I mean, I don't know,
but I'm pretty sure. I think we have to assume
he's going to Massy. Yeah, could we— I mean, that's the smartest move. Let's go to Massy,
'cause it's one hour until a train to exactly where he wants to go. Okay. Okay. Calling an Uber. Okay, so we have to exit—
You try first. (reject buzzer) Oh god! Ugh, why is there—
There's no human! Can't I just go through with you? Then you'd get in trouble. No, I mean, if we're exiting that... Well, we can exit anyway.
I think the exits are here. (distant buzzer) Oh, they just did that. Okay.
Get right behind me. Okay, come on. Uber there. Here Ben, come on. Okay, this is Juvisy. I think this is gonna be fine. So, according to this... ...train will be here in 11 minutes. And it does go to Massy-Palaiseau. So, so far so good. It must be stuck. I mean, he's been at
this Juvisy station for a couple of minutes. Seems like we have a decent bit
of time before Adam gets here. Yeah.
This is where he's headed. Let's take a look. Well, a good, good period
to get into position. I wonder what Sam and Ben's
plan is right now. Are they trying to get here? Or, and this would be
unfortunate. Have they figured out that
I'm going to Massy-Palaiseau? That wouldn't be good. 'Cause they might be able
to beat me there. But I don't think
they could, actually. Oui.
Merci. The RER C. That's the one that Adam
is heading here on. We should find the exits and then try to block off
as many as possible. And catching him
before he notices us. Yep. I think that's it. Alright. On the train to Massy-Palaiseau. Alright, I think
we might be able to do this. It looks like this might be quite good, 'cause it looks like
this might be the only exit. You see? It seems like there's a big choke point. Let's verify that. How far is he? Looks like he... He's still got some ways.
Okay. Gosh, it's so pretty. And made even prettier by the fact
that Ben and Sam aren't here. Okay. I think he's on the C,
towards Versailles. It must be the 7:25. So we have twelve minutes. Alright. Massy-Palaiseau is the next stop. So... The train, I know,
left 7:40-something, which means they're gonna have
about 25 minutes to try to get to me. Once they realize I'm stopped there. I don't think they could make that,
but we'll see. We knew Adam would be
getting in on these tracks. And the only exit was up these
stairs into this long walkway. So our plan was simple:
box him in. We should do the
box-him-in strategy. Post up here? Well, one of us posts up
behind that and stays hidden. One of us posts up on
the other side of this hallway, and then as soon as he goes in,
we start kind of closing in on him. Okay, so let's get on like a call.
So we can coordinate. Test, test. Can you hear me? Yeah.
Okay. Alright. We made it into Massy-Palaiseau. This is absolutely huge. It looks like... ...on the tracker that
he's pulling in right now. Oh, there's a train pulling in. Okay, so that must be it. You see that? That must be it.
Yeah. Okay. Alright, now's the moment. Unless they can get here
in the next 25 minutes... ...I'm making it to Saint-Malo today. Alright.
Are passengers getting off yet? It doesn't seem like
there's a huge influx yet. But now people
are starting to come out. Okay, I can see
the platform from here. I have not yet seen Adam. Alright. Let's find out when that
train actually does leave. Alright. People are really starting
to come out now. And you have him on the tracker?
He's definitely here now? He is here. Okay. Can I find the right ticket
to get out of here? Let's find out. Oh, I... I see him. I see him. I see him.
I see him. I see him. I see him. Oh, he's wearing—
No, he's wearing a green shirt. Green shirt. What color hat? He's not wearing a hat. Okay. Let's try this one. (reject buzzer) Does not like that. I think he's having trouble. Can't let him get it back on the RER.
Yeah, he's having trouble. He's having trouble
getting through the gates. Hates that, okay. Oh, nice. He's wearing a green shirt.
No hat. What do I do?
Is he in disguise? What... do I do here? He must have bought the wrong ticket. 'Cause yeah, when you go
further outside of the city center, you need a ticket that...
for like the outside zones. Excuse me? You can't just get the
one-year regular one. So that's gotta be what he did. That's gonna take him many— He's probably gonna have to
find a human for that. I can't. It won't. I don't know how to get through. Okay, it's not good tickets. Okay, how do I get—
I have a bunch. Claim doesn't change. I'm gonna back up. Oh. Yeah, he's totally in disguise. He's wearing a shirt
that he would never wear. Thank you. He's just getting through now.
Someone just let him through. Okay. He's going down the bridge. Okay.
I'm following. Okay, let me know
when he is far enough in that he can't get back to you
faster than you can cut him off. Alright. Okay? These are subways. (terrified shout)
(chuckle) You got him?
I got him. Oh, that sucks so much! No! Woo-hoo-hoo! No! How did you know
I was coming here? 'Cause Sam is a train genius. (groan) I was so sure that this was like,
you weren't gonna know about this. I have so much footage of you
struggling to get through this thing. Ugh, you're in disguise,
you bastard. What is this shirt? Shut up. Is that a wig? Adam has a wig. Is this a wig? This is a wig. Oh my god. Come on over here, Sam. Oh god.
That's so frustrating. I really thought I had it. You were so close to leaving Paris. I just was so sure
that you were gonna think I was gonna go not funny with that. Yeah. I mean, again,
there were... lots of times— And also,
how did you beat me here? 'Cause the fastest way here I took, which was the frigging C. Fastest train. Did you take—
or did you cab here? Maybe. Where's his wig?
I wanna see your wig. That's hilarious. (laughs) Oh my god, we're about to be
on Google Street View. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Jet Lag feature! Ugh, I was so— There's— I'm gonna look like
such an idiot in the edit, 'cause there's all this footage
of me being like, ""Alright, I got here.
I'm feeling really good."" ""Now that I'm here, I think
there's no way that they could get..."" Oh, that will be so good. Agh, okay. Alright, I'm doing a final shuffle. Okay Ben, it is... 7:46.
7:46. Which means that at 8:31... ...we'll start coming after you. Godspeed!
Bye, gentlemen. Good luck. Goodbye! See you in Borkum! Yep. I think he's screwed.
I don't think he has any points. This episode of Jet Lag is
unfortunately over. However, you can watch the
next episode right now on Nebula. That's in appreciation
of the fact that this show literally could not exist financially without
everyone who signed up for Nebula. So they get every episode
one week early, always one week ahead
of YouTube. Right after that, of course,
you should watch Crime Spree. That was kind of our
pilot season of Jet Lag. We made it before we even
called it Jet Lag: The Game. And it was before we figured out all the health and safety
rules that we needed. So it's kind of the most
chaotic season of Jet Lag ever. I would definitely give it a watch.
It's absolutely as fun, but a little bit maybe less polished
than the rest of the Jet Lag seasons. And then right after that,
you can watch Extremities. That's another series we make,
and we make this whole show about how and why the world's
most remote human settlements exist. You know, these places
that are some of the hardest places in the world to go to. Then right after that, there's this
documentary on CuriosityStream. It's called
Rent A Family, Incorporated. It's about this agency in Japan
that rents out actors to serve as fake family members
in different social situations. It's a really interesting documentary.
It's bizarre. It's fascinating. But the good news is all of this,
both CuriosityStream and Jet Lag, is available through a bundle deal
with a special offer for Jet Lag viewers at
curiositystream.com/jetlag. If you go to that link,
our link, you get both streaming sites
for an entire year, for just $15 — actually
a little bit less — $14.79. That's a crazy good deal,
and believe it or not, that actually really helps
support us financially. This show only exists
because of how many people have gone and signed up
for that bundle deal. So make sure to click
the button on screen, or head to
curiositystream.com/jetlag. You get access to both streaming sites
for less than $15 a year. And you'll be supporting us,
so thanks in advance for your support. Check ""Massey train station""
for Street View, to tell us if we—
tell us if we made it. Let me see. Even if it's years
in the future, check. Tell us if we made it on
Google Street View, please."

""Tag Across Europe."" This is episode two, so go
watch episode one if you wanna... ...know what happened
in episode one. But just as a refresher,
in order to win, the Runner must reach their designated
end location before getting caught. If no one reaches their location
by the end of three days, then it all comes down to
whose location the Runner is closest to when the clock runs out. Earlier today, Adam and I
caught Ben in Lille, which means that I'm the runner now. I took the first train up to Calais,
which is away from my location, but it bought me some time
to do some challenges and earn some budget for later. Ben and Adam, the Chasers,
are heading up to Dunkirk, hoping that they can
cut me off there. Okay... Here we go again.
Another card pull. This has been really easy. Oh no...! Ugh, god dammit, okay. Similar to the last one,
it makes onward stuff harder. Now I'm gonna have to lug
everything around tote bag style. So... ...let me go find a tote bag. We're off. We switched seats, since we raided
where people weren't talking. Oh yeah, we realized—
Show the little guy. We realized that there's
this little guy in each car, and he tells you whether
you can talk or not. Yeah, and we were in a place where
you seemingly weren't allowed talk at all. Yeah, the guy was saying,
""Shut the (bleep) up."" Uh-huh! So, the card specifically says that
any bag that you carry with handles like a tote bag
counts as a tote bag. So, I think the easiest place to find one
is gonna be the grocery store. Okay, at the supermarket. First, I'm gonna stock up
on snacks. These are amazing. If you ever see these
at a grocery store, get these. And look at this. Perfect. Bonjour... Merci. Oh, it's raining out now.
That's not great. Probably two bags I'm gonna try. If you're wondering how
I packed everything into this, I tightly packed all my clothes, and essentially vacuum-sealed them,
in all these different plastic bags. Alright, going for bag two. It's another thousand coins! Yes...! That was my celebration. Alright, yeah, I guess we should
pull another card now. The train that we don't
want him to take, which goes south...
The first one. Yeah, that leaves in nineteen minutes, and he's still not by the train station. We're hoping that he doesn't
get on that train... ...'cause he is gonna get to Dunkirk. God, I hope he goes to Dunkirk. It'll be so funny if we just
get him immediately there. Just as a reminder,
I'm not going to Dunkirk, because I pulled this Curse
last video. There was only one way
that we could have done it. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed. And... ...Ooh. ""Estimate your city's population.
You may only guess once. ""You cannot use
your phone, the internet, ""or ask anyone any questions
while this challenge is active. If you are off by more than 25 percent,
this card is automatically vetoed."" I think what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna try to... look for the... ...like, the town hall,
the Hôtel de ville of Calais. And hopefully, that'll have some sort of sign
that says the population or something. I don't really know if it would,
but I'm gonna at least try that. And in the process, I'll get more
of a vibe of the city. So, let's give that a shot. In case you're wondering
how unpleasant lugging these around in tote bags and filming is,
in the rain... ...the answer is much! Very conveniently, I found this map. It's, like, the city center of Calais. Not massive. So right now, I'm feeling like,
maybe 40 thousand, 35 thousand. Ben, you got any really great
bits to do on the train? I already did all my bits,
on my own. Mmmmh.
I'm out of bits. I save my bits for the people
who are rooting for Team Ben. #TeamBen.
(wheezes) Do you wanna start a hashtag? Um... I'm gonna do hashtag... #EveryonesAWinner. Nerd. Alright, made it to the big square. Usually, the central square
of a French city is where the Hôtel de ville is,
the town hall is. But I'm not seeing one, unless that's it.
I'm gonna check out that building. Okay. This was not the Hôtel de ville.
I don't know what this is. I think I'm gonna go for a guess.
I just don't— I just can't think of other
useful ways to use my time. (shuddering groan) So, I'm thinking 40,000.
I'm not gonna lock in that answer. I'm just wondering if I should go
a little bit lower. 'Cause it doesn't look like
a city that has grown a lot recently. These buildings look like they are
from the '80s or something. My worry is if
a lot of these are empty. (sigh) Alright. I think I'm gonna lock it in. Yeah. I'm gonna lock it in
at 37,500 people. That is final answer.
Time to look it up. That sucks! Oh man, that would've been
a thousand coins! I'm so... god dammit! Wanna hear something
that sucks even more? So I technically vetoed that card
by failing it, at 12:32. So my 30-minute veto period
ends at 1:02. There's a train at 1:02, that's the train
I wanted to take, to Dunkirk. (sniffle) But I can't take it.
By one minute. And that's the last train
until 12— or 2:29. They're gonna get in at 1:30. Basically... ...I'm a bit screwed. So I'm gonna get as far away
as I can from the train station, to build myself enough—
as much time as possible to do more challenges
until they catch up with me. I just don't see a way of evading that catch
with the current train schedule. So... I'm starting to think
he's not going to Dunkirk. 'Cause that train leaves in 12 minutes,
and he's nowhere near the train station. He's still in Calais,
and it's also— But what's weird is that he doesn't seem
to have another way out of Calais. Alright, I'm back at the water.
I'm gonna walk to that fort, 'cause it's basically as far as
you can get from the train station. Oh, this is interesting. I definitely watched
a Tom Scott video about these. Alright. I have eight minutes
until my veto period ends. Therefore... ...it's that time to figure out
how much I've screwed up by putting Adam in a very good
location for his run. Because his opening move
would be taking a ferry to Dover. So it looks like ferries take
an hour and a half. That would cost him 900 points. He can afford it
with his starting budget. That's not great! I didn't expect to end up
here... in Calais. Let's stop for a second and
look at where he is. Okay. Let's take a look
at where he is. He's, like, by...
the English Channel. Just Uber us exactly
30 minutes to Calais. We'll end up on the edge of Calais,
and then we'll go from there. It says, ""No cars available,""
and that seems bad. We need to hurry. Okay, good news on the
""Adam, ferry to England"" problem. It's 1 PM. The next ferry
after this is 1:50. They're not gonna be able
to make that 1:50 ferry. The next ferry after that
is 3:40. Even with our period of— our no-tagbacks period,
there's the words— I think we can get to that. That almost means that I
kinda wanna get caught earlier. But on the other hand,
I want budget. So that's kinda weird. No rideshare here. I mean, that says
Taxi Dunkerque right there. Okay, okay. He asked if we were gonna
take the ferry to Calais. A lot of people
take the ferry in Calais. Did he say, ""I'm gonna take the ferry""?
There's no way. It would be crazy if he did that. He's gonna take it, isn't he? Alright, 1:02 PM.
We are back in business. Pulling my next card. ""Visit the top attraction."" Okay, this should be easy.
This is not a big town. Well, bigger than I thought,
of course, but... ...let me look that up. The Bur— The Burghers of Calais. The Burghers of Calais. Okay. Oh, that is right by the train station!
Okay, that's risky. That's gonna get me in a
prime location to get caught. And... turns out that my strategy of
getting as far away as possible from it... Not great! So I gotta go
to The Burghers of Calais. Alright, I've put the bags
in sport mode. Goodbye, dragon. We gotta go. We gotta go get
The Burghers of Calais. You don't think he was
just standing by the ferry to mess with us, do you? I wouldn't put it past him.
Yeah. He's moving. He's going... He's going... down... ...back across the bridge.
Maybe he's not taking the ferry. The frickin' toll bridge is up! I need to get to that side
to see the Burghers! This is bad. This bridge is moving
very slowly. I lost, like, five very crucial minutes. I can move. He appears to be potentially headed
back to the train station, but... ...as far as I can tell, there aren't
any trains for about an hour. Zooming in quite a bit, I think
he might be on a bus or something. Alright, see? That's the train station
they're about to pop out of. I'm sure they're looking
at me on the tracker and wondering
what the hell I'm doing! Merci! Okay.
Alright. We ran out of time
on our 30 minutes, so we had to get him
to let us out... ...at this random place.
We took it as far as we could. Oh, cop. Let's just run!
On the bright side, we're still here. Okay. There they are. The Burghers of Calais. Otherwise known as
Les Bourgeois de Calais. Turns out the big fancy building,
that was the Hôtel de ville I was looking for. There are the Burghers of Calais. I don't have time to go
on the right side of it. Now I need to list the
top five things I like about it. I like... the fact that... ...you look these guys up
on the Wikipedia pages, the Wikipedia pages
literally go to a listing about their part of the statue,
not their actual names. The most famous thing they're known for
is being in the statue. Do you know where
we have to turn? No! I also like the fact that apparently, it is to commemorate the
French surrender to the English during the Hundred Years' War,
after they sieged the place. And it's in a French city.
It's a French city... ...commemorating their surrender. It's very windy! I also like the fact that... ...it looks like... Looks like that guy is about
to grab that guy's butt. That's cool. You okay? It sucks!
Buddy, buddy, buddy. You gotta strap your backpack
with your waist strap. The waist strap isn't important.
What are you talking about? The waist strap is the whole point.
The waist strap redistributes the weight, to be on your waist
instead of your back. Alright, I'll put on the waist strap. Actually, I mean,
there's things I like about it. It actually is a pretty impressive statue. From what I remember
from art history, making those clothing things
is really hard on the statue. And they've done it really well. Alright, we're like... ...0.5 miles away now. Almost there! The last thing I love
about this statue: is that it's about to win me
750 coins. Alright, Ben and Adam are gonna
catch up to me any second. I'm gonna pull another card,
because there are some cards that you just claim immediately, and would be huge if
I got one of those. Okay, so there we go.
Top card. ""Visit any museum."" Ugh, 20 minutes there. I can't do that. Okay. I'm just gonna get as far away
from the station as possible. Okay, in the small chance
that they're not about to get off that train and catch me, I'm going to veto that card, so that I don't have to do it, and so that the veto period
starts now. It is 1:28. So in the small chance they don't—
that they're not about to catch me, veto period starts now. 0.3 miles! Almost there,
he's still at that park. Yeah, what's he doing there? You know what?
I changed my mind. I don't wanna go
too far from the station, 'cause I think it's actually
gonna be advantageous for us, when we're trying to catch up to him,
to be close to the station. And it doesn't really change much
by being further. I don't wanna actually delay
the catch too much, 'cause I want it to be possible for us
to get to that 3:40 ferry as Chasers, so that Adam cannot safely get
from here to the UK. I wanna force him back into France.
I don't want him to be safe. What I like about this is
it shows confidence. They're gonna be frazzled at
the fact that I'm just sitting here. So it's been four minutes since
their train should've gotten here, and the station is right there. Kinda feel like they
should be here by now. He should know that we are here, because even if we had
taken that train to Calais, we would've gotten here
right about now. We should put on microphones. We should hide in the parking
and put our microphones on. Okay, so Ben and Adam
put their microphones on wrong and lost audio during the catch,
but it's pretty straightforward. There's them tagging me.
There's me asking if they went to Dunkirk. Here's me laughing because
they totally went to Dunkirk. And back to the show! Art history moment.
This is a famous thing. You ready?
Alright, so you've shuffled the deck. I have shuffled here.
One last shuffle, about to cut. Ready.
Get to it. (slurred exclamation) There he goes. He's jaywalking. He's gonna try to go
to the UK, most likely. It would be good for him to go to the UK.
It'd be good for him to go to the UK. And you cannot get a Eurostar from here. Even though the Eurostars
physically go through here. But you can in Lille. The problem is that he would
not have enough budget to go from here
directly onto the Eurostar. He would have to do
a challenge here. I'm so glad that you thought this out. I'm taking a super-long train
to Paris basically. It's like three hours long. And it's gonna use up all my coins,
but it's... ...like basically my only option! So that is what I'm gonna do. My first choice would've been
to get on the ferry to Dover, but that doesn't leave until 3:40, which means that they
would be able to catch up to me. Which sucks,
'cause that would've been awesome. But before I get on the train,
I'm gonna go ahead and pull my card. Top card. (sigh) Okay.
""Have a fast three-course meal."" Um... Okay, that should be
pretty doable in Paris. Shouldn't be too hard.
That's a good reward. Then I can plan that out on the train.
So I feel fine about that. So it's 2:31. The train would've
left two minutes ago. It looks like maybe he's
not doing that train to Lille. And, I mean, what I expect if not,
he's taking that train towards... Paris. Yeah.
Paris. And then maybe getting off
somewhere in between? I don't know. I'm not sure
that that's... the right move. Can he not get all the way to Paris? He can, it would just take him a really long time,
and I'm not sure where that would get him. 'Cause we could get to Paris
pretty easily, I think. I haven't looked yet,
but I think that's better for us than him going to Lille. So, this whole journey... ...is going to cost a lot. Alright, so that's... ...1730 coins. So that means I only have 270 left. Which is a shame. But it's gonna be fine... I think. So, we think we have the...
the perfect play here. It's such a good move, honestly. Okay, so Adam left on the train to Paris. That train, it goes through Amiens. In a little bit after this,
there's a train to Amiens that tracks the exact same route,
stopping at the exact same stations. And then if he continues onto Paris, we'll get there at 5:11 in Amiens,
and there's a 5:22 train to Paris. So we'll just directly get on another train,
only lose a tiny bit, And we'll get into Paris,
you know, I don't know exactly... About an hour. Yeah.
An hour behind him. Easy. This is such a good move. I am so excited. Let's do it. Love a good move.
Yeah. So, I'm gonna get to Paris
at 5:29. They are gonna get to Paris... ...at 6:30. That's not amazing. (loud sigh) Okay. That's not the best ever. Okay! We have, what, like a minute? Less than a minute. While we wait...
We're not breaking the rules. ...we can...
Oh, it's 2:50. No, forget that. Okay, never mind.
Let's go to the train station! Nous on reviant à Gare de Calais-Ville. I've been practicing
my French, Sam. How was that? Did you know that Sam speaks French? You've been doing it on camera. Only a little bit.
Only when necessary. Okie-dokie. Okay, we are transferring trains
to the train to Paris, because Adam is headed there,
'cause he is crazy. Okay, if anyone tries to come in,
start sneezing uncontrollably, okay? The fastest route to Paris
that they could have taken... ...which they almost certainly
have taken... ...gets here in an hour. Which means... ...I have enough time to go
to the fast food restaurants near this train station
— there are a bunch of them — and do the three-course meal. Then... I'll explain more of my plan... ...later once I'm...
at one of the restaurants. When we get to Paris,
do we want to track him down, or do we wanna try and...?
Yeah. I mean, there are a lot of train stations,
and we cannot let him leave Paris. If we let him leave Paris after
doing a challenge, we're screwed. Welcome to Paris! Okay... so... Gotta go to three
fast food restaurants. First one needs to be an appetizer.
Appetizer can be anything. Oh yeah, there's a Burger King. I'm gonna go with that
for appetizer. Thank you. Oh man. I like this challenge. It's very dumb. But that's what I like about it. That was really fast. Let's keep moving. I'm gonna do... ...Subway maybe? There's a Subway
right around the corner. Subway's fast. And I can get a pretty small sandwich,
I would imagine. So here's kind of a weird thing. Adam is still in front of— (train horn zip) Oh, that was so scary! That was so scary!
Does that happen?! It's a train. Since trains go so fast
near each other— Okay, I'm sorry. Reset. So... We could just go
directly where he is, or we could, like,
go to Gare Montparnasse, and try to defend him from leaving. I don't want him getting on a train
outside of Paris at Gare Montparnasse. Getting a thing with a
bunch of bread was so stupid. I don't know when
I'm gonna learn my lesson! So, as promised. My plan is basically
to take evasive action. So, I looked at
all my options tonight, trying to get somewhere
before the rest period starts at 8. But... There's just nowhere that I can get.
I can't really get much of anywhere, and everywhere I can get
is pretty accessible. So I'm just gonna try to evade them,
while doing challenges, in Paris. I found a weird little train station called Massy-Palaiseau[mah-see pali-sairs] I think, that can get me to Rennes,
which is where I really wanna go. They're gonna think that
I'm gonna be taking Montpar— Mont— Montparnasse[mont pair-a-naws] I think. Gare Montparnasse.[mont par-nas] But I'm not. And I'm hoping
I can fake them out. They're gonna think
I'm gonna take that train. But I'm actually gonna go
down south, the subway, to this weird station,
Massy... Palaiseau.[pali-sairs] Alright, I'm gonna get
ice cream at McDonald's. That should be easy to eat, and fast, and actually delicious. They don't have ice cream. Okay, whatever this is. Let's eat whatever this is. Great. That was super fast. Alright, done. Looks like he's on the move,
because he was down there. Now he's there.
I don't know where he's going. The good news is it doesn't look like
he's going back in the station, which is good, because
I don't want him getting on a train. I want him to be in Paris,
where we can catch him! So I've got just over a half hour
until they get here. I'm gonna pull another card. Alright, here are the cards.
I just take the top one. Is it good? ""Until the next time you get tagged, you cannot use your phone
to research information."" (weak, despondent chuckling) Okay. That's actually okay. Okay. I can do that. I'm just gonna have to figure out
how to navigate the subways. But this is gonna be surprisingly doable! Okay. Okay, good. Okay, I'm gonna pull
another card. So I mean, this is gonna be
our first catch of Adam. And the risk is,
Adam's a good runner, and Adam's also willing to run, willing to make a fool
out of himself in public. He's proved that time and time again. And he's extremely paranoid. And he's extremely paranoid. So I think we really have to be
optimizing for sneaking up on him. Yeah, he's a— I don't wanna get in a
footrace with him. Because while I'm sure
we could eventually catch up, it's gonna take a while,
it's gonna wear us all out, and there's always a risk
that he quickly runs into Métro, and then quickly runs on a train or something,
and just gets completely away from us. And that's too big a risk, so... We gotta do everything possible
to sneak up on him. Even if that means
taking some time to catch him. Main point is, we just cannot
risk him leaving Paris. Okay, next card. ""Use a fancy restroom. ""Use the restroom of a hotel
that costs more than $500 that night. You must actually use the restroom."" (crackly) Okay. It's gonna be really hard... ...to figure out... how expensive...
a room is... at a hotel. I'm gonna have to ask! That is... ...not good! These are the subways.
Where am I? Oh god! They're gonna be here
in 25 minutes. (soft whistle) ""Gare du Nord."" Okay, I'm here. Okay. The Musée d'Orsay is south...
on the blue line. That I know is a fancy place. So what's the blue line?
That's the B line? Okay, I'm gonna take
the B... down. I'm gonna take the B down. Okay! Alright. Let's look for hotels. Hello. How much would
a room be for tonight? Not fancy enough. He said
between one-something and two-fifty. Okay. The Albe Hotel. Let's try that. How much would
a room be for tonight? We're fully booked. Okay. Out of curiosity,
how much would a room cost? Like, it's... ...150.
Okay. It's between this price, 150, 200.
Thank you. 100, 150. Not even close! Okay, I need a truly... like a truly mac-daddy,
nice hotel. Or I might have to veto this card, and I would really prefer
not to do that, 'cause... ...if I veto it... Agh, if I veto it, then I can't
take any transport for half an hour! And that would suck! 'Cause I think they'll come
catch me! But I also don't wanna waste
a bunch of time on this! We're getting to Paris.
He must have messed up. I think he must have made a mistake. Or he, for some reason,
thought this was a good strategy. Again, that's what I'm
really worried of, is us just missing some
crucial element of this, and him just running away
with it. But, we'll see! I'm vetoing the card! I just don't think there's
any way that I'm gonna be able to find a hotel that expensive, let alone...
go to the bathroom in it! Until 7 —
it's 6:30 exactly, until 7 — I cannot use any
forms of transportation. I'm gonna be a sitting duck! Which sucks! But I am allowed to walk around.
I think that if I hide in the subway station, that I might have a chance,
and I actually... I actually brought something
for this exact possibility. So, let's get that going. Yay, beautiful Paris. Okay, that was perfect timing.
Two stops, okay? I brought disguises! Caption+ by JS*

""Tag Across Europe"". We're in Charleville, France,
but that bell means it's 6 AM, and Ben's the runner,
so he's gotta go, go, go! Go-go-go, Ben!
Bye! Go Ben. Go Ben. Go Team Ben. Bye, Ben. Bye, Ben! Okay, we're here in Charleville. Of course,
because no tagbacks, right? So we've gotta stay stationary, or basically stationary,
for 45 minutes. So we've actually got
a good amount of time to plan and strategize and
explain what this is all about, while Ben goes off to... I guess Germany probably, or Netherlands or Belgium
or something. We're in Charleville-Mézières, France, because it's the approximate midpoint
between our three finish-line locations. In this game, Ben's trying to get
here to Borkum, Germany, Adam's trying to get here
to Jersey, UK, and I, Sam, am trying to get here
to Zermatt, Switzerland. While you're the Runner,
you can move towards your location. If you successfully reach your location,
you win immediately. Otherwise, the win
goes to whoever's location is closest to the Runner
at the end of three days, which you can tell
looking at these win areas. But while you're running,
the other two are ""It"", aka ""Chasers"". They'll have a live tracker
on the Runner, and will work together
to tag them. After a tag, positions rotate. The Runner becomes a Chaser,
and the next Chaser becomes the Runner. All of which is why Ben needs to
get out of Charleville-Mézières as soon as possible! Okay, step one: I gotta get out of Charleville. On my way to the train station,
I was looking at all the trains. And we're in a pretty small town.
Charleville's pretty small. So there aren't that many trains
leaving around now at 6 AM. But there is a train to Lille... ...that leaves in about
20 minutes. It's in the right direction. And the key is, it doesn't seem like there's
another train to Lille for a while. Which means that I'll be
pretty safe there... ...hopefully... for a little while. I think he's gonna get on
the 6:25... to Lille. We can't get to Lille for a long time.
Mhm. If he does that... Do we go straight to Brussels? I kinda think we go
straight to Brussels. What—?
(bells chiming) That classic bell to indicate
that it's 6:14 AM. Okay. Okay. I've made it to the train station. The train is here. (softly) So lemme grab a seat. Okay, he's definitely on
the track to Lille. It's just like a really slow train, which is really unfortunate
for Ben, because... ...you have to pay for transit
by the minute, not by distance. Quick explanation time:
when you're the Runner, if you want to take any form of
transportation other than walking, you have to purchase it
from The Shop using coins. One minute of low-speed rail
is 10 coins, one minute of high-speed rail
is 25 coins, and so on. We each start with 2000 coins,
but to earn more coins, the Runner must complete
a randomly-drawn card from the challenge deck. If they complete the challenge,
they'll earn the reward. But if they fail to complete it,
or choose to veto it, they can only walk or run
for the next 30 minutes. Okay, so I've just boarded
my train to Lille. I spent 1500 coins on
150 minutes of low-speed rail. And I started with 2000 coins,
so by the time I get to Lille, as you may have realized,
I'm gonna be close to out of coins. He'll have to spend 1500 coins
just to get to Lille. Which means that if he then
wants to get to Brussels, that's 34 minutes
on high-speed rail, but he'd have to do
a challenge... in Lille. Oh, so we need
to be optimizing for... Well, here's the thing.
We still can't get there very fast. But I wonder if we take
this bus to Hirson, can we then get to Lille...? So, there is a train that
we could get to in Hirson, that goes direct to Lille after. Uh-huh, that's interesting. That's interesting, but that's a risk. It gets in at 9:55.
He'll get into Lille at 8:55. So that's— I don't know—
He'd have an hour. An hour is enough to do
a challenge and get out of there. Okay, it's just about to be 6:45, and even though I'm on a train,
and I'm totally safe... ...I, like... ...my heart is racing! Our 45-minute prison time
ends in like 25 seconds. Ben is definitely going to Lille,
and our plan is we're gonna take a bus to Hirson,
and then a train to Lille. We're gonna get there
an hour after him. But I think that he's gonna be
stuck there doing a challenge, and we'll be able to
catch him right away. I hate when there are
people in our vlogs. It's so awkward!
It's so awkward. Alright, wait, wait. Is it...?
It's not time yet. Okay. We are literally gonna have to
run to this train. It leaves in tw— Oh, there!
Oh, here we go! (bell chiming) See, that's the bell thing!
There you go! That's the first time it was on time!
That's how you know we're legit! Okay, well...
Sam and Adam are off. They are hunting me. It's scary.
It's scary being hunted. I don't know if you can relate. Comment below if you've been
hunted by men, for sport. I'm wearing my...
Danny Ricciardo hat this season... ...to remind myself that
it's alright if you lose constantly. As long as you have fun
while you're doing it, right? Who's Danny Ricciardo? It's fine, you won't get
that reference. The main thing now is
we have to figure out... It's a bus, but it seems to be
run by the train company. Yeah, I don't know how that works. So we need to figure out
where it leaves from. Okay, you think it's that?
Yeah. That's the only bus I see,
and it says SNCF on it. So it must be that bus.
Okay. Hey there.
Bonjour. This bus leaves in seven minutes. I don't think there's a single soul on it.
It's not too busy. Yeah. I know we just started the game,
but my legs literally already hurt. When we— So we all
flew into Paris yesterday, and Sam was like,
""You know what'd be fun? Let's go on a little
scenic walk in Paris."" And we're like,
""Yeah, that'll be fun."" And Sam took us— I'm gonna put up a picture
of what these stairs look like. We walked up this.
He brought us up this. And I'm convinced he did this
to sabotage us. 'Cause... he...
lives near the mountains. He's always mountain biking
and hiking and stuff. And so, he was fine, but I... I am not fine. Alright, where is he? It's updating. That... Is that on the...?
That's not on the train line. That's not on the train line.
I mean, that must be a— That must be an anomaly.
An error. He couldn't have gone there that quickly.
No, no. I mean, that's gonna be an interesting
thing about these trackers, is they are not perfect.
Yeah. Okay, let's do a little Q&A. Let's answer some of your questions. Mayor Video asks: ""I'm probably the only person who finds Ben and Adam
extremely annoying."" I'm sorry, Mayor Video.
That is not a question. I've always wondered
how they make wind. ...What? Okay! Bienvenue à Lille. Merci, au revoir. Merci. So...
So our train isn't til 8:07. Yeah, we have a little bit of time. Do you wanna see if we can get
a croissant or something? Un petit pain au chocolat?
(laughing) Je quoi? I just wanna say that... I'm pretty sure that Ben
doesn't know that we can do this. So I really hope that there's footage
that we can cut to right now, of Ben saying something
along the lines of... I don't think there's a way
for them to get here. But I'm still so nervous. Okay, so here's the deal.
I don't know where I'm going. I've been navigating
with just like... ...cardinal directions
and vibes.  But looking at a map... ...it seems like the next places
I might wanna go... ...would be Brussels or Ghent. And there's a train to Ghent
in about an hour. There's a train to Brussels
in like an hour and a half. But either way, I don't have... ...enough coins for
either of those trains. So that means that
it is time for me... ...to pull a challenge card,
and earn some more coins. So let's do that. Okay, so I've got the deck.
It's all shuffled. So I'm just gonna pull the top card,
and whatever it is... ...that's the challenge I gotta do. I can veto it,
and be stuck here for an extra half hour
before I pull my next card. But hopefully,
I won't have to veto it. Here we go. My card is... ""Eat at the worst restaurant."" Okay, I have to find the
worst-reviewed restaurant within two miles of
where I am right now. And go there and eat something. (chuckling) So let's go do that. Okay, so it was surprisingly
difficult to sort for ""worst restaurant"" on TripAdvisor
for some reason. But the worst-reviewed restaurant that is currently open
within two miles of me is this place,
Le Club Sandwich Cafe, which warns me to
""be careful with the girl."" So... I guess I will go there and
be careful with the girl. This is pretty luxurious, having every method of transport
so far to ourselves. Yeah, it's kinda nuts.
Yeah. It also makes me feel a lot less
bad about... filming. 'Cause I'm not bothering anybody.
Right, yeah. It's great. Love it. It's gonna be a lot worse when
there's a bunch of people around, and then still having to film. E-yup. Fortunately, it's only about
a ten minute walk from here. So I think I'm gonna make
really good time on this challenge, and this is actually
really good, because... ...we did not have time
to eat yet today, and I don't know when else
I was gonna eat. So having an eating challenge, even if it is the worst restaurant,
is pretty exciting. So, I'm doing this all covertly, since Adam's gonna become
my competitor after we tag Ben. But of course, as we're going,
I'm looking and researching about what the best move
is in Lille for me to do. Since I'm next as the Runner. I'm trying to— I think the catch
is gonna happen in Lille. I'm also gonna research a little
about Ben in Brussels. But I always have to keep
an eye towards the next thing, when I'm gonna become the Runner. Okay, so I lost audio during
this entire time that I was in Lille. So I'm just gonna walk
you through what happened. Basically, I went to
Le Club Cafe. I looked at some sandwiches. I picked one of the, like,
two sandwiches that was available. I got that and a
very lukewarm mojito. I ate the sandwich.
It was a bad sandwich. I don't— I don't know
what else to say, besides that I don't know
what was in it. I don't think I can really describe it. It just had a kind of...
an orange... goo inside of it. And it was very hot
and very bad. But I housed the sandwich
fast enough that I was able to make
the earlier route to Ghent, so that's what I decided to do, instead of waiting for
the train to Brussels. And yeah, that's all you
need to know. Just enjoy watching me
suffer through this. And back to the show! So if you'll show that, it looks like he's headed
back to the station. Which could be a problem,
Interesting. 'cause we don't get there
for fifteen minutes. I mean, we don't get there
for twenty minutes. He couldn't get on the train to Brussels,
but he could get on another train. Ben is right in front of the station. That's the station that
we'll be at in ten minutes. I think this is gonna be tight.
It looks like he's going for a train. You think so?
Yeah, the question is, is that train in
the next ten minutes? Can we intercept him once we get there?
Oh man. That is gonna be tight! Yip. Well, let's see. I really hope he's not
about to get on a train. Okay, so I'm getting on
this train to Courtrai.[court-rai] And then I'm transferring there
on a train to Ghent. Now I just have to figure out
where this train is. Oh, he just moved
into the train station. Oh, yeah. So yeah. We gotta be covert
as we get off this train. Let's see. Oh man, he's definitely
about to get on a train. (hisses) Yeah, but is it
in the next nine minutes? Oh man! (wheezes) I've got my ticket. That'll cost me 360 coins, 'cause it's 36 minutes on
low-speed rail. Hoo. I'm gonna get caught,
and it's gonna be right here. I'm just standing around
waiting for this train. And there are huge
crowds of people, so... ...it's gonna be impossible
to see them if they're here. Five minutes away. I'm a little worried
he's going to a platform. Uh-oh. Kinda looks like
he's going to a platform. (softly) Don't go to the platform. Alright, train is here. I'm gonna get at least another stop
without getting caught. Ah man, my heart is pounding. (announcer speaking in French) Alright.
Okay. He's over there.
He's definitely on a platform. Okay. Wait wait, hide hide. He's on the train.
He's on the train. So we need to get
on that train and find him. I believe so. Okay. Alright. That's a good question.
There's two trains. Man, I'd be so bad
to (bleep) that up. It's unclear.
It's unclear? No, there's two. Would he be
going to Tournai or to Courtrai? I'm getting on
this train to Courtrai.[court-rai] Okay, we need to be quick,
because those are gonna leave soon. And if he's not on one, then we need
to be able to check the other. Let me check where Tournai is. Okay, Tournai is in Belgium.
Okay, okay, okay. Then let's go Tournai.
So blue and white, okay. No, that's on track 15.
That's to Courtrai. Tournai is on 11. Oh, is it? This is 13. Where's track 11?
Track 11's here. Okay. That's 11, that's track 11. But he's on this? They are? We need a ticket? Okay then, you have your phone.
Book a ticket, book a ticket. You're sure it's this train? I'm pretty sure. Yep. Where are you going?
To Courtrai. Your ticket, please.
Thank you. Man! How did you get here so fast?! Where's Adam? He's making sure you don't
run off the platform. Okay, well let's get off
the freaking train then. We got him! How you feeling buddy? I really didn't think you guys
could get here. I was like— And I still was like,
I'm gonna get on the fastest freaking train
I can get on. I was like... Awh.
Man! Man! Alright, here.
Come on, come over here. I just don't want that
ticket inspector asking... Yeah! (laughs) ...about why I walked on that train
and immediately departed. (cackles) Yeah, turned out
there was a bus to Hirson! Yeah. Give the cards a shuffle,
so we can hand them off to Sam. I don't wanna give them up. (laughs)
I don't— I want them to be mine. How's your budget feeling? Better or worse
than when you started? It would be pretty amazing
if it was... (muttering indistinctly) That's interesting! (wheezes and cackles) Bastards. The cards.
Merci. And it is... Oh, I'm going?
...10:07. Which means that we can start
chasing you at 10:52. Are you saying my time started? Your time starts now. Bye!
Bye, Sam. Alright, make sure to film yourself!
See you in Zermatt! Oh, Sam Denby started sharing
his location with me. Ooh, how exciting! I'm worried he's gonna be
too good at this game. He sure does know
a whole lot about trains. It would look like Sam
is already on a little train. Wait, what?
He's already on a train? Well, it looks like
he's on a train, doesn't it? What the hell? Where is he going? Might be going west. He's going west?
Why would he go west? West is the one way
he doesn't wanna go. The man... is going northwest. Okay, just to be clear,
northwest is the exact opposite of the way to Zermatt. The man should be going
southeast, but he is going northwest. I just don't— I'm so confused
about where the (bleep) he is. Okay, that worked out perfectly. So I wanna explain
the move I just pulled. Basically, I think Ben messed up.
I think Ben made a bad move. He spent a ton of budget to travel
really far on a low-speed train, to do one challenge and end up
with less budget than when he started. I think the thing to do right now is to grind through challenges,
earn budget, so that we can do a
really robust, high-speed — and that's the key thing,
high-speed — run, which costs more, to our location. Three minutes after I was looking,
turned out there was a train to Calais. Trains to Calais, they seem
to only go every few hours. So after this, there's not another
train to Calais for two hours. And there doesn't seem to be
another means of transportation. So I think I'm gonna have a
two-hour safe window in Calais to just grind through challenges, while Ben and Adam
just wait around. So that's perfect! We think we figured out
what train he's on. It's this. He did this shape. So I think he's on this train
to Calais-Ville. I don't know why though,
'cause that's like... ...the opposite direction. Yeah.
Calais is like... ...all the way northern France. Maybe he just thinks that
we won't be able to get there. It's interesting.
Maybe he's right. Can we get there? There's a train
scheduled at 12:13. It's the same train.
It's not amazing. I mean, that gives him
a two-hour head start. Alright. We are in Calais, the closest
French city to Britain. Only about 30 miles away. Right now... ...I have to commit an
American crime. I've done a bunch
of research on the train, and there's a pretty easy one,
it turns out. In almost all of the US,
including Colorado, where I'm from, it is illegal to drink in public. In most of Europe, including France, it is legal to drink alcohol
in public. Therefore, what I'm gonna do
is drink alcohol in public. Okay, we're out of jail. We're back, we're on the hunt. I'm gonna put on my
hunt glasses. So here's our logic. He's going to Calais. We could get to Calais
by 1:30. And he probably knows that.
And he is gonna figure that out. Which I think means he will take
a train leaving Calais before 1:30. And in terms of— If he's gonna
have time to do a challenge, that actually only leaves
three trains. One to Étaples - Le Touquet, one to Hazebrouck,
and one to Dunkirk. So... let's look at those. Okay, alcohol acquired. Alright, this is my spot. See? Public. Tower. I guess I should
get right to it. Just to be sure, I got the
""Extreme - intense stong beer"". Alright. Drinking in public, completed. Well, if we want to get
to Étaples, that's— we have to get
through Calais anyway. That sucks! Hazebrouck is just back
towards here. Hazebrouck is on the train
that we would be on to get to him. So he wouldn't do that. Alright, it's starting to rain. So while I finish eating, because I now can,
since I completed the first challenge, I'm gonna pull another card.
So I'm supposed to pull the top card. Uh-oh. We didn't mention this earlier,
but this season, we have a new type of card:
Curse Cards! And... I just pulled one. ""The name of your next
town, city, or municipality that you disembark in cannot be
longer than five letters."" Okay. So there's a world
where he goes to Dunkirk, and if he goes to Dunkirk, then we could cut him off
in Dunkirk, potentially. 'Cause we could go straight
to Dunkirk, I'm just saying. But, if he fakes us out... ...and we're stuck in Dunkirk,
that would suck a lot. I mean, it's a big risk, right? Could we get from Dunkirk
[to] somewhere else quickly? No, not really. Bit of a good news,
bad news situation. I haven't talked about this yet. But, my plan was to go
to Dunkirk next. D-U-N-K-I-R-K. That kind of ruins that plan. ""Cannot be longer than five letters.""
So it can be five letters. But Dunkirk is six. Okay, so we've decided
to go to Dunkirk. I am pretty sure
we're gonna get him. Dunkirk makes a lot of sense. It makes so much sense
for him. I think he's gonna do
Dunkirk. Oh man, it's gonna be so sweet
if he goes to Dunkirk! Hello, it's me again.
I'm still eating my lunch, but I just wanna acknowledge,
Dunkirk has seven letters. I just realized that. I know that. Not six. I'm smart. Caption+ by JS*
caption.plus | @caption_plus Well, if you wanna see how much
these guys just messed up, as you probably know by now
if you're a longtime Jet Lag viewer, you can see the next episode,
episode two, right now... ...if you go watch on Nebula. That's of course in appreciation for
the fact that the Nebula subscribers are kinda the ones funding the show. But this season, it makes even more sense
to be a Nebula subscriber, 'cause we're gonna end the season
on a long after-show episode, where we answer
a lot of your questions, dive deep into some of the strategy. But there's way more reason
to subscribe to Nebula, like for example... Like Crime Spree, our pilot season
of Jet Lag: The Game, where we chase Sam
around the country while he tries to break
the country's silliest laws. It was traumatic.
It was rough. This was the season before we
figured out we needed rest periods. Yeah, this is the reason
we have rest periods. But also, what's crazy about Nebula
is the best way to sign up for it is kind of an unbelievable deal
in and of itself. Yeah, it's this bizarre thing
where you can actually get access to CuriosityStream and Nebula, for less money than it takes
to sign up for either of them. CuriosityStream is an incredible
documentary streaming service, that has among other things,
an entire Wendover series called Extremities,
a series that I worked on, that is about why and how the most
remote settlements in the world exist. If you like Jet Lag, and you like travel,
I really think you would enjoy Extremities. We're really proud of Extremities.
We've worked really hard on it. And we think it's really good. This series literally could not
exist financially without all of you Nebula +
CuriosityStream bundle subscribers. It's only $15 — actually it's slightly less
than $15 — for the entire year. It's a crazy good deal!
It's a crazy good deal. And yet, you all really do help
fund this channel. We know exactly-- This channel could not exist financially,
it would not be profitable without you all. So it's really worth signing up,
'cause you also get all that other stuff. One week early access to episodes, exclusive behind-the-scenes,
after-show stuff. All sorts of other stuff from us,
all sorts of stuff from other creators. It's a crazy good deal,
so click the button on-screen, or head over to curiositystream.com/jetlag
today to sign up and... (sneeze) ...thanks in advance for your support!
Thanks for watching! (cackling) You almost got it.
I think we gotta use that. Let's keep that.
We gotta use that take!"

The production has offset 10x its estimated carbon impact through a cookstove replacement program in China certified by the Gold Standard: https://registry.goldstandard.org/credit-blocks/details/279220","uXmnxhYQ_Iw","we're 52 hours into our race around the world if you want to know what happened in those 52 hours we made a whole bunch of videos about it so go watch those right now both teams are in Singapore me and Joseph only have 20 and in order to beat Ben and Adam we need to get on a super extensive flight directly to the US by the end of tonight in order to make that money our plan is to do the get drunk on a local liquor Challenge and gamble that reward money at a casino until we have enough to buy the plane tickets Ben and Adam have to take the long route back to America through Australia because they have a lot of distance make up to meet the distance requirements they were about to board an overnight flight to Sydney but well you'll see what happened with that a very good evening ladies and gentlemen just to put you in the picture of what's happening with the aircraft at obviously you can see what's possibly what's happening out there the aircraft was struck by lightning when it came into Singapore there is superficial damage to the aircraft unfortunately they've done the inspections but they have got quite considerable inspections to do a lot of the event very long days and there's still a long night ahead of us that is not good it was struck by lightning that's exciting content though lightning we got lightning on this show oh my God pretty cool huh you have a new Lounge up there's this freaking Avenue Lounge it said up saying we're running another time that casino sign said did sign said up where is it said this way oh my god do you think Starbucks has a liquor is anywhere down there have alcohol it doesn't look like there's any help now it just looks like normal food court yeah I don't understand it do you think the Ferrari store has alcohol do you think they allow public drinking here can we just go to a liquor store in the bottle we're not risking Singapore yeah there's police everywhere in here it literally pops all over the place in here I don't really fancy getting arrested okay so this delay is kind of a big problem for us we are open and we can take a 10 15 direct flight from Sydney to LAX we already have a flight Fiji book that's later but yeah if we can get direct to La we save like seven hours I think five hours yeah do you just have a bar or yes or a burger could be committed okay no worries 4L l City where they they said they were sold out right they said they are fully commanded they're fully booked what about this Mach 32 place I guess we could try yeah we go to the bar um okay that's fine no worries so uh departure at the moment they are publishing as 2200 hours which is at 10 pm when they say um departure's at 10 now oh dear that's not good I want you are you sitting at the bar yeah do you have any uh do you have any liquor made in Singapore local liquor nope another Singapore liquor at all they do have brewed but it tastes like if you haven't heard of island island brand oh yeah yeah we don't have it here no no no no no they don't have any local liquor there's no local Singaporean well apparently there's one but it tastes like yeah they've just got the new information from the engineers you need more time to do the checks on the aircraft provisional departure time from here is now at 11 o'clock local timing did you hear that another delay another hour we're really gonna have to start thinking about backup option that this one falls through but the flight to um Darwin 10 45. there's an 11 P.M to Adelaide there's a 2 A.M Singapore to Sydney oh you know what I would argue that I started having fun when did you start having fun I've been having fun honestly since pretty much all day today well I think officially I started having fun when we started looking for alcohol I really I really enjoy looking for alcohol so I think we started having fun at 5 30. it was only 20 minutes ago yeah yeah but like we had an actively have fun okay that's true we're gonna have some alcohol that's funny yeah which is fun and not a challenge yeah and then gamble whatever's left so we can get 300 something having a good time yeah all right and then Camp YOLO all that yeah we either go big or go home except in this case not go home yeah in this case we're stranded yeah go big or stay here and go big or stay stay tracked ladies and gentlemen thank you for waiting we finally have the good news we are going to start voting now at this stage we'd like to invite our priority customers in group one two and three to proceed in for morning so now I think we are gonna at least have enough time to make that that flight to Fiji yeah we should foreign [Music] just a wild guess but at this point of the game Sam and Joseph should be headed either to Australia or to Tokyo so maybe Soul maybe soul relax machine up to 25 bucks so what do you think 17 each time yeah so just five dollars each time on the last 17. yeah I think so okay so they have a real roulette thing up there oh and so we're all watching [Music] let's go [Music] oh my God oh my God we just got it oh my God you see that no way I told you this is a Flawless strategy Flawless strategy everything on it I should have what do we have now so wait so we have where's our money it should be five times thirty two it says we only have 50. we started with 50. yeah and I don't what is there a minimum that we're not meeting oh Min bet 25. oh no that is devastating we wouldn't want 800 I know we wouldn't know if we had non-stop elves if we put the minimum 25 on black there we would have won 800 non-stop Bells I can't that was almost enough all right we gotta try to double our money on black now foreign [Music] there's no way we don't take another hour right now first time we got the number back right it literally was that didn't even tell us okay so now we have 75 so we're getting another 25 on black 25 up all right come on let's get another black nope well we're just backwards well we have uh 25 left should we put it on black again yeah okay we got 25. what do you think black again or should we just go into the numbers let's keep doing black but we could put on 17 twice or 25 on 17. okay that is not 17. that's the black 33. I think we should do something again go big or go home we're not gonna make any progress all right we go bigger we get stranded well we are officially broke but we're having a good size too foreign test [Music] I'm leaning fish at the moment if you can find a place to rent one if there's a National rent a fish to rent like that you know I wish we but if we I mean if no fish are biting which might just happen yeah we'd be in trouble we might not be able to make it onto our flight to Phoenix all right so it's officially been two hours yeah I mean we've had a good time and earned 300 for that here's the deal we need almost exactly 2625 Singaporean dollars to book that flight to JFK and we have 400. we have 400 so we need about 75 each time in the numbers and if we get it one time we have the money to do it I'll be on the math do you think that's what we do we just I think we just needed about 7 75 on 17 each time all right [Music] I don't see how this could ever go wrong right no not at all I mean what else has gone wrong today nothing yeah of course all right we'll get them next time right it was a good practice reaction over this time right that is not 17. it's all black though time we'll get him this time right yeah I'll hit him this time it's fine we'll get in this time right I mean we'll get them this time we got to this is the last one all we gotta do I mean we're going to win it this time yes of course that's what's in the script right yeah you're not supposed to say that Tim why do you spoil it yeah I like that skin that was a good spin it was robust that is not 17. it's fine we have 25 bucks left we put 25 on 17. we've been on 17 and then we put everything else on 17 and get back up to 2600 right yeah let's do it perfect strategy we'll get them this time [Music] well Joseph I'm sorry to say it but I think we might have just lost jet lag the game I think we can finally admit that we have probably lost So Adam and Ben wherever you are um We're not gonna tell you we're not gonna tell them that we've lost We're not gonna say but wherever you're at we just have no way of leaving Singapore yeah we're stuck without just ending up stuck in Seoul airport which they wouldn't let us do because you can't we don't have an exit floor yeah we can't fly there unless we have a flight Beyond which we can I think I think we've been checkmated no way one more round if we had had like if we had oh my God literally the next one was 17 guys with that loss Joseph and I are trapped in Singapore for the rest of the game there's no way through grinding challenges or gambling for us to make the money before the last flight of the night we are well and truly screwed but Ben and Adam aren't out of the woods yet with limited challenges left 370 dollars in the bank and only 37 hours left to get the remaining 8 325 miles back to Denver they're going to need everything to go right from here on out to get back before the clock hits 100 hours [Music] thank you okay so we just got in it's about nine a.m our flight got in late we have to get on a flight at about 1 15 and before that we need to earn 800 800 so we've decided that we are going to catch a fish uh so step one of that means we have to go buy a fishing rod we have to apply for our fishing license yeah we're getting a fishing license okay we are now licensed to fish in Australia so that's good no uh challenges from Sam Joseph I haven't heard from them in a while probably on a long flight presumably cut to them on a flight well I mean Singapore I love you but I hate you yeah I kind of I kind of hate student Port right now honestly we came here and we've just had L after l i mean all we could do is have fun we couldn't even find liquor maybe we find liquor we got the Michelin Star Rob from us we got the bungee jumper up from us congrats to Ben and Adam hopefully their plane just gets like diverted to Midway Island or something and they get stuck there for days and and then we can I don't know what we would do then I mean we still don't have we still have no way to earn we are totally hacked we're done so I think we're done so we've done so we're gonna find some food we haven't eaten since like breakfast and just I don't know drink what just drown our sorrows out so yeah congrats bending how to thank you goodbye [Music] welcome thank you thank you we're looking for like the cheapest cheapest fishing rod you have but at least still work really good one uh uh do you want to start our package stickers that'd be great yeah we're from from yeah from New York New York oh I spent my honeymoon oh incredible let's try this more pack of prawn I mean 91.35 perfect thank you have a good one all right that was pretty efficient [Music] wonderful thank you so much all right buddy let's catch a fish [Music] okay and with a lot of confidence turns out that confidence from this place [Music] [Music] excuse me have you bought any fish today [Music] I did not know that fishing could be this stressful it happens again [Music] I think it's all about the end all right we can do this [Music] any luck they're like little minnows down there right I think so [Music] are you getting this I mean this is beautiful here yep oh man we made a huge mistake and just massive I just imagined the ocean around Australia full of beautiful exotic fish yeah I sure did that we could snatch out of the water at a moment's notice but there are none not a one there's like two actual Fisher guys who have been there for hours and they haven't caught them so how would we test that normally the answer is keeping up I could try and jump into the water over there where the minnows are and just thrash around like it's not the worst up here no it's not are those minnows yeah those are [Music] I think we need to dive in okay I'll do it sure you don't want me to do it I'll do it hopefully I'll just go into my underwear yeah wait then [Music] oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God [Music] look that's a fish we have caught the tiniest fish in the whole world [Music] oh my god oh I was about to jump into the water you know here is this one think of the content that you're missing out on you gotta go backwards too I'm gonna go put my shoes on we did it I cannot believe it [Music] [ __ ] our onward flights to La thank you thank you [Music] foreign [Music] one thing we fail to consider is that this is the southern hemisphere which means that it's winter now which means that at 7 pm it's pitch black out uh attempting to jump into the ocean for a shell with kill us be back um do you know that they actually like bottled this stuff in Fiji and then ship it other places isn't that crazy yeah I mean isn't that exactly what it says that they do like did you think that I don't know did you think that Fiji Water didn't come from Fiji I just thought it was like a brand like it was the vibe of the water was Fiji it was sort of Fiji vibe why would they ship it from here it's the same thing just the whole point of the water is that it's water from Fiji that's why it's called the beachy water it literally says from the islands of Fijian that's not that doesn't appeal to me at all all right back to America we're realizing it's been what like 28 hours since Sam and Joseph have completed a challenge yeah I mean they're either like in jail or they're about to win yeah it's definitely one of the two let's hope they're in jail [Music] there are signs pointing three different ways for taxi this one says go that way this one says go that way that one says go this way build a Subway idiots there's a 4 30 flight to Denver that we really really really want to make because if we don't make it then we have to wait another two and a half hours until then too late which is also much more expensive so we only need like 80 more dollars to buy this flight so we're doing the cheapest challenge that's left which is get drunk on a local liquor now that we're back in the United States that liquor is going to be Bourbon and we are heading to the Santa Monica Pier as fast as we possibly can to get drunk let's go [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] here we go again when we're doing this two Series in a row I hope you didn't find it it's Tradition now for us to do this last one all right okay get it down before you go a big game [Music] uh yeah three and a baby that's 300 that's enough to make our flight to Denver time to go thank you all right Santa Monica Pier yeah oh actually our car's gonna be here for four minutes so here I'm just gonna Sprint here okay I'm gonna show everyone Santa Monica Pierre [Music] buildings now we gotta go we got a book the tickets before we're too drunk all right let's book those tickets that's flight books last free books yeah [Music] how you feeling [Music] my body has nothing but Bourbon and peanut butter cracker are you drunk um I'm I'm pretty much fine right now it takes a little while for shots to kick in for me okay and we're still playing the game these are the challenge in over 24 hours so gameplay might be in jail or something I don't know [Music] if what would happen if he died all right ah let's absolutely do it buddy this way all right hey buddy food's almost ready got you I got you a drink here I didn't know what you wanted I got you a Diet Coke I love the coke that's what I thought you'd like all right how you feeling Adam the world is a beautiful place and I'm glad we went around it together me too buddy [Music] all right here we go it's gonna happen

joseph from real life lore are on a flight to singapore with our ticket to seoul already booked the problem is we only have 20 and we need to make enough money to take a super expensive flight from seoul to the us before we can get on our flight to seoul our plan once we land is to earn 1200 bucks by bungee jumping in singapore during the few hours we'll have before the game's mandatory rest period begins unfortunately for us ben and adam had the same idea [Music] all right hands up to the side right now are you good here we go buddy this is it look forward in point all right everybody five four three two five four three two one oh [Music] that woke me up in case anyone was wondering bungee jumping is way scarier than it looks being scary i thought i thought it was gonna be very scary and it was five times scarier than i expected money in the bank oh my god that is the most deserved twelve hundred dollars we've ever gotten yeah oh [Music] okay we've made it to singapore yep we're back which is the good news the bad news is you saw the text right yeah okay so the bad news is that adam and ben completed the bungee chummy challenge and that was kind of our whole ploy so i don't know what else can we do before the rest period i don't know i mean i i looked and like everything like the two other big ones universal and people yeah there's no way we could do that they both require reservations they stopped doing challenges around like 11 or 12 a.m central european time there was a 1 pm flight to singapore from milan where we think they were so you think there's maybe a good possibility that they're here with us or will be here with us for the rest of the year there's also very few cities where you can bungee jump yeah like that easily so you think they may have done literally what we were going to do i think there's a very real chance they're here which means like the challenges that are easy for us are going to be easy for them we could definitely earn some more money hey those people are kayaking oh oh i think we're kayaking we're going to see if we can figure out where that person got that kayak [Music] all right here we go let's do it [Music] so we have to go one mile easy yeah honestly not having that bungee jump one that makes me pretty nervous uh that makes me really nervous about being able to get out of here we're definitely gonna be able to get to soul stones we have the flights to seoul but then we need something else i know getting out of seoul is the the hard part we're starting to think is like what we learned in amsterdam is planning really counts here yeah not allowed to plan or research or anything during our rest period yeah so maybe the best use of the next two hours rather than scrambling and failing he's like meticulously planning what we do after the rest period okay i i agree all right well totally i guess uh i guess we're gonna uh head to our hotel and do some plotting do some plotting and some rest yes finally i got almost 48 hours of being on the move continuously you know you're sitting at a computer and you're writing challenges and you're like it can't be that hard to kayak a mile but then you're in the kayak in singapore it turns out it's harder than you thought it would be i remember this exact conversation i remember we said how how far should it be a mile yeah sure all right and then we never talked about it again [Music] that sure is a lot of water falling big fountains getting a taxi slash uber is taking forever so it makes me think we made the right call in terms of not rushing to try to do something it feels like we should like sing a song like a sailing song yeah do you know any sailing songs i don't know do we know any sailings uh what's like what's like row row row your boat gently down the stream i don't remember this i can have that song row row row your boat gently down the stream merrily merrily merrily's got the maryland i don't know the words yet there are there's two there's two lines in the song is there not more to the song no [Music] all right that is a mile on water under human power that is uh what 350 for us in the bank let's go all right we made it to our hotel yeah this is the last you'll hear from us for 20 hours we're exhausted we're going to be very excited to go do nothing for 20 hours hell yeah how you doing buddy so sleepy [Music] okay we just arrived at the hotel the great period is starting i've never been more excited to take a shower my entire life it's uh it's truly the most wonderful time of the year okay so for the next 20 hours the game is paused that means no forward progress no challenges and no strategy talk all we're supposed to do is get a relaxing night of sleep in an actual bed it's about 4am and i've just awoken from a nightmare where sam and joseph beat us in the race before we could even get to australia so hopefully that won't happen in real life it is 4 a.m i've been trying to get back to sleep for like an hour or two now failed completely so i decided to wander the streets towards a 24-hour coffee shop and explore singapore at it coolest it is ever in the day it is 84 degrees out it's humid it is hot and it's 4am this is unbelievable i don't know how people live here and i especially don't know how we're gonna run through the streets completing challenges tomorrow this view really tells you what singapore's economy is all about see uh bank bank bank bank bank bank bank bank bank not bank bank and then a fancy hotel all right we're having some uh dim sum for breakfast happy breakfast adam morning good morning it's a mixture of uh pastries and i guess pastries what round of food is this joseph it's only number two so it's still the rest period but the hotel kicked us out at one the game restarts at 3. just walking around to seeing the sights we're at the big the the only thing that i knew about singapore before coming here is the thing we're going to go see you have anything funny to say ben [Music] no i just think those are really cool anything funny to say about this no but i have a fun singapore fact okay you know that it's illegal to eat a durian fruit on the subway here it's not relevant to this i just thought of it i thought that was interesting perfect content ben yeah it is two minutes to three we're almost back at it now comes the stage in the game where for some stupid reason i actually feel genuinely like physically nervous to complete a completely arbitrary game that we just made up the rules for i also feel really nervous i am i don't know why which is stupid yeah why would we feel nervous i feel so much anxiety in my stomach just about making it uh making it back and making it back on time is super nerve-wracking yeah well the thing is beeping that's great that indicates that it's the game is back on the first thing we need to do is book our flight to australia then we also need to book our onward flight from australia so we're booking a flight to fiji because it's not that expensive we also have a ton of like administrative stuff we have to do we have to get our australia e-visas approved we have to get travel insurance for fiji um and then once we get to australia we have to have coveted tests ready to take before we leave here we have what like four hours until the flight we're planning on taking to australia yeah so we are going to do another challenge we are going to eat at a michelin-starred restaurant it's a very pleasant challenge um doesn't get us a lot of money it does we want to do it and so we're going to do it oh oh it's three oh it's three years forget my response okay i think we need to consider what ben and adam are doing i'm now even more confident that ben and adam are here in singapore because i looked at the time that they sent the message yeah saying that they completed bungee jumping yeah it was 1 30 p.m singapore time which seems strange because the flight that we thought they were on arrived from milan at like 7 or 8 a.m but the bungee jumping place here the only bungee jumping place in singapore opens at 12 30 p.m i'm super sure they're here which means they're very far along and unfortunately i did the back with the napkin math and i believe that they have around 2 000 in the bank right now that's so much more than us that is because we're broke we have like 25 bucks or something so we either have to find one that we can get a reservation at or we have to find a place that's more casual oh look there's one that says street street food what's that one it is open okay that's good okay it's like two miles away we're going to hill street taiwan pork noodle which has one we gotta go stop explaining things we're going yeah so how screwed are we right now a little bit so i think we need to be looking for the hail mary option let me explain why we're in such a pickle right now we've basically got three options one we take our already book flight to seoul problem is it gets us out of singapore quite late and after looking closely the connections to the us are at bad times and have gotten even more expensive i'm pretty sure if we do this we'll lose two we go somewhere nearby that's not sold the two with flights to the us are tokyo and sydney trouble is by the time we'd earned the money to get an expensive flight to sydney it would be late and we'd definitely be behind and tokyo is only open for transit so we couldn't leave the airport to do challenges either way i'm pretty sure we lose which leaves option three go big risk everything to get an extremely expensive direct flight from singapore to san francisco it would mean we'd almost definitely win but the only way to afford that flight is well you'll see i believe the hail mary option is to make some money bring it to the casino and gamble it did a bunch of research but unfortunately i learned more about the challenges we cannot do than the challenges we can do well to start with we can't do the rollercoaster wine universal studios singapore but it's sold out paintball um there's only like one or two places and they both require super advanced booking so uh there's the eat a meal to michelin star restaurant singapore is famous for having like hawker stands like street street stalls that are michelin star and just by chance when joseph and i were on a walk earlier we stumbled across a pond of fish yeah like tons of tiny fish that we could very easily catch there's that challenge to catch a fish and i'm sure they actually know it specifically says that we can catch it by hand yeah we can okay this is the bus we need to get on so that stop is down there so we're going to race it down this street okay so let's find a michelin star hawker stand head there and then if that goes super quick i think we could still have time to go catch the fish if we can get just enough if we can win just enough to get that flight yeah so we should calculate our bets to get exactly what we need if we win but if we win it's so epic that's the whole i know that's the most incredible story and ben and adam will be so pissed all right you might notice that this is not in fact a michelin star restaurant and that's because on the right we noticed that we messed up a bit the catch of fish challenge is actually worth 800 which was a lot more than we thought it was right initially and we think we can do that super quickly so we got to do that first i figured that we can turn this into a net just by poking a few holes in there just tiny tiny tiny little bit of pressure it's a big one i know all right that is kind of big unfortunately here first of all we need to not get caught because i know this what if we went on the far side this seems highly illegal okay there's no security cameras around right oh except for that one right there all right as we've been walking i have booked our flight to australia we're gonna explain why we're going to australia once we get our food this is not that bad of a line at all about to just get destroyed by this thunderstorm [Music] i feel like they can swim here but the turtles are coming oh no that's not my foot my foot is much harder than we thought you're too smart i like the pigeons i hate when the challenges are challenging they they say there's plenty of fish in the scene well this is a uh there's not a c sam okay here's what we'll do all stand in that one spot with the bag sitting very still you grab some small rocks to scare the fish okay [Music] that's my feeling [Music] oh someone's coming okay so we just found out that place is cash only so i am running to the nearest atm to try and get cash in time we wandered off for a second and that family picked up our bag yeah they came back and picked her bag up they must have thought it was in there yeah was like props to them so now we don't now we're backless because i think that guy's just throwing the bag away yeah i think you're almost an hour yeah and that family is still there we should probably just go and try and do the michelin star restaurant in the qrikets worry about the mission star taking one yeah but i mean what other choices do we have at this point [Music] hello to the audience we got two dishes um give me your glasses i can make what they're called all right one of the ghost tank that's this one and this one is a like a gan mine so one thing that's interesting is this is one of only two restaurants in the entire world that has a michelin star and sells like street food and the other one is in hong kong and this is very good i'm very lucky so while we eat let's explain why we're going to australia yeah so you might be wondering why are we going to japan why aren't we going to seoul if we went for japan or seoul we would not meet the distance we'd have to go through australia to reach the distance that the traffic of cancer distance that we need to reach in order to officially circumnavigate all right we have finished our michelin star meal and our car is nearly here take us to the airport it is also starting to rain and it's just thank you very much okay it's somewhere in here okay i think we've got to look for the big one just got word i just ate in a michelin starcraft so we were literally just literally in line are they here you think i don't know i mean this is like the classic michelin walker stall let's see if we can find him [Music] all right you're really limping there buddy boy my feet are messed up i don't see them but that is so frustrating we literally just keep hitting l i know we were like three spaces away from getting the mission server and if we went here first instead of trying to catch the damn fish i bet they didn't even need it i bet they just like had some dinner i cannot believe how many else we're getting oh i feel like we should just do something super easy like get drunk and then just like yolo our money we can you know make the money with your tradition so i think honestly the best bet is just to get drunk on local liquor have a good time at the casino and if we lose at least we're drunk for drunk and then just yolo it all in the casino have a good time while we're doing it for two hours in the casino i think that works okay should we get a if we get a car to the um to the casino in the marina bay sands there's gotta be a bar in the raid base yeah after a lot of bureaucratic red tape we got our tickets and we are headed to australia for some reason our gate always has to be the one that is like the furthest possible away that's where they keep the good ones that's where they keep the good ones like sydney i want to walk fast we have maybe 30 minutes left to have any chance of catching that flight tonight and and i have like a completely empty stomach and i think you said you did too i haven't eaten anything since for breakfast this is not going to be very coherent okay so we're going to be blasted drunk and then go to the casino with only 300. and we have to win 2 grand what could possibly go wrong nothing a regular evening ladies and gentlemen just to put you in the picture of what's happening with the aircraft obviously you can see what's possibly what's happening out there the engineers are looking at the aircraft at the moment the aircraft was struck by lightning when it came into singapore some of you were on the aircraft and probably experienced that down the left-hand side there is superficial damage to the aircraft unfortunately they've done the inspections but they have got quite considerable inspections to do a lot of you've had very long days and it's still a long night ahead of us [Music] that is not good but you know what is good the fact that i've already planned out your entire night of entertainment of course you're gonna start by watching the season finale of jet lag it all comes to an end and you can watch that episode right now if you're a nebula subscriber that's of course to thank the fact that our nebu subscribers are quite literally the ones funding the show at 100 this show would not be financially possible without them but what i'd recommend watching after that is modern conflicts it's another series on nebula by joseph real life floor my teammates this series is about uh it's kind of profiling with these mini docks all sorts of modern conflicts all sorts of conflicts that have happened in recent decades so i'd really recommend watching that but the good news is that if you're not already a subscriber it's pretty easy to sign up and get access to every single episode of jet lag one week early the best way to get access to nebula is not actually by signing up directly it's through the bundle deal that they have with curiosity stream that's because it's actually cheaper than signing up directly if you go to curiositystreams.com jet lag our link at that link curiosity stream is on sale for just 14.79 a year and also if you sign up for that link they just throw the nebula subscription for the entire coming year for free it's included and of course what that also means is you get access to all of curiosity stream which is a whole nother streaming site with great

right now me and my partner joseph from real life lore are stuck in amsterdam we have a plan to take a flight to singapore in eight hours but first we need to earn a ton of money by doing challenges from this list the other team adam and ben are in busto arcizio italy and just earned enough money to take a flight to singapore the only trouble is that flight starts boarding in an hour i mean if if we book it and we can't get on it if there's some rule there's anything okay we're out of money okay we've done two challenges here okay okay we'll book it at the airport [Music] let's do it buddy all right we gotta find the singapore air gate whatever thing asap because i don't know when they're gonna stop booking this flight please please please please can i buy two tickets to the 150 non-stop to singapore the flight uh the flight is uh you have to go to the tickets encounter this is not a ticket oh where's the ticket encounter it's been a bad idea eight hours or nine hundred dollars i think that's doable if we can't get that budget now to get the onward flight to seoul we could book a flight that we couldn't take as a backup depaul i'm poor for nothing we go touch up there's a bird right there [Music] don't scare the bird here birdie birdie nope nope we need to have like some clothes i've got free snacks oh no look fruit snack get the first snack i think we have to study bird behavior where are these birds landing and then we gotta like get to where they're landing before they land just want to say hi you have bread well like pretzels this is this is a slow game bird yes yes look there's a better one here it's a better one there oh can we buy two tickets on the 150 singapore air flight direct to singapore i'm so unbelievably sweaty thank god okay we're through security we're about to order flight to singapore i don't know where sam and joseph are but they are hosts yeah they're they're in trouble the boys are in trouble not these boys not these no no not these boys uh these boys are about to be in singapore 12 hours before the rest period starts i'd be pretty shocked if the other boys had pulled that off no bird god damn it bird wasn't this difficult i almost got it getting all outsmarted by bird this bird's fast look at that look at that speed come on my guy should i go for it oh me these damn stuck-up aristocratic birds is there like a place in amsterdam we can go that just has like a bird we can touch like a pet store you know i feel like we should just take the running at bird strategy just like went right up to these people [Music] got it i got it did you get it i got it [Music] this took like 40 minutes jesus christ okay let's let's do something else fine thank you [Music] it could have been us oh we do get extra leg room we got a gaming we have a weird little gaming console the estimated flight time is zero minutes so we're gonna get in extra early [Music] all right well i've touched a burn hence the hand sanitizer and for all of that we only earned 75 bucks it's longer than expected um so we're a seven minute walk to a casino because it would be a one quarter one we would get a seven uh sorry a 50 gambling budget but i guess we should just do that while we're here [Music] i really did not expect to be spending all day in amsterdam yeah neither did i here we go holland casino i'll see you five minute long it's really nice being in walkable cities we should maybe think about that for other countries all right let's go in casinos don't really like filming so our gaming footage kind of sucks but i'm just gonna tell you what happened we played roulette and we just kept betting on 17 black and odd and we kept winning you don't have to know what that means you'll just get it from reactions money big money big our okay oh nice [Music] oh my god oh my god look at that okay well uh we just won almost four hundred dollars our luck just changed very fast i was feeling i was feeling like so unlucky i mean it wasn't even unlucky it was just like we did a bad job yeah for man all right let's do the math and see if we have enough to book our flight yeah so i think we might now which i was not expecting to have this quickly one six one four we have enough all right let's book it should we book the flight singapore yeah let's do it man this was easy yeah i think we can gamble the rest of our budget are we allowed to no the rules didn't explicitly say we couldn't okay so i'm booking this flight but then it's it's not like we can just do nothing for the rest of the day because ideally we want to book that flight right after our rest period ends to seoul which i believe was like 670 bucks so that's that's a good amount of challenges of the kind of one-quarter value that we uh have right now so we're still gonna have to grind for the rest of the day to try to book that one so just to recap most countries especially countries like singapore won't let you in unless you've booked proof of armor travel so before we leave for singapore we need to spend the day in amsterdam earning enough money to get this flight from singapore to seoul then we want to take this super expensive flight from seoul to lax the good news is we have a plan we'll land in singapore with just enough time to earn twelve hundred dollars by bungee jumping at a place called sky park sentosa if we can pull all this off we're pretty sure we'll win the game yes our first order of attention is we're gonna go to mcdonald's because uh first of all food second of all we can get 50 bucks out of the original 200 by eating a menu item that is not available in the united states and there is one here which we will show you shortly [Music] all right so we're very comes from the fact that sam and joseph of gravley been doing a lot of stuff while we've been in the air and we need some way you know we need some content that we can cut back to us more to kind of break that up and remind you that there are two teams in the show so ben do something [Music] well the chili chicken yeah that's that's unique i think welcome to our special dutch mcdonald's muffin special menu item number one chocolate milk full menu item number two that we're pretty certain on is the veggie patty honey crispy chicken but not actually chicken honey say much yeah it looks like this special menu item number three freak sauce crazy which i think looks delicious yeah that's definitely i've never seen fruit sauce before i don't know if i like that color no hair down some chocolate milk oh yeah and i'll have some fruit sauce and then we'll have completed yum all right [Music] all right and some fruit sauce actually it's quite good i like it it's pretty good yeah it's basically just like yoo-hoo but so nobody can argue that that's that you can get the choco milk in the u.s you're the time lapse of us eating you gotta eat handsomely the lunch on singapore air is actually very nice pretty good not so bad they gave us ice cream sean jinxer that was prozac by the way say medicated kids although don't don't do this this was a terrible idea oh my god about a fountain [Music] okay said a fountain yeah and then what do you refer to this as i refer to this as a water like a drink you found it yeah so they didn't specify this type of fountain even though this might be what we're thinking about right so i think under the rules a drinking fountain like this would be a legend great a distraction distractions well we know there's another fountain right over there which is not an eyesight you're wasting valuable water that is a full cup guys it was a full cup i don't think i should be the one carrying this because i have like very fidgety hands fine well then you have to film well that's also bad for filming but all right transfer too all right that's right and adam are gonna probably complain about this and like put stuff up in the edit because they're gonna be sore losers when they end up losing the end adam what have you learned about yourself during this flight i've learned that i really don't want to watch the show ozark i downloaded the whole first season i ran out of other things and instead of watching it i just went to sleep it was back this way all right uh we gotta cross here [Music] you're welcome fountain [Music] think joseph about what canada goose it's very expensive isn't it yeah what do they have right there i don't know some hats should we check out canada i catch what you're laying down check out what kind of hats canada yeah let's let's go check it out yeah okay you want this one this one's 150 euros which would be in budget [Music] all right that was an easy 100 100 bucks what was that how much do we spend like 170 we spent 150 bucks well euros so like 160 us dollar to make a hundred dollars to make 100 of course like the what we spend does not come out of our budget efficiency it comes out of the production budget yeah and it comes out of my bank account your problems though it is worth considering like this will make our lives more difficult in singapore in terms of like doing the challenges we need to get the budget going we're not going to have very many challenges left by the time we get to singapore but on the other hand it's gonna make their lives difficult even earlier yes they're gonna get off their flight and they're all of a sudden gonna have like two-thirds of the i'm probably gonna get a nasty text message from adam saying you're breaking the game sam and yes i may be breaking the game but strategically so strategically breaking [Music] here's a here's a fun little illustration in the security card the plane's about to crash and all the people are ducking but there's one baby just sitting normally no idea something's going wrong i don't think there's much topography to reach to ascend 500 feet it doesn't actually say that you have to do 500 feet like all at once like climb a 500 foot mountain it just sends you need to ascend 500 feet to a high point without touching pavement but like if we just found like a 10 foot mound and did it 50 times just ran up and down it 50 times yeah i mean there is that big mound that was backed by um oh yeah by uh the rice the rice museum should we do that yeah [Music] all right measuring up says 18 feet 10 inches so we need to do 28 climbs yep [Music] thirty [Music] [Music] yes [Music] what was that 150 bucks yeah 150 bucks wow easy easy [Music] the food is coming i'm so hungry if they didn't feed us on these flights we would have been dead by now the only food i've eaten has been four doughnuts and then two airplane meals and you lost most of them that's so true yeah so breakfast is like a it's like a seafood noodle dish breakfast is a uh cultural construct [Music] kids now i have 482.93 not too bad not too bad let me check how much we need to book that flight on the second board yeah we need 175. okay so we need 700 without the quarter pick up three pound trash 550 that's pretty easy that's a pretty easy one i mean i would say do that and then do a parkour video yeah i mean i i think i agree at this point uh let's say we know we can finish let's pick up some trash yeah i mean we did not i swear we did not plant this i feel like that's a good pound right there look at this game is 1.4 we're halfway there already this is kind of heineken that's what i didn't left today oh great 1.7 oh no what do we got only two pounds [Music] oh wow it's the mother lode [Music] there we go what's that somehow we got all the way up to four [Music] that's my good deed for the internet for the day i'd say so my hands are supposed to go the aftermath of all that trash that's enough i think that's enough it feels so gross it might not be though it's got it [Music] uh do you think we should like follow the canal and find trick spots there or like go to the park or what [Music] go go go go [Music] you know keep going [Music] keep going keep going keep going keep that was so extreme all right so i edited together our parkour video we fulfilled the requirements we have the the music i found some old stock music left my computer we have the transitions we have everything i'll probably touch it a little bit more before you see it but you don't even know that so here it is i want you to jump from there to there come on come on we're gonna do it quickly our core is not slow keep going keep going keep going nice job you got it keep going keep going go go go go go how do you dodge all those cars yeah you made it that was so extreme oh my god please he's keeping going he's still going it's probably enough or you can keep going i guess you can keep going that's fine that is extreme parkour ladies and gentlemen all right with that parkour we earned um we earned another 75 bucks or one quarter of 300 bucks so our total is 695.43 which means we have enough to book our onward flight to seoul just in the next time because we're about to get over to the airport um and we need our onward flight before we can check in so i'm going to book that on the way let me get there [Music] joseph you're ready for ben yes [Music] thank you very much do you remember when i woke you up or was i just i remember but then i like literally i remember you woke me up and then i just like my consciousness just faded right back out well a little tired you know circumnavigating the world [Music] but how long 36 hours here's the problem when you're on a 12-hour flight you'd think you would sleep for most of it but in new york the hours that we were on the flight are what like 7 a.m to 7 p.m right like prime awake hours yeah really perfect uh foresight by us okay we finally made it that was almost two hours of check-in security and immigration literally two hours of bureaucracy really glad we came here early and we're not even done yet now we have to go to another document check not complaining very grateful to travel but man is it a lot of work during coven [Music] gotta get the shots [Music] thank you [Music] oh it's hot it's gonna be so hot outside oh god [Music] hello welcome to singapore it's very bright and very hot but it's very pretty i mean take a look really lovely here by the airport um so we did the math on the flight and we're pretty sure we have exactly one dollar and 26 cents left and we don't have a plan we don't know where we're going from here i don't think that we can really get much further before the rest period uh but we're going to look into it probably need to go to australia we're not going to hit the distance requirement but we can't get to australia before the rest period we should check bali they only have forts jakarta georgetown fanoi bangkok who had hot yacht we could justify going somewhere else because we could earn more money but then we would also have to spend more money to get there so unless we could get somewhere really cheaply it doesn't really make sense for us to leave singapore i need a shower so badly yeah so how much money do we need 791 to get to sydney but then we're gonna need to build onward travel from city so we need basically just twelve hundred dollars well we could knock that out with just money jumping can we go bungee jumping here absolutely yeah all right this place opens a little afternoon sky park santosa the good news is we have a plan we'll land in singapore with just enough time to earn twelve hundred dollars by bungee jumping at a place called sky park santosa bungee jumping at a place called sky park santosa sky park sentosa this place opens a little afternoon sky park synthosa we have looked at all the options and it turns out that we actually can't get anywhere that would make sense to go to so we're just saying it in singapore for a while we're gonna go try to go bungee jumping so we can make a lot of money and there's a lot of bungee jumping options here and that will be funny probably so we're very excited to see you there we have no idea what's happening we're just getting on the train let's get on this train should we i don't know [Music] [Music] do you just do just one madam two sews of bruce willis that's all you need we uh we got changed adam had a shower i didn't i should have but i got a little drink and uh we're headed to our bungee jumping appointment at this horrible device in front of us which is so much taller than it looked in the pictures uh so see it's gonna be great [Music] we've got our tickets we're about to go up they said no loose items but we bought a thing that's gonna like strap a gopro to us so cut to us being really scared now you're forwarding point all right five four three two one this episode of jet lag is now over which i know is sad however the good news is that i have already planned out almost your entire

doing challenges we're one day in so if you haven't watched episode one there are about to be some spoilers me and joseph just took off from cancun amsterdam meaning we're going to be the first team to arrive in europe ben and adam are in new york about to board a flight to milan the route from milan to thailand just fell apart due to delays so they're boarding their flight to italy with no plan at all all right well our thailand passes got approved moments after our thailand plan fell apart incredible we're really confused about what sam and joseph are up to i mean it's been like 12 hours no challenges they haven't completed any challenges before so it's hopefully cut to them doing some really huge challenge right now [Music] all right our microphone like word right so if we sound worse that's why sorry absolutely massive update i i don't know how he didn't see this place um there is a 1 50 pm direct from milan to singapore 696 dollars that's a lot of money a lot of money but it's but we would have you know four hours to try to earn it and if we can earn that money this is an amazing [Music] [Music] all right we finally made out of customs yeah it took a really nice close look at joseph's package i have a brand new passport that only has one stamp on it from mexico from yesterday so which looks a little it's a little sauce okay so now we need to decide what we're doing i mean definitely go do a challenge i feel like the museum one would be pretty easy either that one or the top five attraction one that's pretty high value and i looked it's like the reich's museum the van gogh museum which right now they're all pretty close yeah i mean i don't know is that how much is that worth that one's worth like i think like 900 bucks oh wow let's just do that pretty high value one that hasn't been done yet again if it's all if they're all like right next to each other we need to snipe that before they get the get it in milan let's uh let's get a train to the city though all right let's do it yeah oh yeah because i want to use public transport only i think yeah we [Music] welcome to italy mamma mia [Music] while we're on the plane we looked at a ton of options we had all these different plans we you know we originally wanted to go paris to bangkok but then we missed the paris flight we actually got in after it even left then we were thinking we would go to london and then singapore but then we realized we were idiots and there's a direct flight from milan to singapore at 1 50 pm we just need to earn a ton of money yeah that's the problem we have to earn a lot of money and so the best way to do that is going to be by building a go-kart [Music] we we put the go-kart challenge on there like last minute sort of as a joke we did not think anyone was gonna do it we did a ton of research on the plane we've looked at like yeah every single hardware store near the airport i found one that sells wheels i've done so much research about wheels i now know the italian word for wheels it's round dough no that can't be right i don't know the italian word for wheels but we're going to brico center and we're going to attempt to buy everything we need to build a go-kart we've got some caffeine so it looks like we have to visit the reichs museum the vondel park the anne frank museum the van gogh museum yeah and the anne frank easier sorry not the vancouver thing the the jordan which is right next to the that's all yeah those are all right here yes the jordan and the anne frank museum are right next to each other and then the three others [Music] all right baby we are at the brico center everyone's favorite reason to come to italy we need wheels something like this would be good that's enough to ride on i've got a whole wheel section here those red ones are pretty sick huh let's go bigger okay now we're gonna need screws to screw that onto there stick up through the wood a little bit it's fine boy i sure hope they're not doing this right now [Music] we've made it to the anne frank house famous for being the house of anne frank yep that's right is it not actually in her house i don't know they've updated it i feel like you're not supposed to renovate history historic landmarks all right let me do some googling here we go [Music] all right now now we need to find the jordan which i think is really just this neighborhood so let's go down there and turn right okay so attraction one out of five done we got to make pace because i think there's a good chance that ben and adam are trying to did you sit in that [Music] look [Music] you ready to build a go-kart buddy yeah but where what a great question pick up the pace joseph so i'm gonna be honest i have no idea what the jordan is or why it's an attraction i don't either it's like a neighborhood i guess and it looks nice but it kind of also just looks like the rest of amsterdam the sign says jordan therefore we're in jordan just if you're like purposely pushing your chin logistic force that's that's that's when wendover gets its own private army we're gonna call it the logistic force it's looking for tram 19. 19. it leaves like now o'clock everything comes down to this epic movement i think music starts now there's one trail this one tram we don't make this tram we give up right now right yeah we're going to get into a nice hotel and sleep we made our tram we demanded it i guess we have to keep trying all right we have about what like an hour and a half max to build a go-cart we're gonna go quick stiamo construendo go-kart [Music] either this is going to be an epic sequence of competing the finishes that the saint paul ben and adam are doing this we're going to look like idiots yeah either way [Music] here's the rex museum three two one smile [Music] okay we got it got that one all right uh then go museum that's that right it rolls it looks very dangerous oh it's very dangerous [Music] [Music] man look at how intermodal this street is keep walking are you stopping no i'm not i'm talking i'm walking and talking all right [Music] all right joseph what's what's your prediction that ben and adam are up to right now [Music] we call it the mamma mia there's an italian man right there adam don't be insensitive that's not inceptive i just have to find somewhere to ride this thing let's go let's should go visit the us consulate yeah let's go do it yeah let's make some money you know remember for our second challenges in the city we only get half of the value yeah we're right now we're right there so we may as well let's go don't use your phone on the internet to look up where your local conflict is luckily if i remember correctly and i'm pretty sure i do we are within walking distance yeah um i'm pretty sure it's right on that square sam's kind of cheating though because he's been here before i know where things are i mean it's kind of perfect we're not gonna get a better incline than that i mean this is actively dangerous oh it's super dangerous would you like me to do it i don't know what do you think i mean you got really stuff on the last one you okay you got it should we get some elevation look for flags all right looking for american flags i don't see any all right so it has to go down the incline without falling apart that's the key oh god [Music] i did it it did fall apart not the important part i don't know in fact does that count yeah it counts seat hurts so much [Music] here we go [Music] incredible all right now that we got it all right well that building has a whole lot of security cameras oh here we go let's [Music] all right should we sit down somewhere and strategize because there's a bench over there should we go to the bench yeah let's do it we really have not talked much about what we're doing after this point because i don't really know what we're doing after this point yes like legitimately easier right which country we're going yeah actually i don't know where we're gonna go next yeah exposed screws you gotta hurry [Music] it's pretty tall ciao all right we checked the prices have it changed let's check the prices 6.98 we need ten dollars we're ten dollars short so we can just have to do any challenge okay let's decide on one really quick find a flight that goes from amsterdam to budapest at 125 which is in two hours from now 190 each so we can do that and then there's a flight that leaves at 11 30 p.m that goes from budapest to dubai for only 240 dollars if we do it it gives us enough time in budapest to complete a challenge and then get on the flight to dubai i mean it gets into buy one it gets at 7 30 a.m tomorrow in dubai 8 pm and then and then the rest period doesn't start to like 3 p.m okay so we haven't mentioned this yet but so that nobody dies the game gets pause for a 20-hour rest period after the first 48 hours that means we need to be on the ground and in a hotel at 3 p.m dubai time yeah so hypothetically vessel gives us some time to leave from dubai or do a challenge in dubai yeah i mean it sounds sounds like a good option and it sounds like the best option we have now we might have to do it we might just have to do it because like if we're gonna do it we have to do it now okay let's do it okay okay so we need literally 10 more dollars to book the flight to singapore so we can any challenge we just got to get it done before our flight leave we could go get drunk on a local liquor we could go do we could go do a piggyback ride around a local park we could go try and find a regional exclusive mcdonald's item we could try and buy a hat that's worth more than a hundred dollars there are lots of clothing boutiques around here but if we decide on that we're locked in that's true we're locked in i think we should look look for local parks yeah let's look for a park first and then let's decide all right we just called an uber and i guess i'm gonna book that flight while we're in the uber since it leaves in like exactly two hours at least exactly two hours from now oh no what uh he can't book within two hours and literally three minutes ago they came within you go away oh my god the worst timing wow so we're literally three minutes late okay we're getting an uber two parco mameli [Music] i'm super excited to carry adam around the park well this is beautiful so for this challenge we have to give each other piggy backs around the perimeter of a local park we're here at parco mameli we don't have a lot of time so we're going to go as fast as possible we're allowed to switch off at any point we just have to get all the way around all right we got it we got it we got it we're doing great i've not seen a lot of good options into dubai i mean we could trade doha yeah but i don't like doha has a budget airline like by dubai it doesn't really uh man i feel like stuck like this this is where planning would have been really useful yeah i know ben and adam definitely had the advantage oh easy this is easy oh you're doing so good all right thank you thank you thank you all right here switch we [Music] should i keep recording this park is beautiful it's really lovely it's a lovely day in italy we haven't slept in so long oh my god are you done yeah all right two three ah we're not going spectacularly we just can't find a good route and we're really burning time while we're doing it so like it's stressful in a lot of different ways yeah right now we're just trying to find good wi-fi there are our bags almost there uh okay you want to say gosh okay [Music] money in the bank great work buddy let's get to the airport hey sam thinks he's finally found something tonight out of amsterdam at 9 25 p.m there is a non-stop flight to singapore that would cost 1 604 total between the two of us that's a lot the rest period um ends at 3 p.m in singapore time on sunday sorry i have tons of tabs 25 a.m on monday from singapore there is a non-stop flight into seoul which is a country that we can transit through that is 629 totally from seoul there is a 240 flight to lax it costs 2 200 for the two of us i think this is our best shot it would just require really grinding with the challenges because i mean in order to leave tonight if we were to do that and prices could change at any moment you need to earn 998.11 in the next eight hours great work you did it thank you five minutes away we're gonna make it eight hours or nine hundred dollars i think that's doable all right i think we have no other choice i mean i just don't see a better option all right let's do it we have to we have no choice so gotta fly to singapore tonight yeah let's just start grinding in amsterdam and fly straight to singapore tonight enrico is right around the corner we're going to singapore baby i cannot wait for you guys to see what happens in singapore because it kind of gets crazy as you probably know by now you can watch that next episode right now if you're a nebula subscriber every episode goes out one week early on

https://registry.goldstandard.org/credit-blocks/details/279220","Gta43oOV4Ag","all right we're about to race to Circuit navigate the world first I want to get back here to Denver Union Station and touch this flagpole wins I'm gonna go for a walk oh all right all right let's go go no I think let's go let's try going this way [Music] this way I just checked we don't need to rush too much the train doesn't leave for 15 minutes to the airport so no running how do you howdy [Music] we can start talking strategy now right okay so one big thing that uh Ben and Adam don't know is my dad works for American Airlines and he's working right now any Insider information we need about American flights that is good yeah we can call them the cinema the problem is I think American flights are expensive and the name of the game you know since we accumulate budget by doing challenges want to keep it cheap each team starts with a thousand dollars to earn more money we have to do challenges from this list but we'll talk more about that later let's buy tickets and then talk about how to do that let's get airport tickets where are those kids look at them they look so confident this is our foes our competition if you can even call with that so true dude okay so the first step is to get to Denver International Airport we're in Denver Union Station we're gonna have to get on a flight to get started we should actually hustle a little bit I'm really making a statement [Music] s the train doesn't leave for 12 minutes I'm gonna start looking up flights to the east coast basically the way that this is definitely going to go is that we're going to fly to the east coast and then we'll get a flight across the Atlantic now my assumption is that we're going to go to New York because biggest Hub and it's probably going to be the cheapest place to get to from Denver but I need to double check that there they are [Music] Ben and Adam has started with a huge leg up because you know we have jobs yeah to be fair they have jobs but it just happens at their job is creating the scan yeah you don't have opportunity for simulation we did we definitely don't we're gonna we're gonna beat them so hard I could basically all my work into the transatlantic Life by creating the spreadsheets like I went through every International Airport in the US looked at the cheapest flights were put on this convention when I calculated each by the cost per mile here's the thing the cheapest system cost per mile flights are ones that I don't think they're gonna know about and here's why okay they're charter flights and charter flights don't show up on Google flights so you don't think these are in their simulations unless they specifically went to the chewy website yeah looked from Cancun to all across Europe they wouldn't have found it so we're going to Cancun maybe get a 7 A.M to Chicago it's not terrible where could we get to from Chicago well we could get to Iceland the problem is going to Iceland doesn't really actually give you much more distance right there's a minimum distance requirement that we have to hit in order for it to count so you can't just like go up to the Arctic Circle and go around and usually if you're adding an extra stop you would want to add distance but Iceland's exactly on the way it's like yeah okay the cheapest flooding people the only one that we can afford to both we have support current budget a thousand bucks without doing a challenge is an afternoon that leaves at 3 10. so I'm pretty sure this will get us to Europe for that we just think that New York New York has the most options and it's also like one of the cheapest places for us to get right now it's kind of the obvious play but the reason it's the obvious play is that I think it's the best play it's also the greatest city in the world that's so true yeah so it seems like we have a choice do we want to be risk here in Denver with getting a flight it's more risky or making a connection because we're gonna get to the airport at 5 55 and then there's the 7 A.M Frontier flight okay or we could take an 8 A.M United flight they'll be assessed with a two hour later what do you think is the best Strat here I really don't know so 7am yeah let's just do it okay all right wow we've got our boarding passes okay so it says we can't get a broadcast which is a problem because we have a really tight time at the airport yeah so uh we were not uh counting on this all right we got lucky in the train arrived like five minutes early but we really gotta yeah I know should we join the runners yep that's good [Music] yeah that security line is looking chunky oh wow it keeps going that is not a good scary line well this is bad uh oh God oh no [Music] you see the huge mass of people yeah that's the frontier line [Music] oh my God oh my God never seen anything like this I don't know if we're gonna make our flight then you get it to work no what the my words thank you that's the general so I don't think it's open so it's good for security so this is like a secret I keep walking keep walking yeah all right I mean this looks much better fingers crossed it's still a chunky line it's all chunky but not like well I checked the wait time this is the quickest so this is our our best shot so there's actually a way shorter security line that's kind of hidden on the bridge to Terminal A so that's the one we're going to but Ben and Adam definitely don't know that we've been wanting to find the end of the line for like five minutes this could take hours how is this possible oh we found the end of the line not exaggerating this line is more than half a mile I mean this is one of the most insane things that I mean there must be some horrible problem at Denver International right now just by the way if we don't make this fight to Cancun all the money we spent on our tickets will be gone and we'll be stuck in Denver doing challenges for God knows how long until we can afford new ones okay so while we're waiting to find we have nothing to do um we're gonna try and apply for our Thailand e-visas because those might take up to 48 hours to process so if we're gonna go through Thailand we got to do this like now so the reason Ben and Adam are applying for Thailand passes is because of this flight from Paris to Bangkok on Thai Airways it leaves every day at 1 40 in the afternoon and it's one of the absolute cheapest ways to get from Europe to Southeast Asia usually just over 400 a person if they can get to Europe fast enough to get on this flight it could give them a huge advantage doors closed in five minutes Joseph back up full size so I'm going and pleading we already closed it I'm just kidding it's fine it's so boring dude I ran so hard yeah that's like the hardest I've ever had what do you think I'm gonna guess if they went through that other line I think no I didn't see them in our security line so so hopefully they missed their Club yeah hopefully I've never hoped that somebody missed a fight before you know in competition in an in-friendly competition I'm a little worried I am very worried it's gonna be tight it's gonna be really tight all right it's right ahead all right we are um all right we are on the flight to New York and uh we're gonna start looking for our next flight out of New York to Europe okay so look at all these big numbers 1300 1200 1600. but if you zoom into Italy what do you find you can get some Milan for 8.44 that's for the both of us and better yet it's like at a perfect time it's on a airline called NEOS this flight happens once a week only on Thursdays we've seen it before in the simulations leaves at 5 p.m we get into New York at 1pm so we have about four hours to do challenges and all we'll have to do is earn about 300 in order to get on this flight which should be very doable there's nowhere that we could go bungee jumping in New York right I don't think that we could get too easily we could probably buy the hat but I want to earn more money though yeah we could try to catch a fish but it feels like too big of a risk there could be ketchup Ketch of fish in New York oh and by the water I mean go to the ocean can't touch snow eat a bug probably not local liquor not enough money hardcore video maybe paintball no no I really think it's the pastry mile I think you're right I think that's that's just our best option by far Sam and Joseph were not on our flight to New York they're going to New York they've been on that flight so I wonder where they are [Music] all right we made it yep we got through stuff wanted we're in Cancun and I was excited to go to Milan uh but we still don't have enough money to book that flight we're still like 300 ish dollars short plus we'll need to book continuing flight after that right um so we have to do a challenge we're gonna do the local pastry Mile and we'll explain what that is in a minute foreign pastry shop and it's only a few meters from a track so it's a really good spot we're here because the local pastry mile is going to involve one of us Adam running a mile but after every single lap and before it starts he has to eat one local iconic pastry to the region which is New York yeah so let's go uh yeah can I get three red velvet Donuts uh can I also get a black and white cookie can I just get one more red velvet Donuts you actually get two I'm gonna eat one foreign got three of these [Music] and then we've got one of these and it's massive oh it's I'm Gonna Save that one for the end three two one go how's the donut I mean it's really good they're giving you the power you need to run one mile it's really dense thank you all right that's donut number one down go Adam you got this Adam was the best track and field runner in his hometown back in high school so I have every faith that uh he has what it takes [Music] we're trying to figure out how to navigate through this airport yeah it really wants you to lose it's like it shuttles you into like this area with tons of shuttle things yeah there's like no way out so we're trying to get around yeah donut number two how are you feeling really bad all right go go go lap number two I don't think our flight's on the board yeah I mean it's like a special Charter right all right let's look around I guess water at least this one has a chunkness I think that's kind of good I genuinely don't know if I can do this [Music] three you got this all right turns out we got to take a shuttle to Terminal Two here's your water okay do you want the donut or do you want the cookie the only Donuts let me try the cookie okay I'm not gonna finish a bite this Chewbacca has to be the donut donut number four he's gonna take a little rest look at that it was a big chunk of that donut you just got there you're an inspiration oh all right we're checked in got the got the tickets I don't think we have so it's 1 p.m flight music 3 20. yeah uh and all challenges have to be done five miles away from the airport so I don't think we have time no with only two hours no I don't think we've got time enough to go out and do one well now you have more room in your stomach I just want to say this now if we do win this race it will have been earned and we wouldn't be able to do a very big challenge we'll only be able to do a low value one yeah so I say let's just don't worry about it yeah are you okay do you need to stop [Music] he's off he's off folks [Music] foreign take a little lie down Adam take a little lie down are you ready to go to Italy all right we just got word they completed their first challenge they did a pastry mile well they were running a mile and we're eating Panda Express I think we're the real winners here and we're also about to be on the flight to Europe already and they're not yeah so I think we're still I think we're still ahead yeah see I wonder where they are sorry to all the nice people at McCarran Park whose afternoons I've ruined if it makes you feel any better we're going to be leaving the country immediately okay Adam I don't mean to alarm you but that flight is gone this is another one there is another one it's not that much more expensive and it only leaves a half hour later the Neo's flight is gone we're gonna take this Delta flight gets us in a little later but this is all we got without that Neo's flight Ben and Adam are going to get to Europe later and with less money than they thought they might be acting chill now but it's going to make their already tight plan even tighter all right we've got our uh tickets to Italy not on the flight we wanted but on one that's just a half hour later and a little bit more expensive I I did a little research I'm pretty sure I have a confident guess on which flight they're on I'm pretty sure based on when they complete their challenge It lines up with how long it would have taken them to fly to the east coast yeah and kind of get out of the airport if they flew to say New York but in New York there's a very cheap flight to Milan leaving at 5 30 getting in at 7 45 a.m tomorrow on Delta it seems to be the cheapest East Coast Flight available our competitive Advantage is uh our distance we have more distance so they're they're going to run into distance issues later or not so my absolute pure chance uh-huh right now I'm uploading a video about character no way it's about it's about how Cancun was like discovered by a computer as the mathematically perfect vacation destination and this is the was the mathematically yeah most perfect yes and and then Mexico like invested in it because it was mathematically perfect that is really interesting this was totally true total by chance literally right now uploading this video we were we were kind of worried that we were going to miss our flight but good news it got delayed also bad news that got delayed our odds of getting to Paris in time to make the flight to Bangkok which were already tight it might have just become impossible we'll just have to find another route yeah okay so our flight to Milan is now getting in at 8 30 which is two hours later than we thought we were going to get in when when we thought we were going to get in at 6 30 there was this route we had in mind where we were gonna fly back to Paris at 9 10 and then take a 140 flight to Bangkok which is really cheap and one of the best ways to get to South East Asia now it seems like that's not possible because we would have to get on a 9 10 to Paris and we're gonna get in at 8 30. and we would have to earn the money to buy that flight to Paris in Milan in 40 minutes so we're probably gonna have to find a different route all told um things might be falling apart a little bit yeah am as episode one done however if you want to watch the next one and see what we both get up to in Europe all you've got to do is subscribe to nebula the next episode is up right now on nebula in fact every episode of jet lag the game goes out one week early on nebula and that's great because it's really easy to sign up there's also plenty of reason to subscribe to nebula for more than just chat lag there's Wendover on there there's half as interesting on there there's so many great other channels that we know you already watched and a lot of these channels have made law inform Originals with big budgets some of the best stuff they ever made ourselves included we've done plenty of Originals over on Wendover and Hai what makes nebula even better is the best way to subscribe to it it's actually cheaper to subscribe through curiosity stream because they run this bundle deal where if you sign up for any of their subscriptions at our link curiositysting.com jet lag they also threw in a nebula subscription so that means you get all curiosity stream which has tons of great documentaries and non-fiction Series in fact we even made one it's this one the Colorado promo Rural and the red you can watch it over there

episodes one and two because they're about to be major spoilers exactly now if brian and i can claim montana we'll be able to connect four states and win the game ben and adam are currently sitting on a tiny plane in salt lake city that's about to take off to butte montana and as it just so happens that's the exact flight me and brian just boarded this is gonna be an interesting finish [Music] we were like if they're not on this flight we win [Music] my god oh my god if for some reason we can't get into this airport [Music] okay so there's a there was an open seat next to sam so i've sent ben to go sit in it so that he could get out first because the car is under his name [Music] focus i forgot my code at adam's apartment so i am not happy about this oh that's an affordable takeoff well i don't know what it is because like visibility doesn't seem bad just to give you a quick update we came in here to view the approach and due to the fact that the winds are going out of the north at about 20 miles an hour and it says we have to do what's called a circle of land and land on the other runway then certainly maneuver is kind of a tight one the low clouds and made it for some very poor visibility keep everybody safe we are at this point going back to salt lake city we hope you understand and appreciate the safety of the matter we will be arriving salt lake here shortly we'll let you know [Music] how did you see him that was a bit of a curveball yeah literally was it literally it's kind of a purge definitely have more money than us so they're going to go to a nicer hotel well probably like a lot of hotels are booked so we need to go and i would encourage you to be quick too we have been forced to buy a much more expensive hotel than we would have liked because it's the only option available but uh ultimately we're actually feeling really good because weirdly this is actually great for us because it gives us a chance to grab utah before either of us can get to montana which means that if we get montana we actually win now so sort of a weird blessing in disguise we think the game's going to end in montana assuming we can get utah tomorrow morning yeah i just want to watch the rugby i told you not to get in the mindset of being able to watch the rugby if it'll predict the snowstorm stopping us from landing probably a meteorologist okay so our flight was rescheduled to 7 45 tomorrow morning that means that if either team wants to claim utah they'll have just over three hours to do it after we wake up good morning sam good morning brian it's the last day yeah it's gonna be the worst day i think why you know why okay uh we have to go claim utah because they're doing the same yes okay let's go let's get an uber [Music] good morning my friends it is sometimes it's like 4 17. yeah it's like 4 20. blaze it head to the utah street it's gonna be beautiful [Music] hello sam hey how you doing [Music] i think joe biden will be awake when we get there [Music] probably not in front yes sir all right so if you just get in front and just let us out we'll just run right up i'm filming all right come on go go go go go go pretty pretty it's pretty majestic okay i think i would give it seven okay okay well let's draw cards together let's draw cards together okay fair enough okay all right okay okay here we go it's the way i'm shuffling your pulling right we were hoping you guys would just sleep in uh all right okay all right i'm shuffling one sec this is my hotel room card this is my money um oh wait your wrong pocket card all right ready one two three go big one hey eat the state dish we can't do that yeah yeah we can't do it detail plant a local paint a local landscape yeah we can just miss it because there's nowhere i'd say for that get a pedicure there's no there's not gonna be anywhere open dismiss okay there's not gonna be any more open dismiss dismiss attend a local event i'm definitely gonna well okay we can claim that we can't do that and then we get a free another draw paint your teammates faces state flag we can do that okay all right where can we get paint we got to get to like a dwayne reed or something dwayne reed we're not in new york anymore adam here start start calling an uber there's a cvs 2.3 no it opens at 9am oh god what's open right now look for a walmart look for walmart mom baby what is

at 5am jello jello is easy we could make joe okay i'm actually the same dessert yes that's what it has i remember this and on brand yellow okay we need a grocery store we can do this we can do this how far away is the uber [Music] what i thought you got the uber no oh maybe i did no i did i did i did never mind oh my god they're so far away 18 minutes away oh wait wait wait i'm so sorry my name's adam and i'm here to say we need one dollar in a major way okay so yeah please stop well that was unfortunate he does not enjoy that i'm wait i'm gonna try for any cars coming by just do a little jig oh my god he's like stopping cars on the street jesus christ 4 30 a.m thank you so much thank you good job adam [Music] we got it baby these are houses literally [Music] sam yeah we've just uh this is the greatest moment of my life bye fellas see in montana [Music] so we're going to pentana i mean there's not really another option they've no money man yeah but they they have the flight as long as they can get a rental car which i assume you can because flight's just same one from last night yeah and they have six states in route three yeah i guess so yep gotta gotta get montana so kind of 50 50 shot [Music] see you there fellas [Music] very close to my face we made it this time i'll steal your wife go go go go [Music] go you won't need to play being bullied in this airplane and you need to stand up in front of him [Music] oh here we go [Music] all right give this a thus look for signs for avis rental cars this way [Music] they're not they're not open yet they're not open yet i've never seen something like this they're not open until 10 a.m oh no everything's cold okay we're gonna have to try hertz after them okay thank you very much thank you [Music] very fortunate [Music] yeah i mean it's gonna take them a while it looks like they went to hertz to try to yeah to try to rent with their because it could take a while to like put their info and stuff yeah that was um that definitely bought us at least five minutes [Music] we might be losing that five minute advantage already these doors yeah i think so okay oh it's chilly okay we made it okay so they our car rental place avis was not open it didn't open until 10. so we had to switch to hertz which meant that they got out only a couple minutes before us so we're right behind them but they are ahead they are ahead a little bit but they're ahead gorgeous lots all right so here's the deal um we're very strict about speed limits on this so that none of us get an advantage by breaking the law you can see i'm going 43 and we're in 45 we'll try to get us exactly 45 but we're being both we both agreed to be very strict with speed limits especially with the roads being a little bit icy i don't want to crash and die for the sake of youtube content i mean actually would make good content yeah but on the other hand if it's adam and ben it's pretty good content engine coolant temp high stop check engine [Music] okay okay we need to we need to pull over it's like not letting me go very fast okay we went a little too fast and now the car is freaking out drive start control malfunction it's a little drive start control malfunction we're kind of just gonna we're gonna take it slow for now and hope maybe that goes away maybe that'll go away what do you think adam i don't know adam doesn't know okay open up the owner's manual open up the owner's manual yeah throw your bag somewhere oh okay okay we've pulled over on the side of the road i'm doing some light reading in the okay hurry hurry toyota corolla [Music] this is great entertainment well the coolant will cool down and i think what happened is that the car the woman at the car rental place mentioned that she had not started up the car earlier that day which i think means that the something was too cold and by going fast again we did not go over the speed limit but we sped up to 80. we sped up to 80. we overheated the engine somehow so i'm hoping that if we just sit here well we don't have many other options because i don't i don't know if you know your way around the engine of a toyota corolla okay i'm gonna call the hertz uh see if maybe if they know um we just rented a car from you guys like maybe 15 or 20 minutes ago and it's it seems to be having a problem the engine coolant has overheated or something do you know what to do okay great dani just keep on going okay okay great thanks very much thanks bud bye i sure hope sam and brian are doing something entertaining right now for you i see the appeal of montana on my empty beautiful species i like the snow too there's now snowing on the road and i'm a little bit uncomfortable i'm not we were kind of doing some doing some math i think they have six cards and i think we have eight left so that's what like uh 14 total that means out of 14 cars there are there are uh three that are claimed the state immediately and for either of us even though they're like five minutes behind us um for either of us if either of us pull one of those it's game over right there so that's a distinct possibility this could be this could be done very quickly or not um what about the card that says we have to book our next flight without using i i looked at the language of that and i think how it works is it says claim the state immediately but in order to book your next flight you must do this okay we don't have to book a next flight okay and we've claimed the state immediately therefore we've got connect four i'm pretty sure wow sam you're so diligent with the speed limit so responsible so i sure hope ben and adam are being so responsible too so we're presently freezing to death it's very cold in the car the heating doesn't seem to really be like working as well as it feels like it should be so right now we're less concerned about winning the game and more concerned with living is what i would say hey this is what the engine sounds like i don't know if you can hear the engine but it sounds really bad and it also smells really not right it might explode but i still want to sit in the car cause it's so it's so cold here [Music] you should you need to get my jacket you're you're you need more layers buddy i'm fine i don't know take my insulated no no put my jacket on you got gloves and a hat once i put my gloves in half put your gloves and hat on here's an extra sweatshirt and a jacket check out my uh my new fit it's called the ben doesn't die in a broken down car in montana we died doing what we loved losing connect4 to sam the check engine visit your dealer drive start control malfunction okay okay we think they're here we think that's them behind us although they asked us not to film them so yeah we might have to do yeah okay jump cut to our new car we are gonna get back on the road as fast as possible yeah and then we're gonna catch up and we're gonna win there's our old car here i i'm so worried that people are gonna think we faked this somehow um okay we don't know enough about cars to fake this okay new car wave goodbye to the old car my old car show it in the rear view mirror i think you can see it anyway um okay we're trying to catch up to sam we're not that far behind we think we can catch up if he gets a bad card so fingers crossed we're still in this game i don't know about you but i am tense i feel like the same way that i feel like when i'm like about to go on the ice of the hockey game or something or or like i don't know about to release a big video or something i am tense heart is part is racing brian's probably just like why can't i watch rugby i'm a sociopath so see that starbucks i stopped at that starbucks on a road nobody cares yes they do any final thoughts oh god i'm so nervous and i don't even know why that's too zoomed in i'm sorry come on brian come on come on this is the crucial moment okay let's go all right i got the cards for you we got the cards quick shuffle it's gotta be a good shuffle we don't want anyone disputing this come on show the camera okay is that a good enough shuffle yeah oh this is a lot of pressure what do you think that one yes yes how you feeling adam you know i think there's still a chance they could veto themselves into a corner with pedicure or um the local event um and if they do those things and we can get something quickly we still have a shot snowing and the roads are getting a little snowy so we're driving responsibly all right we're 10 minutes out from helena still no call from sam which means he hasn't claimed the state i think we're still in this thing we just got to get a good card when we get there you know ben four out of seven american flags it's kind of underwhelming it's a little drab a little drab it's a little dram you know i'm sorry to say it i think i'm going four out of seven american flags all right here we go here we go do you have the cards i've got them in my wallet all right let's go we are here in beautiful helena montana and it's very cold and also they've had a huge head start so we're going to pull these cards as fast as possible we're going to do a little shuffle shuffle shuffle shuffle our last shuffle of the game okay adam all right good one good one [Music] eat the steak dish [Music] okay you must eat at least one serving of the dish okay so that is hey guys oh no did you already get it they were hiding do you want it do you want to see what i have here [Music] congratulations [Music] you had to hide behind the thing well we okay yes we did why'd you do that we thought it would be suspicious oh you're right all right sam and brian you have won connect four congratulations oh good job you guys played a good game well done you guys have your gloves all set yeah cause we almost died in the cold we didn't have time to make a trophy but our editors are gonna photoshop a trophy into my hands right now okay you ready and now i'm gonna hand it be careful it's heavy oh my god the editor did such a good job with this all right and now lift it above your head triumphantly this is amazing wow well done and then all right it's a good conclusion so if you're watching

watch one this will all be nonsense to win a team must claim four states connected by a vertical or horizontal line states are claimed by going to the capital and completing a challenge and towards the end of day one the board looks like this and just so we can use the dramatic irony again the last thing i said was this yeah it would be really bad if they got arizona now let's go to adam and ben that's right we're in arizona the grand canyon stay baby sunny beautiful arizona i think it actually is the grand canyon state and uh this is the state capitol i i don't know what we this is a pretty good looking two out of seven this is like a two out of seven american flags this is not a very state capital i'm not very impressed ben pull a good one all right here we go the card is buy the local paper and solve one of the puzzles [Music] okay okay we can probably do that we can probably find a local paper it's 7 p.m so it might be a little difficult no local papers all right so we have to find a newspaper which we went to like a mini mart and didn't have them and then we checked into our hotel which was the just we just got the cheapest hotel that we could find they don't have any brian and i just checked in they gave us a free upgrade for some reason no idea why so look at this room brian and i each have one of these we paid 130 bucks probably gonna have some drinks you know get some dinner maybe do some gambling it's 6 p.m we're done for the night and we did the most strategically advantageous thing like it's not like we compromised so big fan of this so now we're actually walking to the airport where we were before um in an attempt to see if they have a newspaper we also have not confirmed that any of the newspapers actually have puzzles in them that's the situation please pirate hundred dollar bill [Applause] investors 31 or 13. okay the atlanta proceeds what does that mean we got all of those paid off [Music] everything's closed just like that 100 bucks becomes 200. see kids gambling does pay arizona republic okay prosper puzzle in a snowboard all right we got it can't imagine ben and adam are having uh done for the night in a 130 dollar one-room suite our hotel's name is howard johnson we're at the howard johnson i love that the hotel has a full person's name it's actually not called the howard johnson it's just called our job just like a guy we have a copy of the arizona republic the arizona republic which shook a stupidly long time to get like hours and it does have an insert two crossword puzzles and a sudoku but we are not going to do these puzzles tonight we are going to do them tomorrow so sam doesn't know where we are yeah because the best flight that they can make out of reno is to phoenix so we're hoping that they'll get to phoenix and then while they're in the air we'll claim phoenix and that will be very funny that will be very funny and we really hope that happens all right good night now we're getting some sleep because the first time we did a game like this there weren't any rules about sleep and it almost killed our cameraman so to solve it we fired the cameraman and also made a rule that you have to be in a hotel from 9 30 p.m to 4 30 a.m local time good morning good morning i wasn't expecting to have a camera in my face we're vloggers now brian where do you think we're going to end our day today brian [Music] i'm hoping it's not fair but how would that work the four states across yeah but we're going to santa fe now oh right yeah sorry i got a phoenix then yeah we only have a pen which is not good 38 across desert plants is cacti now this is good content hell yeah the people love this people are loving us solving a crossword puzzle slowly immediately 62 across layers of tire what's a layered look someone comment below is what a layer it is [Music] [Music] nymph what's a rhine nymph ben oh i wouldn't want to spoil it he's getting really nervous let's go to the airport we're back again filming in this weird we're crossing empty parking lots at five in the morning trying to solve a crossword puzzle okay we're really close here it's gotta be true aaa yeah you just gotta figure out what this is hey mom okay mom how is do you know how lorelai is spelled l-a-i at the end or l-e-i at the end l-e-i-l-e-i incredible thank you mom okay so we got today's crossword it's got the answers for yesterday's process and we have solved the crossword check for the sun we got it so that means that we have claimed arizona get god [Music] okay we just got to phoenix and while we were on our flight we got a video from ben and adam so we're gonna watch it now howdy sam and brian sam and brian we are in the beautiful grand canyon state arizona they're here they're in the airport we have just claimed it and god we hope so bad that you're on a plane to arizona right now oh my gosh i want so much for that to be the case wait they're at a southwest gate look at that that's the southwest gate because you know how they have like the boarding pillars yeah that's the southwest gate please please tell me that you'll be so friendly just anyway all right bye either d2 or d3 i think portland d3 they're going to portland they must be unless they're trying to do bus i feel like the only other choice would be santa fe so how about we go to our santa fe gate and if they're not there then we could like assume that they've probably gone to portland all right and then what do we do if they're not go to idaho maybe oh let's quickly go to the santa fe game see if we see them but if they're going to oregon i'll take them some time because they have to go all the way to salem salem right yeah and that's like an hour from portland so i have to get a rental car drive down claim it they'll take them a good like three four hours but arizona that forces us north so we have to get oregon washington or idaho montana i mean short of like searching the whole airport they're not here so i feel like we should operate on the assumption that they really got on that flight to port to portland yes you thank you okay um okay we are here in portland oregon we came here because sam just has too many easy paths to victory up north so we decided we had to just come up here and block him as quick as we could and this was as quick as we could get up here um the hitch is that uh we have to get back to the airport to board a flight at one so seeing as salem the capital of oregon is almost an hour from here we gotta really hurry uber's on its way uber's definitely the right call we don't have time to pick up a rental car or drop it off or drop it off so uber a little more expensive but worth it hit yeah i mean i think we're on the same page like santa fe doesn't make sense for us that would just be a purely defensive thing especially because that defensive if we can't win doesn't make any sense albuquerque is not a massive airport and santa fe is a tiny airport yeah yeah so we're gonna get stuck there yeah so they'll definitely get both and we'll be like we'll be trapped in her two states will be completely encircled yeah like i mean they've blocked off one of our three options and if they get portland and then usually we're gonna have to go to ipo as soon as one is one so that leaves in less than two hours what do you think did you just buy that all right two seats okay we're booked all right well we thought we were going to santa fe i was actually looking forward to going to santa fe but game comes first so we're off to boise idaho we're only like two or three flights a day i think non-stop from here to boise just happened that the next one an extra hour or so yeah and like was cheap so we're definitely really lucky a little update before we get to the capitol uh our uber driver warren uh has very generously offered to uh he's been helping us strategize he's actually really good at this game and he would definitely win if he was playing um but he has offered to uh to wait around for us uh and drive us back to portland or or elsewhere we need in in salem so uh this is gonna be really really helpful extremely helpful warren is uh gonna win us the game and that is incredible this is a crazy looking insane looking capital very cool i would give it six out of seven american play i also give it six out of seven it looks sort of dystopian but i sort of think yeah it's kind of scary all right we're in a hurry so we really should okay we are here in salem oregon the capital of oregon um we need to claim this state really really fast so i am going to present the cards to adam it's raining a little bit that's very on brand for oregon yeah okay okay um please be good for the love of god okay okay okay we i wanted to be good once [Music] bury a treasure [Music] oh we talked to you we didn't want this one okay the treasure must be worth at least 50 you must leave a conspicuous sign next to the treasure so that someone may find it it must be completely covered in at least three inches underground okay i think that we can do this though okay i think we can do this i think we just need to find some soft soil but we can't dig here this is like government property we can dig wherever we want okay oh we could go over into that dirt area yeah yeah this could work that should work the treasure must the full treasure must be three inches below the ground so it does have to be a little bit of a deep hole but i think we can do it so we don't really have time to buy anything to bury so we're going to have to bury some of our own stuff it has to be it worth at least 50 so we're going to bury adam's laptop charger because we know that that is worth more than 50 dollars and it's something that someone might want so um that's what's going underground difficult we'll say let's okay here's our sign hey we want a free laptop charger we buried ours under this tree please take it that should hopefully be clear enough to get someone to dig up adams laptop charger and use it for themselves i'm burying it [Music] we're burying carrying a treasure as part of a scavenger hunt if you want a free if you want a free laptop charger then you should uh come and grab it it should be really easy to dig up [Music] yeah you can once we leave you're gonna we're gonna leave this on and then please dig it up because we really want someone to take it we've already found someone who i think wants to dig up our treasure show one two three yeah it's easily three inches all right it's here's our sign [Music] it's not garbage this kid is gonna dig it up and claim a free laptop charger it's free it's yours it's worth 80. that means that we have claimed oregon baby [Music] so we got another video so let's go find everything quite a spot and make sure that they get there greetings from oregon losers what's up we got organ get wrecked okay well that was that was great that was pretty your videos are much better than this but we're gonna have to rush them kind of but they're like running you know is that yeah they're like booking we need to run we should figure out they're probably like russian get back to a fight hey hello this is bryan mcmanus reporting from the state capital of idaho i don't know here re restart i don't know if i was recording hello my name is brian mcmanus no i'm going to start that again hello this is bryan mcmanus reporting from the state capital of idaho 222. so i'll go to this one bless you find a statue and recreate it a statue must be at least 100 meters from the capitol building why is it in meters or in america you must not use the internet to locate a statue you must hold the post for at least five minutes five minutes we could go in and find a statue of jesus is that not okay what is it would it be a bit faux pas to recreate a statue of jesus on the cross um that'd be a tough position to hold for five minutes so what are we doing sam cause brian forgot to record and i'm saying this extemporaneously we're gonna go on the roof of this parking garage and get a view to try to find like a park or something oh elevator access requires state access card present access card damn it let's go to the other one unless we can no just all right uh security [Music] noise we're on the government parking garages hopefully we don't get gunned down by security or something i don't see any super close parks no there's a hospital there i feel like a hospital could have a statue what if we commission a statue all right it's starting to take some time yeah and for all we know they're on the way to somewhere yeah i don't think they can get there today though we should double check i don't think they can we are going to make our really tight flight um that we were really worried about that we think almost sort of guarantees that we're going to be able to win i mean not 100 but like pretty close we have enough budget left for like one big play tomorrow morning which we think we can use to win the game um but if anything goes wrong like this flight gets messed up or our play in the morning gets messed up or sam has done something we didn't expect all of those things would essentially take us off the board and then we're toast oh i feel like we're in the perfect spots for statues but but alas we need to write a letter the governor of idaho it's like yo maybe any remaining trip budget we we give to idaho to make more statues specifically more than 100 meters away from the capitol yes i feel like that's a big hospital look at that that i feel like a big hospital like that could have like a little memorial thing you know uh uh posed as a piece of trash i'll do that every day so that was the joke brian you can't make a joke out of my joke i commandeered your jokes that is a that is a statue a child a green giant i mean is it a statue is it a i mean what else would you describe it as that's a statue but it's not do it do you think that's i don't know if it counts as a statue i feel like what else would you describe it as a street sign probably i think that counts as a status let's do a lap around that seems like you can find something more suited this is like a perfect statue this one is just like a standing straight up it's not problematic it's all good why is it in their memory though their bodies doesn't say that both of us have to do it so i'll just look like i'm talking to you okay well i guess you can't talk because then you wouldn't be still don't you want to do it right here oh wait you can't respond [Music] it's dedicated to the memory of 610 graduates of st luke's hospital training school for the nurses also i guess we're at st luke's hospital i'm going to look up what that is luke's hospital hotel on wikipedia why is it only 1906 to 1956 kind of cool i can't all be dead right no i really don't have enough snacks it's pretty easy actually i think we have enough time for lunch here seconds until fruit snacks okay you may have the fruit snacks i don't  want the honey you want fruits they definitely all died in a fire by the way [Music] how about let's go find a spot to sit down away from here and figure out uh oh god damn it ryan kicked it so i stopped the fall apologize to graham the audio editor sorry graeme i love you uh is really annoying me what is he such a ticket [Music] trying to feed me snacks snacks don't need your stupid snacks you sorry i can't hear you you have to speak up i'm talking to you talking to ground brian how did we miss the polar bear we could have been a polar but then you'd have to be on all fours for five minutes and maybe on a roof too where do you think we are sam what's your i wanna i wanna hear a what do you think should we tell them oh we have to tell them oh i guess you're correct you uh you kind of screwed us this morning no you didn't a little bit because we were you don't get to tell them what we were doing okay fine no that's just that's giving away info that they don't need so where were you where are you all going now uh we couldn't possibly say i'm actually gonna hang up because i'm worried that the person is going to announce where we are going um so i am hanging up wait one second um so that's actually a useful intel they're in the airport is the camera recording yes okay so they're in there they're in the airport and presumably i'm zoomed in though third time i mean we should keep that in mind so they're in the airport and leaving presumably pretty soon if he's worried that there i have my own if if if they're worried that they're about to announce it so we should check the departure board i think brian might be losing it okay our flight is boarding so we gotta talk quick sam just claimed idaho which is exactly what we were hoping was gonna happen which means that he did go to phoenix and get the video of us while he was in the air i can't wait to watch his reaction to that oh my god so and the fact that he has idaho means that it's really really good that we're going the place that we are about to go let's just say it's about to get hairy up north um i'm feeling amazing about the decisions that we have made quite frankly we'll see you soon okay so let's start by checking which flights they could reasonably on reasonably beyond so salem i mean it looked like they were at a pretty big airport so i'm assuming they didn't go to like a regional airport like eugene or something yeah okay so portland okay so let's go down the list of the ones that they could feasibly be on in the next hour yeah los angeles salt lake city minneapolis tucson seattle san diego dallas los angeles new york seattle among those i'm guessing that they're connecting through somewhere and dallas that's a big connecting hub but they would get into late unless they just like overnighted there um minneapolis i think similar deal yeah they were getting at 7 pm i don't think they could connect and get anywhere useful um salt lake city it gets in at 421 so they could possibly get somewhere useful um [Music] the only thing that matters right now is montana montana is our only winning unless they figured out that like it's going to take us a minute to get montana and are just going to like speed new mexico texas across tomorrow or something but i don't think they would win that i feel like with this departure board unless they somehow had some seattle connection and i didn't see any um useful flights from seattle to the montana airports i'm gonna guess it's this they're going through salt lake city at 1 35. so let's check let's check connections through salt lake city okay so they could not get to bozeman through salt lake city check helena [Music] they could get they could connect to butte burt mooney airport which is like this tiny it's in butte montana which is tiny i'm tiny airport but it's nearby it's like within salt lake yeah let's check missoula [Music] they couldn't make missoula um okay so that butte burt mooney airport that would be a problem arriving at 6 57 p.m so plenty of time for them to get in a hotel [Music] okay that would be i mean they've historically not been very good at like looking for alternate airports but i feel like they might have learned oh yeah so look at that they're still leaving seats available on that itinerary 405 bucks oh that's where's that coming from that's going from portland to salt lake city salt lake city to bert mooney airport oh damn it there are rental cars available from butte montana oh we might have just been uh vested a bit what time does the that flight leave up 135 it's like the timing or the flight sullivan was at 135 well what time does it leave salt lake is there any reason we couldn't get to salt lake and get that flight i mean their flight to salt lake city is leaving in like 20 minutes so yeah i know but that means we should check sure but don't even want that matter is if we can get on it then it's just a straight race oh wait a minute because there are flights to salt lake city city from here [Music] oh wait we can okay let's do it oh okay we need to get to the airport uh 3 46 so it's leaves in an hour and a half i was just assuming that we couldn't i guess we're geographically closer so if you have leaves later oh man that would be okay i i did not think we were gonna get to montana tonight still a big if that would be hilarious if we both ended up on that random ass flight oh how uh what if i told you that we woke up and ran out today how surprising is that we're not even close to done [Music] hi all right we've just landed in salt lake city utah which would be a really great state for us to claim but actually we are not going to claim it nope we have a connection to a flight that will get us somewhere that we think is actually a much better plate in utah what is it you'll find out [Music] and yours you're good i feel amazing thank you i'm kind of excited [Music] i mean we missed the first bus there's a chance they were on the first bus we couldn't see them through the window when it was pulling alive [Music] once we get airborne a flight time should be roughly 50 minutes oh man what a cliffhanger well guess what you can watch the final episode of connect 4 right now on nebula the streaming service i started with my other creator friends once you

are the 22 West of the Mississippi not Alaska and Hawaii cuz they're too far and not the East Coast ones cuz they're too janky and small and weird how we claim the state is we go to the actual state capital building and randomly draw a card from this deck on each card is a challenge we complete that challenge we claim the state once we have four states that can be connected either perfectly vertically or perfectly horizontally we win the teams are myself and Brian for real engineering and Ben and Adam who are not famous so they don't get to talk the game at a Chicago O'Hare Hilton and that means we have to get up at 4:00 a.m. so cut to us the most excited and energized we've ever been now what if I just turn off this is like the world's crappiest New Year's party wait wait it's about to happen here we go oh bye bye I hope you miss your flight all right strategy time yeah what do we do now all right Brian we got to figure out how where to go where are we going well we got to decide we're going to find out yeah so here I mean here's the deal right we've looked over the map there you know one big conclusion is like all states are definitely not created equal and we think the strongest two states are California and Nevada right we designed this game so we have had a lot of time to think about what the best potential first move is probably the most valuable combination is if you get California and Nevada that's really good Sam is probably in the other room right now talking your head off about that he's probably like oh Nevada Nevada every got to go to Nevada you have California and Nevada you can go up and claim Oregon and Washington or Oregon and Idaho due to this little weird border thing here or Idaho in Montana if you go east you can claim Utah Colorado Utah Wyoming Arizona and Mexico you have so many different options if you've claimed California and Nevada the problem is Ben and Adam probably also know that right but that's like half the reason we want to go there as well is like just not getting it is not an option okay we actually don't think that it makes sense to go to California and Nevada first and the reason is just that there aren't any good flights there the only way to get there is through connections early in the day there aren't any direct flight until late in the day yeah so let's let's check out the flights I would say that the most likely scenario is that they get on that nonstop to Sacramento that leaves quite late right it leaves at 9:00 a.m. doesn't get there till noon if we go to San Francisco we get there at 9:30 it's an hour and a half drive maybe 30 minutes to a rental car so we can get to Sacramento by 11:30 start claiming it before they even land right we can get a 6:00 a.m. flight to Denver and get there at 7:45 we would have landed in Denver they would still in the air the cool thing about Denver is that it's actually near Cheyenne Wyoming and so you can drive there claim Cheyenne and those are going to be really valuable I think later in the game because what I anticipate happening is that the whole west side of the board gets all like mixed up and stuff after a while and then we go to the East and then we'll have an advantage because we'll have eastern states and they won't but we really got to go yeah we got we got to go I mean I I don't really see a better move than this I mean I just can't think of any better move for than this to get California Nevada should we go ahead and book it then I think so we've done it Brian excited let's go to San Francisco I can't wait to spend three days with you s you got to hurry though if the security is bad we're [Music] screwed I'm coming with [Music] you it won't let me get my boarding pass so we got to run to the gate agent it won't let me get my boarding pass uh can is your ID please yeah feels like Christmas Sam Happy Christmas it's March thank you okay we're going to be fine all right Brian we got to sneak up to the gate okay in case they're there I don't see them I don't it's a good sign we're at the gate and consensus is that they're not here there you go have a good day thank [Music] you let me to stop the traic all right buddy we got to go go go we all right we're about to finally walk out into a the soon to be claimed state of Colorado our state there's our boy all right go ahead I think it looks like it's five well that ended up costing way more than we thought it would all right we got the rental car it ended up costing a million dollar because I accidentally booked it for March 10th instead of for today and they were not happy about that we're off to a bit of a rocky start here we go on our way to Victor Cheyenne I think Cheyenne yeah so if you're wondering why Ben and Adam are driving to Cheyenne Wyoming instead of claiming Denver Colorado where they just flew in let me explain basically they're messing with me right now I have no idea where they are and the way the rules work I'll only find out where they are once they claim their first date so they decided to do The Annoying Thing and drive to Cheyenne the capital Wyoming which will take two hours an extra two in which I don't know where they are then they'll go claim Denver because they have to get back to Denver International Airport anyways to get their next flight all right we are about halfway to Cheyenne we're going to be cutting things a little close we're trying to make a flight by 400 p.m and if Sam is doing what we think he's doing this move will really screw him so fingers crossed that this works [Music] out what what my God what is that what what is it's very giant come on how long is this thing this is this is fast oh no all right all right I'm going a different way all right rerouting reroute us Adam okay all right Adam tell the audience are in where we are the capital of the great state of Wyoming Cheyenne Wyoming and this right here is the capital building it's got a big weird golden dome over it but I'm pretty into it it's quite cool I think we'll give it five out of seven American flag O five out of seven I agree I have the cards we have not looked at them oh I'm so nervous I'm going to like throw up oh god there are so many cards that I don't want to pull okay I'm doing a shuffle then take one okay oh God all right this one we're going to take this one okay okay okay what is it what is it this card is catch three different local bugs catch we're doing the bug card baby let's go let's go I will be honest I'm not seeing a lot of bugs I'm not seeing a lot of bugs I just saw bugs zip past you did that confirms that there are bugs in Wyoming maybe we should drive somewhere drive somewhere that's going to have more bugs is there like a body of water like a body of water with I'll try and spot bugs out the window I really don't want us to spend a long time trying to catch the bugs there are birds birds might have bugs you want us to go manhandle a goose all right this feels like a much buggier area you getting strong bug vibes from here I'm getting huge bug Vibes over here keep your eyes peeled there's got to be bugs around here no bugs no bugs no bugs we have to catch three bugs and we have not really even seen one bug oh oh no that's just debris is it too [Music] cold why are there not any bugs I mean not even like an ant I'm Googling how to find bugs under wood like with trees potentially let's go to the other side although I'm feeling pretty disheartened about the bugs [Music] US Post Office ready to go s let's let's let's go do the thing Brian California state capital building oh we have to go to the capital building yep proceed to the rers I thought we could just go anywhere in the city no got to go to the capital building read the rules Brian [Music] come on this is like I feel like I'm going insane should be bug Central right here I got a bug baby I got a bug you got a bug you got a bug we got to get it on camera where is it what is it oh yeah that's a bug that's a bug that's a freaking bug look you can see it you see it crawling around in there there's a bug in there maybe you can't see it but there's a there's a bug in there and we have one bug oh I have a different bug different bug okay that's a different bug for sure that's two bugs my friend that is two bugs my friend we're two bugs up one bug to go let's go oh is that a that's an ant but we don't have an ant Adam get that ant I can force it under my finger that is an ant I I really want to make sure people can see if you look in here get a really good look there are two bugs in there this is the third bug we have all three bugs at the same time that's three bugs we did it baby we got three bugs three bugs three bugs three bugs in wyg time call Sam Baby Ben and Adam tried calling us to tell us they' claimed Wyoming but we were busy getting ripped off at the rental car place so they sent a video instead okay so we just got a video from Ben and Adam I'm going to play it while still looking at the road because I'm driving and respect the laws it's still in the air meanwhile while you were doing that we were busy claiming the first state of the game the great state of Wilding check it out look at that that's our state cowboy state actually don't know is the cowboy state I have no idea sounds right I'm going to put up on the screen what it is cowboy state baby it's our let's go okay well that's interesting uh I like those guys don't say that Brian okay so Wyoming's an interesting first choice I don't even like honestly I don't already know where Wyoming is I know it's north of Denver so I figured like I where would they fly into Wyoming they would fly to Denver and Drive North so they'd have to probably go back to Denver I mean good news is they're nowhere near us and we're almost certain to get California and Nevada now unless they like aerate here I'm hoping that when they see that we're in California they're going to panic and like fly directly west because they know how good of a combo California Nevada we have so many choices the problem though is I think that we just going to get three states before we get [Music] two here we are at the Colorado state capital what would we rate this Adam I mean it's quite nice I give it a a a 53 out of seven American flags 5.3 out of seven American flags that seems about right to me so still no word from Sam but we are about to get our second state so you better hurry up pick a card make it a good one please get one team member intoxicated you may get intoxicated at any bar in the states yeah baby Ben's getting drunk let's go I have to drive so Ben's getting drunk let's go all right let's find a bar walk I'm assuming we can walk to a bar got to look it up very quickly eat something because we have not eaten today we haven't eaten anything and you're about to take four straight shots I am a huge lightweight welcome to Denver's best dive bar I need to get four shots of vodka unfortunately got to down all four of those shots right yeah he does we're here in a very cool Dive Bar very cool um and Ben's about to get absolutely smashed okay you can do it there's one great job oh poison thank you very much I'm getting a lot of support number two perfect thanks very much you the viewer would have no way of knowing this but Ben like doesn't really drink a lot um like this will be by far the most I've ever seen him drink took a little break to uh reflect on my career shot number three you're doing it you're doing it take a minute there's it like I've definitely never had this much alcohol in my entire life what's going to happen the rest of the day what time is it 12:30 it's 12:30 it's only been 20 minutes and I'm going to down this last shot in a second number four [Music] oh I am now officially drunk in Colorado so that means it's time to call Sam and Bri that means it's time to call Sam and Brian what's up what's up oh you're in a owners of this great state of Colorado wait that's my state we don't even have one state yet Sam were we supposed to where is going to Chick-fil-A only certain states have Chick-fil-A that's true you went California ksas probably has chick has chick-fil I mean we're starting to to get nervous for you guys well I am too here's a question for you are you feeling better or worse than you were at the beginning of the morning uh in a way better in a way worse does that that does that make sense no I don't know it doesn't at all at all that might make more sense when once you've uh once you know where we are all right where are we Brian where is it nice job welcome to Sacramento do bit of split in the deck oh this is a lot of pressure it's magic we doing magic in a par kick one anyone is it the one I I oh no eat spicy food okay well we got to find a local Indian restaurant should we go back the car and research yes all [Music] right I'm so drunk the uh this is so bad the alcohol is really setting in for Ben we need to get him some food and some water as soon as possible here's going to be my strategy for TSA I'm going to do that and then I'm not even going to talk and they're not going to know that I'm drunk is it is it not allowed to go to the airport drunk I'm not sure is it not loud this is hot ones the show with hot questions and even hotter wings so we have to say verbatim I want the spiciest thing on the menu look like the spiciest thing you have one uh sure yeah and it turns out that basically all their spices in the sauce so they just gave us this little tiny thing of sauce that's supposed to be their spiciest sauce but that's what they suggested was the spiciest thing so we follow the rules so are you going to chug it no I won't chug that I think we just have to finish the sauce so how about you pour the sauce on the two samosas okay I made a mistake oh the chick are oh that is hot oh okay okay I think Brian definitely has I don't like spicy stuff we can get out of here by on less than an hour in Sacramento oh God that's hot oh oh okay was a little bit dry more full I'm handling this way worse than Brian I actually have like hot one style like some tears coming out but Brian's like completely fine cuz Brian lived in Malaysia for a bunch of years right all right I'm done Brian's basically done oh Brian's done we did it oh should we call the call the kids [Music] what tell me where you are eh take a guess you're in California yep I wish you were somewhere else I'll be frank well have fun in uh in Carson St y see you there I'm going to wait I'm sending Adam I'm setting myself the boarding pass cuz Ben is really drunk do you want to tell the people what's happening we're eating hi so we're at Denver Airport we have a little bit of time before our flight um we are required under the rules to eat one real meal a day um because if you don't put that in the rules a lot of times it won't happen um and our real meal is uh some classic uh this is awesome hours 35 minutes that's not bad do you want to go the interstate route that takes us over Doner pass or the Tahoe it's kind of the same yeah let's do the Tahoe one this one more off the Beaten Track it's only 3 minutes longer we can spare that yeah this is [Music] easy look at those gas prices oh man I didn't even think about that actually no we'll gas up in Nevada where gas prices will be lower it's all the taxes that raise it here anyway um so livs can't say that Brian look views look uh Wildfire or is that beetle kill dead trees I think that's Beetle K be what's that it's like the beetle that's infesting a lot of forests in the US and killing a bunch of trees that doesn't look like wildfire and it doesn't look like walking godamn beetles premium gasing Biden oh my God that was a joke you have to say it's a joke no the president doesn't control right our G section is going to be terrible it's fine by the time this goes out all the world's problems will have been solved right we should have voted Putin and we can't say that I think these trees are pretty resilient yeah so what you're saying is like wildfires are natural and climate change doesn't exist what I'm saying is that wildfires are natural and therefore we should let wildfires that don't threaten human infrastructure burn but the extent and frequency of wildfires especially in the context of once in Millennium brouts is exceptional [Music] look it is welcome to Carson City Nevada all right where are we son we are hopefully at the Nevada state capital Sam you're not allowed in that was a good joke Brian we're here in Nevada welcome to Nevada here's the capital Carson City yourself tell us who you are I'm they already know I'm Sam okay Shuffle Brian this is a very important PLL actually this makes her break whether we can make a flight tonight all right you ready mhm I'm nervous I'm worried full of strike oh that's not that's not that bad that's actually fun can we find a bowling alley though let's find a bowling Alle pretty good at bowling yeah 6 minute drive and it's 10 to 4 man I think we gotten really lucky with the cars between Indian food and this this isn't bad yeah all well let's go [Music] bowling see what happen Sam oh they I guess it was like all the lanes were used by it looked like legit Bowlers anyway there's another one nearby I think it's just that's not great for timing so you know probably going to be staying in Reno tonight very possibly there is a chance there's a decent chance I think that Ben and Adam would have uh would have uh Gone on a flight to here we don't think they could have gotten here by now but we didn't look that closely and you never know um so yeah we're we're beining it to the closest lane and then it's all going to be on Brian to get that strike quickly because uh I not a good bowler um I'll give it a shot I usually get at least one strike per game yeah but that does unfortunately make it a lot less likely that we'll be able to catch a flight tonight at a Reno and get to a hotel by 9:30 so that puts us in a little bit of a worse situation for tomorrow but again we're about to have Nevada and California which are s such an OP pair we're going to be fine right cut to us not being fine same is there's no way he can win we're pretty sure that he has really really limited options out of um Reno and if he does what we think that he's going to do which is basically his only good option um we're about to do something that's going to absolutely ruin him um we're literally so good at this game it's crazy Sam sucks at this game he was so cocky about how quickly he was going to win the game and he's completely screwed now [Music] ladies and [Music] gent thank you cool that's [Music] bad I my oh if you get this nice second go all right I know you couldn't see the strike but I promise it's real if you pause right here see no pins strike [Music] all right Ben we have a new video from Sam B hey Adam oh they got the bowling alley one I wanted to do that one we did the thing we're in Nevada we got it on the second shot anyway hope you guys are doing well two states FL Nevada we're having a nice relaxing evening play some bowling all right see you later they got lucky lucky all right I get the idea it doesn't matter we knew they were going to do that and we're going to be fine it's all part of our plan this is actually our third America Sam this is our third time at the Eagle but the second time Brian did that whole bit but he actually dally took a photo instead of a video it's a good photo Brian your mic's upside down we've been up for a long time okay so we haven't really discussed like what state we want to do next right so North our choice would be uh Idaho Oregon and Washington we need two of those three and we can't do we can't do Idaho Washington because that's not a straight vertical line we could only do like Oregon Idaho or Oregon Washington uh the other choice would be go east but I don't think Utah is useful because because they have Colorado so I'm pretty sure that's a clean block so we couldn't get four that way so if we get wi East it would be Arizona and New Mexico we don't know where they're going but considering they have Wyoming Colorado they might be going to Santa Fe but I would guess that they would be there by now hi and I'm feeling they're going to be trying to block us I think they will and I think they're going to go to Idaho if they go for Idaho then we we want what do we want we want Oregon yeah that will but then they could just block us in Washington but then in the process of them going to Washington we could go down to New Mexico and go and get the EAS r at that point why why wouldn't we just go immediately to the east route oh man there's so many variables right now this is when this gets hard today has felt like a cakewalk uh huh okay so perfect there's a 6 AM to Phoenix $23 that's not bad airus A320 Airbus scare buus okay so like we could get to Phoenix that would work it ain't boing I ain't going exactly okay so the first flight into Santa Fe gets us an 11 uh 11:19 a.m. 250 bucks that's not bad either it's a direct flight from Phoenix right right so that's through Phoenix so that's not bad if we wanted to jump a state and block them in case that they went to like Montana tonight thank you very thank very much I'm I'm assuming I think that there's a really good shot there in Boise and are just smart enough to know that you know not to answer the phone yeah my only fear is like if they manag to block off all the Eastern things and then we're in the East like if they have Phoenix we're kind of blocked off a little bit yeah it would be really bad if they got Arizona that's right we're in Arizona the Grand Canyon State baby well
