On January 1st, 2014, I uploaded the first ""Things You Might Not Know"" video. Once the initial rush of videos settled down, I aimed for one video a week, and while there have sometimes been guest videos and occasional blatant filler: to my own satisfaction, I never missed a week. But now, it's time to stop.

I never got to space. I never got to the ocean depths. And I never got to fly off into the sunset, harnessed underneath a helicopter. I couldn't find an excuse for that one.

The Extremely Large Telescope, in Paranal, Chile, is probably going to be the largest optical telescope that will ever be constructed.

This is the most uncomfortable I've ever felt while filming, for a few reasons. First, of course, because of the locust swarm itself. Second, because animal research ‚Äî even on creatures as simple and pestilent as locusts ‚Äî always raises ethical questions. Now, the researchers are careful with the locusts, and I don't think many people could have a problem with this. Indeed, most of the world currently has zero ethical restrictions on insect experimentation ‚Äî but it's still worth interrogating whether this is okay. And finally: because if we can do this so easily to less intelligent creatures... what's to stop something more intelligent coming along and doing the same to us?

2022-04-18T15:00:02Z,The bridge that must legally wobble,"""Daly's Bridge"", in Cork, Ireland, is better known as the Shakey Bridge. Because it shakes. But what happens when a bridge like that has to be repaired and refurbished? ‚Ä¢ Thanks to Cllr McCarthy: his site is http://corkheritage.ie/ !

Edited by Dave Stevenson http://davestevenson.co.uk

A thorough study of how the Bridge shakes: http://publish.ucc.ie/boolean/pdf/2015/00/32-ODonnell-2015-00-en.pdf [PDF]

I did try (a lot!) to get an interview with someone from RPS Group, who were in charge of the refurbishment, but I just wasn't able to make contact. However, I'm indebted to Michael Minehane, principal engineer, whose talk to Engineers Ireland gives a lot of in-depth information about the bridge was refurbished! You can watch it here, along with Cllr McCarthy's history of the bridge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j52poh2ZfSA

Thanks to Youssuf Radwan for the suggestion!

I haven't been able to do VPN advertising for a long time. Well, this one time, I don't have to: because the robot double's going to do it for me.

With many thanks to all the team at Engineered Arts who worked on this. To be clear, this is not sponsored by them, I paid money (technically, NordVPN's money) for the Mesmer robot -- or at least, for the silicone mask and 3D printed skull that were put together for just one day!

Thanks to all the team at Gatwick Airport! (To be clear, this isn't a sponsored video: I approached them about filming this, and I'm grateful for the access. I did not expect to get out on the airfield.)

Bonus fact for pulling down the description: this was filmed on Wednesday, when the cloud of Saharan dust was in the atmosphere. I had to do a lot of colour-correction to make the outside scenes look normal!

FICTION RECOMMENDATIONS, all FREELY AVAILABLE ONLINE:

ACCELERANDO by Charles Stross (2010): novel created from short stories. https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html
Arguably the peak of late-noughties singularity fiction, a fad for the ""rapture of the nerds"" that's mostly passed now. It's still worth a read, even if its early sections are already feeling a little dated: 

BIT PLAYERS by Greg Egan (2014): short story. https://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/winter_2014/bit_players_by_greg_egan
Part one of a trilogy that continues in 3-Adica and Instantiation, available in this short story collection: https://amzn.to/3tLn1dO [that's an Amazon affiliate link]

EVERYONE IN SILICO by Jim Munroe (2004): novel. https://jimmunroe.net/writing/free_ebook_released.html
A book from the peak era of Adbusters, talking about corporate-sponsored mind-uploading, the author tried to invoice a load of brands for the entirely-uninvited ""product placement"".

LENA by qntm (2021): short story. https://qntm.org/mmacevedo
Terrifying Wikipedia article from the future. And while it's technically about uploading, it's also not about uploading: https://qntm.org/uploading

2021-11-22T16:00:25Z,The tunnel where people pay to inhale radioactive gas,"In most of the world, inhaling radon for pain relief sounds like a bizarre idea. In some places, though, it's so accepted that it's prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance. And I have no idea how to talk about it. Thanks to the team at the Radonstollen in Bad Kreuznach: you can find out more about them at https://acuradon.de

SOURCES:
The paper I reference in the video is ""Radon Exposure‚ÄîTherapeutic Effect and Cancer Risk"" by Maier et al, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22010316 ‚Äî it is, as far as I can tell, the most comprehensive analysis of all the studies so far, and I recommend reading not just the paper but also the extensive bibliography. As mentioned in the video, they claim no conflict of interest but some of the funding does ultimately come from the radon therapy industry.

There are a LOT of papers about this, and about radiation hormesis. A Google Scholar search will rapidly send you down a rabbit hole of ""this seems like it works"" papers, followed by ""this study had a very small sample size"" or ""this study had flaws"" meta-analysis. I am not qualified to analyse their quality and conflicts of interest, so in this case, departing from my usual policy, I'm leaving that exploration as an exercise for the reader!

2021-09-13T15:00:09Z,Three strange river crossings,"Over the Manchester Ship Canal, you'll find the Hulmes Ferry, the Thelwall Ferry, and the Warburton Toll Bridge. They're all strange in their own way, all under the control of one company, and all dating back to old laws and legal documents from a hundred years ago. I was in the area, so I stopped by, and found that things might be changing soon.

REFERENCES:
Manchester Ship Canal Act (1885)
Rixton and Warburton Bridge Act (1863)
(NOTE: it looks like permission for the toll bridge was set up by the 1863 Act, but that was a different bridge over the River Mersey, and the laws and permissions were transferred over to the Ship Canal when they needed a bigger bridge and it is a complete mess of legal wrangling. As it doesn't affect the final story, I quietly elided that whole section because it was far too dull!)

2021-05-31T15:00:20Z,The Accidental Rush for Anthrax Island,"Gruinard Island, in the north-west of Scotland, was where Britain tested its biological weapons. That story's been told many times: but I found something in the archives that I don't think anyone's ever noticed before.

Thanks to the boat crew and voice artists!
Location fixer: Vikki McCraw at Locations 365 http://www.locations365.co.uk/

SOURCES from the National Archives:
WO 188/2783
WO 188/3169
WO 32/20442
DEFE 55/118
DEFE 68/991, 992, 993

One other stories I found but couldn't fit into the video: the government spent a long time trying to work out the legal ramifications of selling the island back. In the end, they agreed to guarantee the cleanup for 150 years, which to me is the strongest evidence that there's nothing dangerous left there: they wouldn't have taken that risk otherwise!

Dead Horse Bay served as an unofficial dump for decades, and now as the sand is washed away the boroughs' history is slowly being revealed, one china plate and glass bottle at a time. It's popular with local archeologists (both ameteur ""treasure hunters"" and professionals) as they wade through New York City's past. 
 
But this year, a darker side of the city's history has emerged: traces of radon gas and gamma radiation exceeding ambient levels. As parts of the beach have been closed off, locals are worried: will their artifacts and their history now just wash out to sea? And when trash becomes treasured, do we have a responsibility to preserve it?

Is it true? And if so: why? I ate a few bagels, and set out to flunk an opioid test.

üëáüëáüëá SOURCES and REFERENCES üëáüëáüëá
Drug tests don‚Äôt just work as a buzzkill, they can keep doctors and patients honest regarding some of the more dangerous drugs known to man. The problem is, poppy seeds can throw a giant wrench in that circle of trust! Poppy seeds come from the papaver somniferum flower native to Turkey, and even though they don‚Äôt contain opium, consuming the seeds has historically caused the tests to register opiate use!

In this video, I explore how these tests work, what they look for, and how something as simple as a bottle of seeds available at any grocery store, can cause a false positive for painkillers, heroin, morphine, and other drugs.

Encyclopedia Britannica: Poppy Seed
https://www.britannica.com/topic/poppy-seed
https://www.britannica.com/story/can-eating-poppy-seeds-make-you-fail-a-drug-test 
Poppy seed, tiny dried seed of the opium poppy, used as food, food flavouring, and the source of poppy-seed oil. Poppy seeds have no narcotic properties, because the fluid contained in the bud that becomes opium is present only before the seeds are fully formed. The plant, Papaver somniferum, is an herbaceous annual native to Greece and the Orient. Poppy seed is an ancient spice; the seed capsules have been found in Switzerland in the remains of prehistoric lake dwellings.

Can Eating Poppy Seeds Give You a Positive Drug Test?
https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-nutrition/poppy-seeds-drug-test#bottom-line
It‚Äôs possible that even just one bagel or muffin highly loaded with poppy seeds can lead to a positive urine drug test.

2020-11-09T16:00:20Z,Five Things You Can't Do On British Television,"Pull down this description for information on all the shows I mention, plus all my references, and some advice if you're looking to subtitle your videos!

üî§üî§ SUBTITLES üî§üî§

15% of my viewers watch with subtitles! They're helpful for folks without headphones, or in loud environments, or who can't hear well, or who just like subtitles. More people will watch if subtitles are an option.

Before 2020, YouTube had a volunteer community-captions system. Alas, due to spam (and, I suspect, the difficulty of porting it to the new Studio), YouTube turned it off. So your options are:

OPTION 1: DO IT YOURSELF

If your video is one or two people talking, you can add subtitles easily with YouTube's tools: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796 - that's also possible for more complex videos, but it can be time-consuming.

OPTION 2: PAY A SMALL AMOUNT

If you can afford an editor, you can afford subtitles! They only cost $1-2 per minute of audio.

For simple audio, try Rev: https://www.rev.com/blog/coupon/?ref=tomscott To be clear, that's an affiliate link: you get $10 of captions free (enough for up to an 8-minute video), and I get a kickback from them. However, my opinions of Rev are mixed. They have downsides, and they may not be the right option for you!

Advantages of Rev:
‚úÖ Extremely fast turnaround
‚úÖ Easy, simple, automated, self-service
‚úÖ Reasonable price

Disadvantages of Rev:
üö´ Rev is a gig-economy company, with everything that entails. In 2019, transcribers raised issues including low pay. https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20979249/rev-recordings-transcriptions-low-pay-complaints-freelance-transcribers
üö´ Accuracy is usually acceptable for clear speech, but not the near-perfect results you'd expect from a more high-end subtitle company.
üö´ They're limited to their simple, narrow, house style. That isn't ideal for videos with long sentences or many speakers.

For more complicated audio or for multiple speakers, try Caption+: https://caption.plus -- a small company that produces extremely high-quality subtitles for a reasonable price.

Advantages of Caption+:
‚úÖ Exceptional subtitle accuracy.
‚úÖ Hand-tweaked broadcast-standard subtitles that are perfect for accessibility, and which the audience love.
‚úÖ Can use positioning and per-speaker colors, and match other style requests.
‚úÖ Still a reasonable price.

Disadvantages of Caption+:
üö´ Not automated: you're dealing with a human by email, and paying invoices.

OTHER COMPANIES: I also used 3PlayMedia once, but unfortunately can't recommend them based on that experience. YouTube also mention ceilo24 and Amara, neither of which I have experience with: https://cielo24.com/ https://amara.org/

üì∫üì∫ SHOWS üì∫üì∫

Here's a list of all the shows mentioned, with links where available. (Where Amazon links are listed, those are affiliate links, where I earn a commission from sales.)

The Demon Headmaster is available on DVD from Amazon UK: https://amzn.to/37Cb68U - and the 2019 revival is available in the UK on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m0009f6n/the-demon-headmaster

Derren Brown: The Events: How To Control The Nation is available for free on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyIilWb9SW0 - although it lacks the live broadcast cut-ins.

The pilot episode of Crisis Command: Could You Run The Country? has been uploaded to YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkSeuD-8yA - normally I wouldn't link to an unofficial upload, but the series will likely never be repeated or see a commercial release.

Ghostwatch is available on DVD from Amazon UK: https://amzn.to/3kweAgL - I should absolutely have put the ghost in the background of one of my shots here, I regret missing that joke!

The full Ghostwatch continuity announcement is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDSZWpp_Rhw

Who Wants To Be A Millionaire have an entire YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/c/MillionaireUK/videos - and yes, Jeremy Clarkson is the host now, I suspect that'll surprise a lot of people.

But in these very limited circumstances, at Iceland's Blue Lagoon, you can swim in geothermal power plant wastewater, and it's even healthy: although the marketing material doesn't usually mention it.

So instead, here's the difference between a million and a billion, in a more one-dimensional way: distance.

FAQ:
Q: Is this accurate?
A: Yes. The GPS track on the GoPro wasn't great, though, so the walking sections had to be manually smoothed out. For the main car drive, I relied on a backup GPS tracker taking a sample every 1 second. That data was loaded into an After Effects expression, set to $1 per 0.1093mm. If it couldn't pick up a GPS reading (for example, in the Chestfield Tunnel), it waited until signal returned and then calculated an average speed for the gap. There was one correction: during a stop next to a large lorry, the GPS lost tracking and wandered about 50m in a random pattern while the car was completely at a halt. Those errors were removed.

Q: Why is this in 50fps?
A: The electricity grid in the UK runs at 50Hz, which means that you can get strobing effects from lighting. Normally that wouldn't matter on something filmed outside, and I'd go with 60fps, but I didn't want to risk full-screen strobing in the tunnel section. (You do still see strobing on some variable message signs, but that's for different technical reasons.) As 24/25fps feels too slow and jerky for a continuous dashcam shot, this was the best option. 

Q: Why did you do this with American dollars in the UK?
A: The Bank of England doesn't produce a ¬£1 note. The smallest paper money we have is ¬£5. (The Royal Bank of Scotland, and the banks of some of the Channel Islands, do though!) And while it would have been apt to do this along desert roads in California, sometimes you've got to make do with what's available.

Q: What was that ""oops"" about a minute into the drive?
A: I nearly turned left one junction too soon, which would have sent me to a closed barrier and ruined the take.

Q: Why do you change lanes so much?
A: In the UK, the ""correct"" thing to do is to always switch to the leftmost possible lane after overtaking on a motorway, unless there's another car you'll have to overtake soon or you're approaching a slip road. This means you have to change lanes a lot more than in many other countries. Source: https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/advice/driving-advice/middle-lane-hogging/

Q: You pass a van on the left at one point. Is that legal?
A: Deliberately passing on the left (""undertaking"") in the UK is considered dangerous driving on non-motorways and in free-flowing motorway traffic. However, in congestion when traffic is slowed down, keeping up with traffic in your lane is fine. Source: https://www.askthe.police.uk/content/Q891.htm

Q: What do those white signs with a black stripe mean?
A: ""National speed limit applies"". On dual carriageways (""divided highways""), that means 70mph; on other roads, it's lower. Alas, it does not mean ""no speed limit"" like it does on the German autobahn.

Q: What do the signs with the white C in a red circle mean?
A: Those are reminders about the Dart Charge, the ¬£2.50 toll for crossing the Thames at Dartford.

Q: How many attempts did this take?
A: Three. Attempt one was ruined by the time of day: I was travelling east in the morning -- so all the camera could see was glare from the sun and the dashboard reflected in the windscreen. Attempt two was ruined by the camera overheating shortly after the Dartford Crossing. (That's why this is in 2.7k, not 4k, and why you can hear wind noise from the air conditioning blowing over the camera to keep it cool.)

Q: How can this be an FAQ when you wrote it before the video went live?
A: In this case, ""FAQ"" stands for ""Fully Anticipated Questions"".

2020-01-27T16:00:04Z,The bridge that's in two countries at the same time,"Schengen is a small town in Luxembourg, on the borders with France and Germany. But one of those borders is a little more complicated: the Mosel (or Moselle) river is a condominium, it belongs to both countries at the same time. And thus, so the bridges above it.

REFERENCES:
I'm not 100% happy with the research in this video, because it was put together quickly and, through necessity of language, from English-speaking secondary sources. However, Frank Jacobs in the New York Times on condominiums, talks about the history of the treaties: https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/the-worlds-most-exclusive-condominium/
and that's confirmed by a reference in Freshwater Boundaries Revisited: Recent Developments in International River Law by Mar√≠a Querol, which quotes Bernhardt's Encyclopedia of Public International Law, Vol 111, p465.

Interestingly, the borders on Google Maps, Bing Maps and OpenStreetMap all take different (and sometimes nonsensical) twists and turns, so I've chosen to illustrate the simplest example.

2019-03-11T16:00:04Z,The Last Play-For-Cash Fascination Parlor,"UPDATE: In 2019, the Fascination Parlor was hit by storms, and the building didn't survive. The games have been stored, and hopefully it'll reopen somewhere at some point! ‚Ä¢ On Nantasket Beach in the seaside town of Hull, Massachusetts, sits the last play-for-cash Fascination Parlor in the world. It's a century-old arcade game, made of relays that click and buzz. There are a few other parlors left in the world: but this is the only one where you're playing for actual money.

2019-03-04T16:00:01Z,The broken building that must not be destroyed,"St Peter's Seminary sits in woodland about an hour west of Glasgow, near a village called Cardross. If you like Brutalist architecture, then it's a beautiful ruin: if not, then perhaps your view isn't so kind. It's a historic, religious building: but it's also a money sink that can't be demolished.

My thanks to Ronnie Convery at the Archdiocese of Glasgow!

We built a car that you drive with real-life video game lag, and used it for an ill-advised, mostly-unscientific experiment about motion sickness.

In case it wasn't obvious: we did this in a private area away from public roads and other traffic, and I insisted on more safety checks than William and Michael would normally have. Don't try this unless you're doing the same!

2019-02-04T16:00:05Z,How to slow down a stock exchange,"High-frequency traders have a few tactics on stock exchanges: but simply put, they gather price information faster than anyone else, sometimes even faster than the markets themselves, and use that to make a tiny profit many, many, many times. There are all sorts of solutions: but it turns out there's a simpler one that involves physics.

Thanks to Ronan and all the team at IEX - you can find out more about them here: https://iextrading.com/ or on Twitter at https://twitter.com/IEX

2018-09-24T15:00:02Z,Wingwalking used to be a lot more dangerous,"Back in the 1920s, wingwalking claimed lives. Daredevils would move around on the top of a plane's wings, in mid-flight, often without any harness or any safety line. Maybe they'd be able to clip onto something during takeoff and landing, but maybe not. There are still a few of those true daredevil wingwalkers out there in the world, but in the 21st century... it's usually a bit different.

Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond were better known as the KLF (or the Timelords, or the JAMs, or...). Their Manual is out of print, but I'm sure that won't stop enterprising people from tracking down versions of it, or footage of their burn.

The music for this series has been an instrumental version of ""Game of Taking Chances"" by Johannes Hager feat. Josefin Backrud, from Epidemic Sound

Once it was a productive gold mine, but after the gold ran out, the mining company went bankrupt and left the government to clean up the mess: enough arsenic trioxide dust to kill everyone on Earth. The solution: freezing it, at least for now.

Thanks to all the team at the Giant Mine Remediation Project! More about them: http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100027364/1100100027365

There's an error in this video: I say ""200,000 tonnes of gold"", but that's actually 200,000kg. The 200,000 tonne figure is for arsenic dust. You can see all corrections for this channel at https://www.tomscott.com/corrections/

2018-04-16T15:00:02Z,"G-force, jerk, and a giant centrifuge","Thanks to the Starrship team for arranging this! I'm also over on their channel, flying with the Blades: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWY3-1gOrxk ‚Ä¢ At the Royal Air Force training centrifuge in Farnborough, pilots learn how to avoid G-LOC: g-induced loss of consciousness. Let's talk about g-force, about jerk, and about how to keep circulation flowing to your brain.

FAQs:

* Isn't 3.6g a really low g-tolerance? *
Yep. Turns out I would not qualify to be a fighter pilot. The average range for g-tolerance is 4-6; no-one was expecting me to pass out. The centrifuge team do not deliberately try to G-LOC people! To be fair, though, I'd done a few earlier runs with only minor effects.

* What g was the RAF person at the start pulling? *
That's Marcus, from the Starrship team, and he was successfully pulling 6.5g with the help of g-trousers: they plug into a compressed air source in the plane (and in the centrifuge) and act as a lower-body tourniquet to keep the blood up top. They are very effective.

* Why did you shake and shudder when regaining consciousness? *
Those are called ""myoclonic convulsions"", which is a fancy medical term for ""muscle jerks"", and they're a common side effect of recovering from G-LOC.

* What did it feel like? *
I'll answer this in more detail in a video over on the Matt and Tom channel soon, but in short: I don't remember it. I was doing the breathing maneuver, then everything was wobbly, then we were stopped!

* Is this a sponsored video? *
No: the RAF and Starrship had no editorial control over this, and no money changed hands. Obviously, though, they gave me a spin in the centrifuge, and I'm collaborating with them over on their channel too!


THANKS TO:

It seemed like a really clever idea - but it was really hard to research. Or at least it was, until I stumbled upon one magic phrase that revealed its history.

It turns out this thing's called an ""Inogon leading mark"" or ""Inogon light"" -- Inogon, not Inogen -- and it's a Swedish invention from the 1980s. But there's still a question: why is being used to mark an undersea cable, instead of guiding people home?

(Full disclosure: there were some weird strobing effects from the light that only showed up when I got the footage into the edit, so the image you see here has been digitally stabilised so it appears the same way on screen as it does in person!)

Thanks to Andrew Stine for suggesting this!

Thanks to all the team at Wiechert'sche Erdbebenwarte G√∂ttingen! You can find out more about them here: https://www.erdbebenwarte.de/

Three things I had to cut out of this video, because they didn't quite fit into the story or because I couldn't film them:

The reason the steel ball survived two world wars is because the university's records listed it by use as a ""rock-ball"", not by composition as a ""steel ball"" - so no-one melted it down for weaponry.

The observatory team refill that pit every year to make the ground flat, and the ball just digs a hole again. The rock's just being compressed underneath. They joke that, somewhere in Australia, there's a slowly growing hill...

And finally, the ground steams for a little while after the ball hits: it gets rather warm...

Then the news broke about unethical faceswapping videos, and software designed and marketed for creating them: and I realised the future had arrived faster than I thought.

(This was originally a talk given at An Evening of Unnecessary Detail earlier this week, but I managed to mangle the audio recording settings, so I rerecorded it in a muddy park! It's not the same without the audience, but hopefully it's close enough.)

2017-12-11T16:00:01Z,This is how zero-g flights actually work,"The European Space Agency offered me a seat on their zero-g plane: it's an Airbus A310 that flies parabolic maneuvers, pulling up into the sky and then arcing back down, giving its passengers about 20 seconds of weightlessness (or ""microgravity"") at a time. Here's how it works.

Some people would have filmed their script on the ground, and just messed about while floating. I decided to go for something a bit more challenging.

**

If you're a masters or PhD student from an ESA member state, and zero-g sounds like your thing, have a look at the Fly Your Thesis program: http://www.esa.int/Education/Fly_Your_Thesis -- the 2017-18 submissions are closed, but that just gives you time to start planning for next year...

**

FAQs:

Why isn't Neil floating around the cabin in zero-g?: Sometimes, his feet are under a safety strap, so he doesn't drift away. Sometimes, he's holding on with one hand, and he's just that good at zero-g maneuvers.

Why's my face so red?: During the 1.8g phase, my heart has to work extra hard to pump blood up to my head -- when I switch to 0g, it takes a few seconds for it to slow pumping, so my blood pressure spikes.

What stabilised camera did I use?: You're looking at footage from a GoPro Fusion, stabilised in post using Adobe After Effects and the telemetry from the plane's sensors.

What did it feel like?: There'll be a behind-the-scenes video on the Matt and Tom channel on Saturday, hopefully!

But it was, here and in other towns across the United States. It might have sounded like a good idea on paper, but in practice, it had a few unfortunate problems... including occasional accidental amputations.

That was going to be the whole of my video... and then I did some more research.

Full disclosure: Thyssenkrupp paid for my travel to Germany, but that's all they did. I'd got in touch with them last year asking to see this when it opened; their PR firm replied, offering to fly me out. They had no editorial control over this, and didn't get to see it before it was uploaded!

2017-06-19T15:00:04Z,The Runways of Fire That Let WW2 Planes Land In Fog: FIDO,"Landing on a runway surrounded by fire might not sound like a good idea, but it's better than trying to land without modern instruments in thick fog. This was FIDO: ""Fog, Intensive, Dispersal Of"" (originally ""Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operations""), the Royal Air Force's strange but brilliant scheme that saved thousands of air crew lives.

Unlike a lot of World War 2 experiments, this one not only worked, but was deployed around the country. It would have been used in peacetime, too, except for one rather big problem: petrol's really expensive.

SOURCES:

The War Illustrated, Volume 9, No. 210, Page 140: https://web.archive.org/web/20160304162129/http://www.thewarillustrated.info/210/now-it-can-be-told-operation-fido-beating-airfield-fog.asp

The report of FIDO causing a thunderstorm is questionable (hence phrasing it as ""a report""), but it's on page 113 of the Daily Telegraph Book of the Weather here: https://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=0826471250

Thanks to animator Matt Ley for the wonderful cartoon of me: https://www.youtube.com/user/Thelaserbearguy

I put this together in three days, plus a day of checking and proofing, in Adobe After Effects. It took about eight hours to render, but that's because every frame has keying, lighting, camera, and motion blur effects, and because the original footage of me was in 4.6k lossless.

Yes, the sound of the black box working is the sound of a microwave (it's the one in my kitchen). Also, those aren't faked desktop screenshots, I had to install a copy of Windows ME to make this.

There are a lot of references and in-jokes in here, and hopefully people will spot most of them in the comments. But if anyone wants confirmation: yes, there are references to Billy Joel, Aqua, a He-Man remix, and Elton John. The last one's pretty obscure, well done to you at home if you got that.

2016-12-01T16:00:04Z,This giant model stopped a terrible plan,"John Reber had a plan: to dam the San Francisco Bay. He convinced some politicians - and it took the US Army Corps of Engineers, and the Bay Model they built in Sausalito, to prove him not just wrong, but dangerously wrong.

Thanks to all the team at the Bay Model! You can find out more here: http://www.spn.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/Bay-Model-Visitor-Center/

2016-11-17T16:00:04Z,3D Printing Stainless Steel with Giant Robot Arms,"At Autodesk's Pier 9 workshop in San Francisco -- and no, this isn't an ad, pull down the description for more! -- there are giant robot arms using welders to 3D print with stainless steel. Which seemed like a good place to talk about programming abstractions, high-level languages, training pendants, and just how safe something like a robot arm needs to be.

FULL DISCLOSURE: Autodesk were good enough to cover my travel to San Francisco, but they haven't paid me and they had no control over the script, the content or the final cut! You can see more about Pier 9 at http://www.autodesk.com/pier-9/

2016-11-14T16:00:02Z,The Spider Dress That Reacts To Personal Space Invaders,"Fashion-tech designer Anouk Wipprecht has built a Spider Dress, which reacts based on how close you're standing and how quickly you approached. It's based on 'proxemics': the study of personal space... although how much of that counts as science is an open question. Let's talk about Edward T Hall, about what counts as science, and what happens if you get too close to someone.

Anouk's dress is on display at the Autodesk Gallery in San Francisco until March 2017: http://www.autodesk.com/gallery/
You can follow the Autodesk Gallery on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/autodeskgallery/

2016-08-18T14:59:40Z,The Problem With Renewable Energy (and how we're fixing it),"( This isn't a sponsored video, but I am massively grateful to all the team at SSE! Go look: http://sse.com/whatwedo/ourprojectsandassets/ , and pull down the description for more. )
As the world switches to renewable energy - and we are switching - there's a problem you might not expect: balancing the grid. Rotational mass and system inertia are the things that keep your lights from flickering: and they only appear in big, old, traditional power stations. Here's why that's a problem, and how we're likely going to fix it.

CORRECTION: I say that turbines spin thousands of times ""per second"" when it should be ""per minute"". Apologies. You can find all corrections on this channel at https://www.tomscott.com/corrections/

Thanks to all the team at SSE! FULL DISCLOSURE: This is not a sponsored video, no money has changed hands, and SSE did not have editorial control. But they did go out of their way to arrange access and support for me and my team, including giving us safety training for working at heights. I am incredibly grateful to all the team: Paul and Ed for arranging it all; Bob and Scott who helped us at the turbine; and Calum, Head of Operations, who was keeping an eye on safety throughout.

GO LOOK AT SSE: http://sse.com/whatwedo/ourprojectsandassets/

The drone footage is from Cyberhawk, http://www.thecyberhawk.com: they normally do turbine inspections and land surveying, so I'd like to thank them for getting some artistic shots for us too!

2016-08-08T18:14:39Z,Hebocon UK: Deliberately Terrible Robot Fighting,"If your robot-building skills aren't quite up to Battlebots or Robot Wars, then Hebocon might be for you. Described ""as a robot sumo-wrestling competition for those who are not technically gifted"", the emphasis is on having fun, entertaining the crowd, and ""heboiness"".

At Electromagnetic Field 2016, a maker festival in the UK, I hosted one of the UK's first hebocon contests. I'll be honest: we skipped over a few of the more complicated rules about penalising high-tech robots in favour of entertaining the crowd, but no-one seemed to mind. Not even the actual Robot Wars competitors.

Thanks to everyone who helped put this together: Alia Sheikh, Andrew Vine and Robert McWilliam on the film crew, Jim MacArthur who actually ran the show, and all the folks at EMF Camp -- and of course, all the people who built the robots!

NOTES:
""Brass chisels can cause sparks"" is a summary of the inquest's findings. For those in the comments, here's the full version: ""in all probability the work of chipping out the C.E. [composition explosive] Exploder from a 1,000 lb M.C. bomb, using a brass chisel, was the cause of the explosion. It is known that C.E. will explode easily if struck between brass and steel surfaces"". In this context, 'brass chisels can cause sparks' does make sense!

The inquest looked at all the available evidence and judged that to be by far the most likely explanation (and the only one that made sense given all the facts).

I couldn't fix that in post, but since the river's basically the same for a mile or so in each direction with no significant confluences, it's a small enough slip that I don't think it's too bad. The amount of water is the same!

2016-04-14T14:52:16Z,"In Norway, Everyone Can Know How Much You Earn","Wage transparency is a strange concept for most of us: not so in some of the Nordic countries. And while Norway, Sweden and Finland differ in exactly the amount of access they give the public, fundamentally your tax return would be public knowledge there. So how does it affect the world? And is it a good idea?

Let's look at the science and find out.

If we'd have known the full context of the coup, which we didn't in the rush of filming, we wouldn't have made them. The fault lies solely with me as the editor: I should have fact-checked and understood the context before publishing.

(I should note: while Steam have officially confirmed ""a caching problem"", I've got no privileged information about the specifics. It's possible (but unlikely, I think) this was a misconfiguration at Akamai, or a bizarre server bug that happened to exactly match a much more likely caching misconfiguration error!)",dkSslseq9Y8

In Highland Park, in Los Angeles, sits something that most business analysts would say couldn't exist any more: an independent store selling soda pop. 700 flavours of it. 

There was so much I couldn't include in this thanks to my dodgy camerawork -- the create-your-own soda section, John's absolutely perfect recommendation for a soda I'd like. But hopefully I got all the important parts! If you're ever nearby, do stop in.

And that water comes from the LA Aqueduct, masterplanned by William Mulholland. The end of his career, though, wasn't such a triumph. This is the story of the St Francis Dam, and the collapse that stopped Los Angeles from taking over an entire valley.

CORRECTION: It actually held back 47 million tonnes of water, 470 times more than I said. I mistook the dam volume for the reservoir volume when researching! Thanks to Josh for pointing that out. For all corrections on this channel: https://www.tomscott.com/corrections/

Goalball was invented after World War 2 to help rehabilitate blinded ex-servicemen. Nearly seventy years later, it's now a Paralympic sport, where every player has a full blindfold and puts themselves deliberately in the way of a very heavy ball going at 25mph -- and in world-class games, anything up to 60mph. Do try this at home - just with the right safety equipment.

How do you train sailors to save a sinking ship? Sure, you can teach them the theory, but there's no replacement for having to hammer softwood wedges into deck and bulkhead splits that are spraying cold, high-pressure water in your face.

At HMS Excellent in Portsmouth sits Hazard, a Royal Navy Damage Repair Instructional Unit (DRIU).

In the foothills of the Dolomites, an hour or so north of Venice, lies Ai Pioppi, a restaurant that's home to an astonishing, giant, human-powered, kinetic-art theme park playground. It was designed and made by a man called Bruno over forty years, and it's free for folks who eat at the restaurant.

I'll be honest: I sort of thought it was a myth. The idea of unattended, huge kinetic ride-on sculptures was surely false? There was some evidence: a very artfully-shot documentary, and some shaky tourist footage, but I couldn't quite believe that something this potentially dangerous could still exist.

So on Easter weekend, when it was quiet, Paul (@cr3) and I took a road trip to try it. And it's real. It's very, very real. Watch as we try and take a somersault on the Bicycle of Death.

And if you don't take the right amount of caution, it can hurt you -- although my eventual injury didn't come through any rides, but just by tripping over by running!

AI PIOPPI: http://www.aipioppi.com/
Opening hours vary, closed most weekdays and all winter, check before travelling

Thanks to Paul, who drove me to the hospital; thanks to the doctors and nurses at Treviso Hospital, too. And Europeans: remember to take an EHIC card on holiday around Europe, so your healthcare travels with you. I didn't have to pay a penny or deal with travel insurance!

And more than that: if you do go, and I recommend you do if you're ever anywhere near it: TAKE CARE. Even when you're on an adrenaline high and you think you're invincible. I wasn't. You won't be either. Hospital visits in a foreign language aren't fun!",iCQEc736GO4

For younger viewers, and those outside the UK -- say anyone who doesn't remember the Channel Tunnel opening -- ""rabies"" may just be one of those things you hear about on the news sometimes. But there are a lot of people who are proud of Britain being free of it. Here's why.

I'm indebted to Pemberton and Worboys' wonderful ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen: Rabies in Britain 1830-2000"" - http://amzn.to/1xr1x2B - for a lot of fact-checking here, as well as inspiration. It turns out this is a properly fascinating subject: I had to cut so many fascinating things out of my script. (A five-minute monologue to camera on a windy beach isn't interesting.) I recommend you at least get the book from your local library. For example...

FACT: The requirement for muzzling dogs extended to tiny, tame lapdogs, but not to ""sporting"" dogs, those used for hunting -- because the men writing the laws didn't want to muzzle their own dogs. (Their dogs were upper class, manly dogs, how could they be rabid?)

FACT: The first ever human vaccine was created for rabies, by Louis Pasteur -- the medical genius who gave his name to pasteurisation, among many other things. If you're at risk these days, you can get vaccinated: but it's not given as standard in the UK, because, hey, we don't have rabies -- and it's a better idea to vaccinate the animals that might carry it.

FACT: Before the EU pet travel scheme came into force in 2000, any animal coming into the UK had to be quarantined -- completely separated from its owners and other animals -- for three months to be sure it wasn't rabid. Not many people took their pets overseas.

Seriously, I got really absorbed in researching this. Further reading:

Oh - and if you want to play about with ley line data yourself, I made http://www.tomscott.com/ley/ a couple of years ago. It still gets me occasional disappointed emails from believers.

So I'm about to go against my vow of descriptivism, and risk being run over by the Linguistic Mafia's bus, and say this: it's a silly idea.


CORRECTIONS
March 9th, 2019

Back in 2013, I made a video about ‚Äòsingular they‚Äô and gender-neutral pronouns. Looking back on it with half a decade of hindsight, there are several things I want to correct. I also have a few thoughts on how the reactions to it have changed over time, and why the video‚Äôs comments will remain off.

Firstly, while editing the video, I cut the first sentence of the script. That sentence didn‚Äôt seem to add anything, and I‚Äôm a believer in ‚Äòdon‚Äôt bore us, get to the chorus‚Äô. That would have been fine ‚Äî if only the script didn‚Äôt refer back to that first sentence later on, noting that the viewer probably didn‚Äôt notice the singular they in it.

There used to be an annotation explaining that mistake, but YouTube‚Äôs deleted all annotations now. I regret the error.

Secondly, I mentioned that recently-coined gender-neutral prounouns (hir, xe, etc) haven‚Äôt caught on in regular usage, and that trying to deliberately add new words into a language is extremely difficult. I think that‚Äôs true, but my tone was a bit too dismissive ‚Äî there was an implied value judgment there. I‚Äôd rephrase that in a second video.

And finally, I co-opted a couple of LGBT slogans, both in the title of the video and the video itself. Those aren‚Äôt my slogans to rewrite, and adding ‚Äòwith apologies to‚Äô in the reference line isn‚Äôt a great way of solving that. Looking back, I‚Äôm uncomfortable with those.
Changing times

In 2013, the video was uncontroversial. You can see that in this chart of likes and dislikes over time from YouTube‚Äôs analytics tool:

[graph available on https://www.tomscott.com/gender-neutral-pronouns/ ]

The video received very few dislikes until 2016. And I remember the comments from back then: those dislikes weren‚Äôt from angry conservative types. Instead, those were speakers of languages that used grammatical gender ‚Äî they were angry that I‚Äôd insulted their language!

But you can see the tide start to shift in 2016. This is why I turned off comments: it seems that a small number of people with limited empathy deliberately search out videos about subjects like this just so they can hit ‚Äòdislike‚Äô, leave awful comments that are usually one of a few toxic in-jokes, and go. YouTube's moderation tools remain desperately inadequate at dealing with that problem without appointing full-time moderators, and frankly, that would be time and money that could be better spent on almost anything else. For that reason, the comments are going to remain off.

If I were to remake this video in 2019, the most significant change would be focus: the title would be all about singular they, not gender-neutral pronouns. It probably wouldn‚Äôt even mention LGBT issues beyond a quick reference. It wouldn‚Äôt be a shout of hey, did you know about these folks, because five years later, most people watching the video do. Instead, it‚Äôd be a quiet nod of I see you.

What worked for a 2013 audience doesn‚Äôt work in 2019.

It seems that, over the last few years, non-binary and trans folks have reached stage three on the Williams Scale: ‚Äòthen they fight you‚Äô. Hopefully, it won't take long to reach stage four: ‚Äòthen you win‚Äô.",46ehrFk-gLk

2013-03-06T13:07:03Z,A Brief History of Lyric Videos,"http://tomscott.com - http://twitter.com/tomscott - There's a good argument that lyric videos count as a whole new genre. Here's that genre's history, presented in its own style.

Lyric videos are all over YouTube like a rash. Record companies love 'em. And for good reason.

They're very cheap, compared to a full video. They can be released earlier, which means there's more than a static picture for the many people who mainly listen to music through YouTube. And they separate the official release from all the unofficial fan videos that inevitably pop up.

Lyric videos are older than that, though. There's an argument that Bob Dylan's 1965 Subterranean Homesick Blues counts as one.

In 1987, Prince's video for Sign O The Times was perhaps the first proper lyric video. Just pulsing shapes and moving words, complete with the slightly dodgy punctuation and abbreviations that you'd see from an amateur video today.

And in 1990, George Michael's ""Praying for Time"" just had classy white text on a black background. That wouldn't look out of place if it'd been put together a quarter of a century later in Windows Movie Maker.

The modern, professional lyric video can trace its roots back to kinetic, or dynamic, typography. Inspired by, among others, the movie titles of designer Saul Bass, there was a YouTube trend for taking famous scenes from films and animating the dialogue. Jarratt Moody's dynamic 'Pulp Fiction' scene stole the show here.

That led to a trend through 2010 for animated lyrics - most notably a gorgeous and painstakingly-animated video for Jonathan Coulton's Shop Vac uploaded in November 2010. But by then, Katy Perry's management had started releasing simple lyric videos - just subtitles on a photo background. These were to compete with the fans, who'd been putting up unofficial ones for years. These unofficial videos often had inaccurate or mispelled lyrics, and in some cases - to get around YouTube's automated copyright systems - they'd speed up the music slightly, mangling the original track just so their lyric tribute could survive.

In 2010, Cee-Lo Green made the first mainstream, dynamic, and massively popular modern lyric video - for the song that middle America knew as 'Forget You'. And suddenly, everyone had to have one.

Some of them are amazing feats of design, and have brought the art of motion graphics back into the public eye. Some of them... are terrible. But as long as YouTube's around: well, they're here to stay.",3P0BKrOlBVM

Did you really do this?
    Yes. Pretty much as you see here.

Did it really hurt that much?
    Yes, it did.

Wimp.
    Possibly. Try giving yourself first-degree burns and then scouring them with acidic fruit gunk every day. (Don't actually do this.)

Why didn't you stop earlier?
    I'm stubborn.

How did you do that final shot?
    I added the red glow in later. It's the only part of this that isn't genuine.

Hang on, how are you cutting that pineapple on Day 8?
    Good spot ‚Äî but if you look closely, I'm holding the knife and pineapple mostly with my palms and the lower parts of my fingers. It's amazing how quickly I adapted to not being able to use my fingertips. Plus, I mentioned in the previous shot that I was only scouring last thing at night, and at that point it was helping ‚Äî at the time I was cutting that pineapple, it had been about 24 hours since the last scour, so it wasn't too bad.

Is it possible to remove your fingerprints, though, if you maybe spend every hour of the day doing gentle work with pineapple?
    Possibly, but the only evidence for bromelain actually removing fingerprints so far seems to be anecdotal. If anyone can find any journal articles, though, I'll happily update this. Please don't try it yourself.
