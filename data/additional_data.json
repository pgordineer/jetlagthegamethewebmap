        "transcript": "Welcome to Europe  home to the open-border\nSchengen Area  and the board for our most ambitious\ncountry claiming game ever. We're here outside\nVictoria Station in London  because over the next six days \nwe're gonna compete to see which team can visit\nthe most European countries. But right now  it's 6:30 am... So we gotta go  go  go! Get the camera \nget the camera  get the camera! Let's go! Alright  Ben! Let's gooooo! This way!\nWe gotta plan. We gotta plan. In this game \nthe goal is simple: The team that controls\nthe most countries at the end of six days wins. In play are the 29 countries\nin the Schengen Area  plus these microstates. To claim a country \nall we need to do is go there. We can take as many trains \nbuses  or ferries as we like  and we have a $4 000\nbudget for flights. Once we've claimed a country \nit's ours  but it's still vulnerable to\nbeing stolen by the other team. If we want to\npermanently lock down our ownership of\na particular country  we'll have one attempt to complete\nthat country's challenge. These challenges were all written\nby our colleague Amy  so none of us will know\nwhat any of them are until we open\nthat country's envelope and read the challenge. If we complete\nthe challenge successfully  that country is locked\nand it will remain in our control until the end of the game. But if we fail or choose not\nto attempt the challenge  the opposing team could\nattempt to steal it. If they travel to the country and complete\nits challenge successfully  then they'll steal control and lock it down for\nthe rest of the game. So now both  teams are off to figure out how they're\ngoing to get out of London and where they want to head first\nto start claiming countries. Okay.\nAlrighty. Here's the basic situation. There are three potential\nopening options. Three clusters of countries. One option is that\nyou take the Eurostar and you kind of hit\nthe Benelux area: France  Belgium \nNetherlands  Germany. Potentially you get\nLuxembourg in there. I suspect that\nthey're really gonna wanna do that. Tom  wait! Alright  alright \nright  right  so... Alright.\nEurostar  right? Clearly train.\nClearly the train. I think so. Well  let's check the schedules\nof the Eurostar. Second option:\nYou fly to Vienna  and you can pretty quickly get\nAustria  the Czech Republic  Slovakia  and Hungary. And this  is  you know  we've talked about\nthis option a lot before. They're definitely\ngonna consider that as well. I mean  the only other thing \nas I'm sure they know  would be that there are\na lot of countries near Vienna. Yes. I think there are two\nreally obvious plays. Yeah. But there is also\na secret third option that has not yet come up\nin the group playtesting. No  I don't think\nthey've considered it. And that is to fly\nto Zurich  Switzerland  because from there \nyou can get Switzerland  Austria  Liechtenstein  and in fact  if they\ntake the Eurostar  you can get to Germany\nbefore them and steal it right out\nfrom under them. Let's take a look at the tracker. 'Cause we can tell\nif they're gonna go for the Eurostar pretty quickly when they leave here.\nYeah. We have their location.\nThey have our location. Yeah.\nSo... (laughs) We could wait\nto see what they do! They could make\nthe 8:30 to Vienna  which is currently running\n15 minutes late on the flights. Well  here's actually\nthe interesting thing. That's not showing\nas bookable anymore. Oh? Then the obvious play is... train  train. Yeah.\nLet's go. Just go up to St Pancras?\nYeah. Alright  let's do it. Oh  they're moving.\nThey're moving. Oh  they're\ngetting on a train. Let's follow them\nand see what they're doing. Okay. Stealth mode. You see them?\nI don't see them. No  they've disappeared.\nThey've disappeared. They've done a\nwonderful disappearing act. Okay. I should introduce myself  and let the audience\nthat don't know me: Hi  I'm Tom. I run a podcast called Lateral\nabout weird questions  which the three have been on. And I used to do\na lot more videos on YouTube than I do now. Tom is known for\nhaving been everywhere. I'm not Bob Dylan. That's Johnny Cash!\nIt's Johnny Cash! Train number one of\nhow many do you think  Tom? Far too many. I don't think there's any\nsuch thing as too many trains. (chuckles) Okay  yes  it looks like\nthey're going north. Okay.\nTo St Pancras. Which would mean...\nJust as I suspected. That they're doing Eurostar  which means that\nwe should go to Heathrow. So predictable  boys. If we wanna get\nthat flight to Zurich  we gotta go now.\nOkay  how do we get there? We need to get on\nthe District Line  Benjamin. District Line.\nOh  then  we shall. Then we shall get on\nthe District Line. District Line.\nI think this is us. We're getting on the Tube. Mind the gap between\nthe train and the platform. Alright  let's go. Uhh yeah  this way. Got a British train\ntrivia fact for you. I know all the trivia  Tom.\nMhm. How many international stations\nare there  in the UK? There's this.\nYep. Ashford International.\nYep. I think Ebbsfleet is one.\nYep  yep. And you're probably gonna try\nto trick question me with Dover. How many of those have\ninternational service? One. Just this one.\nWell  there's— No  there's the—\nthere's the shuttle. Nope  not an\ninternational station. But you go—\nThe only— There are loads of stations with\n'International' in the name  and only one of them is\nactually international. But you have the international\nservice at that one. Welcome to St Pancras! I think you're\nchanging the subject  Tom. Okay  Ben \nwe just got service. I can confirm that\nthey are at St Pancras. This also means that\nthey know where we are. They are gonna now know\nthat we're headed to Heathrow. It'll be interesting to see\nif they can figure out that we're gonna scoop them. Yeah.\nIn Germany. I don't know. Okay.\nAlright  well... Those are our choices. So we have to take... A: the one to Paris nonstop... 9:01 to Lille or Brussels. I... do not like Paris as an option. Yeah  no  definitely. It's 'cause the thing is \nfrom Brussels... you can get pretty quickly\nto Germany  to the Netherlands. Luxembourg. Back to France\nif you wanted to. Yeah.\nSo we're in a great region. That's a good point. We can go back to France\nfrom Brussels if you want to have 'em. I think... we want to take\nthe 9:01 to Brussels because we can pass\nthrough France. Yeah. Claim the country.\nWe won't lock it. We can claim it\nand claim Brussels. And if we need to  if it looks like there\nmight be a threat that someone's gonna\ntake France away from us  we can go back there. Just real quick  something Tom and I\nforgot to mention here: While the train to Brussels\ndoes stop in Lille  France  allowing us to theoretically get out and attempt the challenge\nto lock France  there's not a train today from\nLille to Brussels until 1:30  meaning we'd lose several hours\njust waiting around in Lille. That's why we're planning\nto stay on the train through Lille and get off in Belgium:\nclaiming France  but not locking it. Yeah.\nAny challenge to France would not be for days.\nYeah. So it'd be safe to\nnot lock it immediately. So I think I like the plan\nof going to Brussels  even though it wastes us \nI mean... ...an hour and a half. Yeah  but they're gonna\nbe wasting their time at airport security and check-in. Let's check the tracker.\nYeah. Flight leaves in 62 minutes. Yeah  flight leaves in an hour. Alright.\nWe got it. The old travelator is broken. But we got two freaking travelators extending from our torsos. That's so true. The lads are at Heathrow. Alright. I realize you call 'em like...\nother than the lads. But I'm British.\nSo I'm calling them the lads. Okay. You can call 'em what you want. (laughs)\nI've got some ideas! They're at terminal two \nwhich is Austrian Airlines. Okay.\nSo... I guess they're going\nto Vienna? Everything fits. I don't know why they'd\ndo anything but that. So...\nThey're going to Vienna. Yeah. They're going to Vienna \nwhich means good news. We don't have to worry about them\ninterfering with our plans today. God damn!\nI know. Okay  well  we've burned\nabout 10 minutes just getting to the terminal. As long as the security's\nnot that bad  we should be fine. Security's that way. Fast track. Look how luxurious. We are fast tracking. Hopefully we don't\nneed that $30 later. Alright  carriage one \nseat 68. Tom  do you know why\nthe Eurostars are so long? I don't know why\nthe Eurostars are so— Oh  because any train\nin the Channel Tunnel needs to be able to split into two\nand hold all the— Hi  thank you. (laughs) That would've been bad.\nThat would've been bad. Yes  you're right.\nIt's the Channel Tunnel. Yeah  they have to be able to\nevacuate all the passengers in either half of the train. In case  yeah  one power car breaks down.\nThat's a big reason why it's been so hard for\nother train companies to start service.\nRight. No problem.\nNailed it. We did get randomly selected  so truly everything that\ncould have gone wrong did go wrong  but we're fine. I tell you one thing  Ben. They definitely did not\ntake the 8:01 to Paris. It's very curious. I really thought if they\nwere gonna take the train  they were gonna take\nthe earlier one. I mean  maybe they aren't\ngonna stop and do challenges. Maybe they're just gonna go\nstraight through to Brussels. Guess we'll see.\nBut we know where we're going. Zurich  baby. Off we go.\nIt's Zurich time. So... I mean  we've\ngot a lock on them. We know where they are.\nYeah  and it— And we know\nwhat gate they're at. Certainly looks\nlike the right one for the live location of the London to Vienna flight.\nYeah. So I think we can\nconsider that confirmed. Right. Which means they're not\ngonna bother us today. Yes. Is that it?\nAnd that is the tunnel. Good bye  Britain.\nWe're on our way. Tom now thinks\nwe're leaving the tunnel. Let's see. Oh  nailed it. Thank you. Nailed it.\nI'll take that. Nailed it.\nWait  we can text them. Oh  we can text them  yes.\nWe're in the lead  Tom. France claimed. Okay. That is one-nil. We have the\npsychological advantage. And we're about\nto get to two-nil before they can get\ntheir first country. But we haven't locked France.\nWe have not locked France. We're not going to right now.\nYeah. Certainly not now.\nWe have no— I mean  we're not gonna\nget off and do it. No. I hate that we are... going through so many countries\nwithout locking them. We don't need to right now.\nThey're not on our tail. They're off sorting\nthemselves out in Vienna. Hello.\nGuten Tag. So we're about\n20 minutes from landing. Slight wrinkle. We've been looking\nat our options to Germany. We realized\nthat if they decide to go straight to Germany... If they skip\nthe France challenge  leave France vulnerable...\nSkip the Belgium challenge... Yeah  they skip\nthe Belgium challenge. They could beat us there... by about 15 minutes. We don't have service\nright now  so... We don't know\nwhat they're doing. We will know... what they've done\nwhen we land. (inhales deeply)\nYeah  we'll see. Oh  there we go. Oh. There's Belgium.\nThat is Belgium. Country number two.\nEyy! Country number two. Let's text 'em. Belgium claimed. Two-nil. So the question is now \nwhat next? We want to at least\ntick off Germany. And the Netherlands.\nAnd the Netherlands. I don't think we're gonna\nmake it to Luxembourg  or that there's a good way to\nmake it to Luxembourg. No  'cause the train\ndown to there takes like three hours.\nYeah. Most geographically close.\nYeah. There is a high-speed line\nfrom Brussels into Germany that goes through Aachen. And then from there \nwe can take a relatively short train to Maastricht  Netherlands.\nRight. Once we're in\nAachen and Maastricht and Liège  that area \nwe're about equidistant between Brussels and Dusseldorf\nand Cologne Airport. It's kinda an hour and a bit\nin either direction. But the thing is  no matter where\nwe want to go tomorrow  there's a thing that seems\nto basically always happen where there are morning flights\nand evening flights. And there aren't\nmidday flights  'cause the commuters go\nmorning and evening. Yeah. The thing that\nwe need to think about is  what is more worth it? Is it locking countries today\nor getting on those flights that we want tomorrow morning?\nMmmh. Honestly  I think it is unlikely that we will be able to lock\nGermany  Netherlands  and Belgium (sighs)\nand get back by the end of the day. I agree. But I think we need to lock\nas many as we can. Yes. Alright  Ben.\nA lot of stuff going on. But we gotta get\noff the plane first. Tom  I have news. (cracks up)\nI don't like this. You've got an ominous voice \nand you're filming. I don't like this at all. They're not in Vienna. They're not in Vienna?\nWhere did they go? We even checked the gate! Zurich. It was like— There was also a Zurich flight\nleaving right next to them at the same time. Why Zurich? That's certainly interesting. They might be about to\nmake a run for Germany. (grumbles) We thought they weren't\ngonna interfere with us. Okay. Yeah. Oh  that would make sense. But... That would absolutely make sense. (exhales loudly) Augh! That's annoyingly good. They can challenge France.\nThey can claim Germany and try it. And they've got Switzerland. And they've got a very easy run\nto Vienna tomorrow  haven't they? I have forgotten Liechtenstein. Mhm? (hoots quietly) Oh  oh  we could. Alright  Adam.\nWelcome to Switzerland. Alright  Switzerland\nis now claimed. Claimed.\nNot locked. Not locked.\nBut claimed. Oh  lots going on. We are entering\nthe Schengen Zone. Here's the situation. They have figured out\nwhat we are doing and they're making\na beeline for Germany. They certainly are. I think that means\nthat they can beat us there by like 15 minutes. Yeah  depending... on how quickly we get\noutta here though. We could beat them to Germany.\nYeah? Because if they get\non a train in six minutes  which they're not going to \nI don't think... No  there's no way they're\noff the plane this early. They would get there 1:28.\nWe're gonna get there at 1:36. So if we're fast\nwith the challenge... This is assuming\nthey're going to Basel. Yeah. If they beeline to Germany  there might be\na faster route there. I didn't look that much  but... Germany is not afford—\nGermany is not certain. So  we still run for\nGermany fast as we can? Think so  yeah.\nAlright. It's less \"mind the gap\"\nand more \"mind the gaping abyss\". Ah  alright  let's go. Welcome to Brussels  Tom. We wanna make a train\nin 20 minutes. Right. That'll get us\nsuper fast to Germany. You think we can\nbeat them to Germany? Maybe.\nIf they're going that way. Maybe they're\nnot going that way. Maybe they're gonna pull\na challenge card in Switzerland and see what we do. Well  I looked\nat the train to Basel. Yeah?\nAnd if they're going to Basel... we can beat them  I think. But there might be a route... Zurich Airport is not far\nfrom the German border. It's possible that\nthere's another route  even like on buses maybe  that could take them\nover the border. But it would require them\nto take a less advantageous route in order to have a higher\nchance of competing with us. Which is not a good strategy. Maybe it is. I don't know.\nIt depends on risk. But that doesn't change\nwhat we need to do  which is— No. We need to just get to Germany as quickly as possible \nand go from there. We're going to\nGermany regardless. Alright. I guess we've just\ngotta hope that... their immigration at... at Zurich Airport is slow \nbut it's Zurich Airport. Yeah.\nIt's not gonna be. Swiss efficiency.\nYeah. Well  good news. We made it through customs\nin like... five minutes. Yeah  but... 12:06 was the train\nwe needed to make. And it's 12:09.\nYeah  I'm not sure that it actually\nopens up any options  but we're gonna...\nwe're gonna hurry and see. The name of the game\nright now is just  can we beat them to Germany? We'll do the challenge\nhere later. We're not worried about that. Yeah. There's just— There's gotta be a way\nto do this  man. Platform 3.\n\"Liege\"? Liège? \"Leis\"? That one.\nYeah. Right. They're not even boarding yet. Sam  this is a\nDeutsche Bahn train. I... I have watched Jet Lag. I know how slow\nand how inefficient Deutsche Bahn has been\nfor you in the past. Zug fällt aus.\nWhat does that mean? Noooo. Zug fällt \"auf\". I know what that means. They're all delayed. None of this makes any sense. None of this makes any sense! (cracks up) The train is\ndelayed for 45 minutes. We're gonna blame this one on\nour good friends Deutsche Bahn. It's here. We're good. It's here. It's perfect weather outside. Yeah  it's windy\nout there  you know. You know  it is the kind of weather\nthat trains in Germany absolutely love to plow through. Let's see where they are. Yeah. I mean  they're probably doing a whole thing right now\nabout like... how fast do we need\nto get to Germany? Yeah. If they have a route \nand they consider it to be worth it  they're gonna take it.\nYeah. Ooh  ooh  what's this? Oh  Ben. Yeah?\nThis is it. What? If we can get\non this 12:19 train  that's our ticket. When does that\nget us into Germany? It gets us through Germany\n20 minutes before them. But we would be\npassing through... We need to declare.\nAdam  where are you going? It gets us through Germany way faster than them \nand then we would double back. But I think we would\neven still be able to start the challenge before them. Go.\nI'm  I'm... I'm looking into their\nroute options to Germany. Mhm?\nAnd I'm feeling... cautiously... cautiously optimistic.\n(chuckles warily) Okay. That we will at least be\nthe first ones... Across the border.\nto cross the border. It's... it's... it's tight. I think we're gonna make it. Okay. This all obviously assumes that\nthey are heading up to Germany. But I have to believe that they are. They will... They're gonna know\nwe're going to Germany. 'Cause why would we\nnot go to Germany? Yeah  obviously.\nAnd... I know this is the kind of\nthing that temps fate  but like I don't... ...think they have a route from Zurich Hauptbahnhof\ninto Germany quicker than us at this point. What's it looking like? Start— They're on the move. Okay. They're on the move \nand I can't tell where  but I think it's Aachen. I think that they're doing\nwhat we think. Okay  well— Okay  we need\nto get to platform— They're going to Aachen.\nWe've gotta go to Schaffhausen. You know the saying. Adam  I have bad news.\nWhat's that? It's a German train. Well... This is never a good sign. Is this first class?\nThis one is for children. There's no one in\nthe one for children. I don't wanna go in\nthe car that's for children. Okay. Ohhh. This was supposed to be so easy. We were just gonna go and we were gonna\nswoop up and get Germany  and they were gonna be\nnone the wiser. Oh man.\nOh  okay. This... And the German train\nhas left exactly on time. (exhales deeply) Okay  it's just one stop. Okay. I don't know if they're\ngonna see this move coming. I think that they think... they scooped our scoop.\nBut we have re-scooped. We did a re-scoop \nand that's actually key. This game is all about\nscooping and re-scooping. It's mostly a game\nabout scoops  so... So  based on the tracker  they're both still\nin Zurich Station  and the train— Ooh. Now they're moving.\nNow they're moving out. I can see that moving.\nNow they're moving out  but... that's three minutes later\nthan the train to Basel. So  okay \nwhat train are they on? I dunno. Okay  so... here's the deal. So this train is gonna\ncut through Germany. Pretty early. So we'll definitely be\nin Germany first  which means that\nwe'll have claimed it. Not locked it  but claimed it.\nYes. But we can't get off\nthe train in Germany 'cause there's no stop there. Yeah  it'll actually go back\ninto Switzerland and stop there. So we're gonna have to ride it\none more stop up into Germany. Into Singen. Yeah  and then\nwe can get off there and do the challenge. You want some intel? Yeah.\nNot going to Basel. Oh? Their train has turned north. North? North  which...\nWhere...? That could be a train\ntowards Germany. Okay. Because the borders get\nweird around there  right? Yeah  and I honestly \nI don't know... because I didn't have enough time\nto look at all the options. I don't know whether\nthey can beat us. (whispers) Okay. We're getting close. Yep. Sounds like you've got news. I might have news. I found a train line... that would beat us\nOkay. to Germany.\nAlright. And it matches with\nthe route that they're on  and it matches with\nthe departure time. So  I think they've got Germany. Okay. Here's the thing. They might still fail the challenge. Germany might still\nbe open for later. Benjamin... I'm thrilled to welcome you to\nthe wonderful country of Germany. Excellent. Let's inform them. (both sigh) They're not gonna like that. Feels so good to be\nin Germany. They're not\ngoing to like that. (grumbles) Okay. Here's the question  Tom. Mhm? Do we continue on to... Aachen? I feel the\ncorrect strategy is... I would rather lock down\nBelgium and Netherlands and have a chance of\nsolidly getting that. Yeah. Rather than taking a punt\non doing a challenge  wasting time on the challenge \nand still being beaten. I think I agree.\nThat's gonna suck. Yeah  I agree. I think we run. I don't think it's worth...\nAs in we get off in Liège. Yeah.\nI think I agree... because... I really want to take one of those morning\nflights tomorrow and therefore inevitably \none of the three countries here  we're just gonna have\nto claim  but not lock. Just real quick  part of why we're under\nsuch a time crunch here is that the game day\nends at 5:30 pm  then we will restart at\n7:30 am the next day. That means if we wanna make a flight\nfirst thing in the morning  we need to end our day\nnear an airport. So that should be Germany.\nSo if— We've got competition for it.\nYeah  if they've— If they're getting Germany  we should just let them\nhave Germany. Yeah.\nAnd invest our time in the places that are\nnot a 50-50 shot where we can at least\nbe first one there. That's crazy.\nYeah. Ben  it's bundling up time. Well  let's bundle up. It's simply time to bundle. Belgium. The minute we open that...\nthings start to happen. High speed. This is it. Right. We have just under— right.\n(laughs) Okay  yes. Go  go  go  go  go. Alright. Come on  let's go. Let's go  let's go  let's go.\nThis is lovely. Look  the stairs are right there.\nThis is perfect. So should I—\nOkay  excellent  yeah. Pull it  pull it  pull it. Oh  here we go.\nWe're getting started. Play waffle pong. Play waffle pong. Belgium is known for their waffles. Get a waffle and\none container or package of a food that comes in pieces that would fit in\nthe waffle's holes. Think M&Ms  gummy bears \npeas  that kind of thing. Place the waffles six feet or\ntwo meters away from you. You must land a small food in each of the waffle's\ncomplete holes to win. You may only throw each\nunit of small food once. If you run out of small food and have not filled\nthe waffle  you fail. Regardless  you must\neat the waffle and anything you caught in it\nat the end of the challenge. Regardless \nyou must eat the waffle and anything you—\nLet's go get a waffle. Come on  right.\nOkay  so we need the... We need a waffle with few holes.\nWe need a con— No  we need— We need a convenience store\nthat has small  cheap waffles. There's a Carrefour. Let's go  let's go \nlet's go  let's go. Oh  Tom's going very fast. Alright.\nAlright buddy. We're in Germany. Let's get— Welcome to Germany. Let's get to an open spot and let's open up\nthe stinkin' challenge. I'm scared Ben.\nI'm scared too. Look how cute. Pretty cute. Let's go set it up and\nlet's kick it  buddy. Yep. It's time to open\nthe Germany challenge and see what it is. Eat a food in\nits namesake place. Eat a food in\nits namesake place. Tons of foods are named\nafter German places – hamburgers  frankfurters \nand pilsners  to name a few. To complete this challenge \nyou must eat a food in the geographic area\nfrom which it derives its name. You have 30 minutes after\nyou enter a geographic area to take a bite of its titular food.\nYou may only attempt once. If you are currently\nin a geographic area with a food named after it  your 30 minutes starts\nwhen you realize that. Oh dear. We may not be. This could be a problem. Let's find out. I'm actually pretty\nworried about this. Are they still\nheading towards Aachen  or are they stopped?\nIt's hard to tell. I think that either they got out\nor their train is delayed. Bakery  bakery \nbakery  bakery. Tiny waffles. These are technically waffles.\nNow— No  that. See  those holes\nare a little— they're a little tight.\nYes  okay. We want deep \nlarge holes  I think. You— you make your own jokes. Food named after Singen. Maybe we should\njust look around and we see if we see\nanything named after Singen. Oh  no. I don't... This is not good. This is not good. Look  this one\nonly has 1  2  3  4  and they're deeper. Okay  that waffle. Now we need tiny food things\nto throw into it. So...\nOh  well... (yammers) That is a single cone\nof pick and mix. It's true that\nthat's a container. Yeah  okay. I think that's fair\nthat this is a container. Yes. Let's do it. Let's just look in the\nconvenience store and see. No. Hi. Wait  wait  wait  wait. Black Forest cake. Black Forest region. We can get into the\nBlack Forest region if we get on that train. If we get on\nthe train to Basel? Yeah. I think  I think. I still don't know\nif we're gonna be able to do that in 30 minutes. But we can try. Alright  let's go. I think let's go\nunder the cover. Yeah  agreed. 'Cause the rain may have\nstopped for now  but... Step one... we've gotta find the waffle\nwith the fewest holes. That's a four hole waffle. See if we can beat four. That's a three—\nThat's a two hole waffle! Really?\nThat is a two hole. There are only—\nThat's— Mm. Is that one a— That's not a hole. No  it's not complete.\nThat's not a hole. That's a two hole waffle.\nI mean  there  I don't— We're not gonna beat that.\nPhysics  we can't beat that. Alright. Right  we're gonna go\none at a time. Try and get my eye in. Oho! Come on! Hit the waffle\non the first attempt. And the second. This is more difficult\nthan we hoped. So we need Black— We need to eat Black Forest cake\nin the Black Forest region. This goes into the\nBlack Forest region? It should based on what I saw. And if we— and if it doesn't \nwe wanna get on it anyway. Right  'cause it goes to Basel. Oh  come on! Hold up. Why are we— Why do we\nnot have a backboard? I don't know. Sam  there's... Put it against the wall! Okay.\nPut it against the— Why are we not putting\nit against the wall? Get out of there  pigeon.\n(bleep) off. Oh!\nThat was close. That was close. Oh  that rolled up it! Oh  come on  you son of a... Oh! This is infuriating! (gasps) Yes! Alright.\nYes! Alright  alright.\nCome on! Alright  you've got your eye in.\nLock in. Yeah— no!\nNo  it's the wrong hole. No  it's the wrong hole.\nIt's the wrong hole. It's the wrong hole.\nIt's not even a real hole. It has been 15 minutes. No.\nDid you just— Okay  so now we\nneed to make a plan for exactly how we're gonna\nget cake once we get there. I'm going through\nthis supermarket's website  which is all in German. But I found a category\nfor Tortin. Okay  we need Schwarz... Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte. I'm trying to figure out\nwhich part of that word means which thing. Can we assemble\na wall of waffle? Doesn't say we can't. Yeah— It's the other hole! Okay  well  at least\nit's definitely... It's definitely possible. It bounced off the waffle wall\nand went in. The strategy works. (gasps) Not the right hole. We got another hole? Oh  come on \nSam  you're so close. Ohh.\nOhh  no! Come on.\nNo  no  no  no  no! Okay  okay.\nWell we have a knock— We can knock—\nWe have a knockin. Knockin potential.\nWe have a knockin. Surely  surely. Tom  come. (both groaning) Oh  you've got\ntwo in the wrong hole! That... sounds weird. How do you spell—\nAccording to this  they are still at that station. How do you spell—\nOkay  I've got it. They're either stuck there or...\nI don't know what they're doing. No! No  no  no  no! Keep going  keep going.\nKeep going! We can knock that in. No! (gasps)\nCome on! At this point  this is absurd. Gah  how?! That's the game! Let's call them.\nLet's call them. We've got— no \nwe've gotta eat the waffle. No  well  let's\ncall them as we eat it. Oh  I think that\nthey just claimed Belgium. Locked Belgium? I think they just\nlocked Belgium is my guess. Hey  look. Tom's eating a\ndelicious little snack. Because we've just\ncompleted waffle pong. We have successfully\nthrown little candies into the waffle holes.\nThat's fun. (full mouth) As soon as this\ngoes down my gullet hole... in about a minute \nwe will have locked the great country of Belgium. Look at his gullet hole! His gullet hole is winning\nthis for us. Congratulations. Congratulations\non what's happening with your gullet hole. It's very impressive. We're very impressed by it. Good timing actually. Can you start\ncleaning up the violets? I'm gonna try and get\nthis down my throat. These taste awful. The little purple things?\nMhm. Explains why there were\nso many of them left. There we go. Belgium locked! Oh  that was a\ncrisp high five  Tom. First locked country.\nMhm. How does that feel \nBen and Adam? I'm a little bit annoyed\nthat they claimed Belgium  but I'm glad  obviously  that they decided to do\nthe challenge in Belgium. Slowing down their ability\nto get to Germany. Because now I think\nwe can complete this challenge. And we're already on our way\nback towards France. I don't think\nthat they realized that if they had\njust gone to Aachen  they would've actually\nwould've been able to beat us at the challenge.\nYeah. Probably.\nProbably. Because Aachen has that pastry\nthat's named after it. Yeah. Jet Lag is an\nethical travel show. And therefore\nwe clean up our trash. Do you want\nsomething to sweep with? There's gotta be\nsomething to sweep with. Eh. I think it's fine. (belches loudly) Oh  sorry.\nOh my god. (laughs) Got a request for you  Sam.\nYes? Whatever we just spent\non pick and mix and waffles... will Jet Lag give\nthat to a food bank or a charity or\nsomething In Belgium? Yeah.\nAlright. Then I don't feel too bad\nabout wasting some... very cheap  terrible food. Look  we're taking this\noutta the supply chain for children  right?\n(laughs) That's our ethics for the day. Maastricht  2:08?\nYep. Okay  so...\nSo that's— Let's say that's\nan average challenge. That took us how long? About 45 minutes.\nAbout 45 minutes  okay. In Maastricht \nif we want to get back to either Brussels or Cologne...\nMhm. ...by the end of the day \nwe're not gonna have 45 minutes. How long do we have?\nI think about 30. 30 to 40  depending on whether\nwe go to Brussels or Cologne. I am furious with myself for missing the camera shot of me choking that waffle\nand those violets down. There'll be many\nmissed camera shots. (sighs) So  just gonna say\na thing  Tom. This train does go to Aachen\nvia the Netherlands. Yes  it does.\nJust to say that an option... is to auto-claim the Netherlands... and just stay on this train\nand go to Germany. They have to call us\nif they fail the challenge as well  right?\nYeah. So I think the only scenario \nwhich you maybe wanna consider that  is if they do fail.\nYes. (whispers) That looks like\nBlack Forest cake. That's gotta be Black Forest cake. What bakery are you looking at? \"Backert\"-Konditorei. Yeah  that does look\nlike potentially it. My worry is like \nwhat if it's closed  and they just didn't update it because of the Epiphany? Right. Yeah  a bunch of stuff\nseems to be closed today... in Germany. So... we might be screwed. So we have entered\nthe Black Forest region. We just nicked it\nabout 45 seconds ago. Okay. So... Got a half an hour\nto find this cake... ...and eat it too. We'll get off\nat the next stop. Which is only in a few minutes. We'll have 25 minutes to\ntry to find this cake and eat it. Well  the thing that we\nneed to figure out now  Tom... And this is a much bigger decision\nMhm. is where are we\ngoing tomorrow morning? Yeah.\nAre we going to Copenhagen? Are we going to Nice?\nAre we going to Vienna? And the real decision... If we wanna go to Vienna \nwe want go to Cologne tonight. If we want to go to\nNice or Copenhagen  we want to go to Brussels. The thing is  if we knew... that they were not\ngoing to Vienna... Would we go? I think the answer\nwould be yes. It would be silly not to. 'Cause we can get three \nmaybe four countries. The thing is—\nWe just— We don't want to have\na fight on our hands. But here's the thing. If we do have a fight  it's because\nthey haven't gone to... Liechtenstein and Austria. And there isn't\nanywhere else on the map where we can go and\nget that much stuff. Mhm.\nYeah. Starting to look Dutch.\nI was just thinking that. Long skinny houses.\nYep. Oh  yep  that's us.\nAre we past the border? Yep. Welcome to the Netherlands. Welcome to the Netherlands. 3-2 with a country locked. Let's get some cake. Okay  you know\nwhere the bakery is? They've claimed\nthe Netherlands  Ben. Claimed the Netherlands  okay. Good for you guys. Figured as much. It'd be interesting to see\nif they can lock it  I suppose. Yeah  so the bakery is\nright next to the train station. If it's not open \nthen we start to panic. Great. Sounds like a good plan. Alright  Ben  we've got... 24 and a half minutes\nto get this cake. How do we get\nto the other side? I believe that's it.\nThat's it. It looks open  potentially.\nIt looks... The lights are on. Cake  cake  cake. Oh  there's somebody in there.\nOkay  good. Good  good  good. Okay  they're open. Let's just hope they've\ngot Black Forest. Hi.\nOh. Uh-oh. Doesn't look like it. Do you have Black Forest cake? (indistinct) Do you have this? Nein.\nNo. Okay. No. Okay  that's really bad. Okay. Plan part two: panic. So to get to Cologne\nby the end of the day... Mhm. We need to leave\nMaastricht at 3:23. Alright  what time\ndo we get into Maastricht? 2:43. 2:43  that's\n40 minutes on the nose. We have a shot. So we have exactly\n40 minutes in Maastricht... (both giggle) to try the Netherlands challenge.\nYeah. Let's do it. You're gonna be really annoyed\nif this involves eating something. Is there anything else open?\nI'm looking. Okay  there's a different bakery... ...this way. There's also a restaurant\nopen called I Love Burger. Yeah  I don't think\nthat's gonna do it. Super closed.\nSuper duper closed. Okay  we should see\nif there's anything in the convenience store  Ben. At the train station?\nAt the train station. It's not over yet.\nIt's not over yet. We still have 19 minutes.\nOkay. Nope  it's closed. Closed. Okay. Okay. What about in here? I don't think so. Rather sparse offerings here. Okay  we need\nto do some research. Maybe something else at that bakery is\nnamed after the region. You never know. Black Forest ham? Is there any chance\nthat we could get Black Forest ham somewhere? There's a butcher shop \nbut it's closed. I see a butcher shop\nthat's open. It also looks like it might have... Let's just start walking here.\nOkay  okay. Because this is towards\nthe other stuff anyway. Okay. Let's go.\nAlright. 40 minutes\nuntil our train goes. Welcome—\nBuild Jason his dream bouquet. Build Jason his dream bouquet. The Netherlands are\nknown for many things. It's not just bikes. Indeed  the Netherlands are\nthe flower shop of the world. So please assemble the bouquet\nof Jason from Not Just Bikes' dreams to his precise specifications. Complete and send Jason\na picture of your bouquet within 30 minutes \nor you fail this challenge. Your time starts the next\ntime you touch a flower. You may not do any research \nflower acquisition  or assembly until then. Jason's specifications\nare on our phones. So our time starts\nwhen we touch a flower  but it doesn't matter because we've gotta be out here\nin 40 minutes anyway  right? Yeah  so are you getting\nhis bouquet specifications? Yeah  I'm getting those now.\nSurely they're orange. You would think so? That's a fancy website. Yeah  well done  Amy.\nOh god  it's a video. Oh god.\n(groans) Alright  so the minute\nwe have to touch a flower to start this. Are any of these fruits\ntechnically botanical flowers? They're flowers. Those are fruits.\nThose are not flowers. Nope  flowers. Oh  there's\nflowers here  alright. But they're pre-made bouquets.\nYou ready? 30 minute starts... now. Welkom in Nederland. Thanks for helping me out here.\nWe should go out for this. I've always\nwanted a flower bouquet with at least six carnations\nin three different colors  two Orange Gerberas \na Christmas Rose  and an Alstroemeria \nand all filled out with some Mimosa. And while I could make this myself \nI'd much rather that you did it. Good luck! We need to find a flower shop. Simple as that.\nWe need to find a flower shop. You look for a \"shower flop\". I'll try to look what these are.\nYeah  I'm on it  I'm on it. Hopefully we can just\ngive those to a florist. Bloemen & Planten. That way  let's go. Okay. How far is it  Tom?\nNot far at all. Hang on  hang on \nhang on  hang on. Sorry. The compass was off\nby 90 degrees! Alright  we're\ntwo minutes away  so there's a shot. Ooh  what's this?\nIt's an ice cream place. It looks like it has\nsome kind of cake. That is cake. Is that Black Forest cake?\nThose are cherries. That's Black Forest cake.\nThat's Black Forest cake. Yeah.\nOkay. We need to get that. One of these. Here? No  no. Yes  yes. Right  that's definitely\nBlack Forest cake. 100— 110%. Adam  I know my cakes. We gotta get it to the\nBlack Forest though. Here  do you have\na credit card on you? Mine are buried in my backpack. No cash? Cash?\nCash? Oh no. Ha.\nShoot  okay  let's see. Where can we get\nGerman money? Okay  it says there's\nan ATM really close by. But it might be in\na place that's closed. (bleep) Yeah  it's inside one\nof these buildings. Oh  that is not a—\noh  we'll see. We'll see. I don't see any other florists\nor anything 'round here. There are no other\nflorists in this town. Oh wow.\nThis is our only hope. Let's see what we\ncan get here  and then... Alright  do you wanna\nput the camera down just to... Yeah  I'll speak. Hello? Do you speak English?\nYes  absolutely. We have instructions\nfor a bouquet. We are doing a game  and we have to find\na bouquet like that. Not everything. I have only\nthe Orange Gerbaras. Uh-huh. Christmas Rose is Finnish.\nAhh. Alstroemeria \nI don't have that. Okay.\nNot now  and not anymore. And Mimosas \nnot from this time. Alright. We have been given\na duff challenge I think. Christmas Rose \nthat's just seasonal? Christmas  yeah  okay.\nSo nowhere will have it? Yeah  that's over\nfrom the Christmas time. Mm  right.\nBut  it's Finnish. Mimosa's only one month a year.\nRight. I mean  let's get what we can.\nOnly this? Yeah.\nYeah  so... Yeah  let's get what we can. Oh  wonderful. All together?\nAll together. Yeah.\nLike this? That will do.\nThank you. Thank you.\nPaying together? Do you take debit card? We have a card. Money order service. It says it's open.\nThis? Yeah  yeah  yeah.\nHere we go  here we go. Yep  yep  yep. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.\nWe still got nine minutes  Ben. They're having trouble\nwith our change. Okay  start looking up how we can—\nI'm trying to figure out. I have no service.\nI understand  I understand. I'm working on it.\nI'm working on it too. Yeah  we can just\ngo straight across. Five minutes. Danke. Guten Tag. Let's kick it.\nAlright. Okay. So  yeah  it's this way. Okay. 'Cause technically\nwe're just outside of the Black Forest\nregion right now. Actually  might be closer\nthan I want it to be. It's gonna be tight  actually.\nIt's gonna be very tight. Here's the deal.\nWe have five and a half minutes  and we have to get up to here. Is your knee okay?\nNo. Okay. We'll be fine.\nOkay  okay. It is okay.\nAll good. Thank you very much.\nDankjewel. Here's the thing.\nYep. If we can't get\nChristmas Rose... Yep— They can't get\nChristmas Rose. (laughs ecstatically) Ben  Adam. If you somehow come\nto the Netherlands and you are able to find plants\nthat are not in season from an actual florist...\nYeah. Honestly  they kinda\ndeserve that at that point. Well  at the very least  the one thing that I almost\nsort of like about this is that they don't know\nwhy this is failable. Yes. Yeah they don't.\nUntil they do. So they might be coaxed\nto come to the Netherlands with something that—\nIt sounds like it's not impossible. Some flower shops might\nstill have Christmas Rose. Yeah. But it's a—\nIt's for Christmas. Yeah.\nAnd it's now not Christmas. Ohh! Well  here's the thing.\nWe have time. Please send this to\nNot Just Bikes for his approval.\nThe instruction was to send— It was to text it him\nfor his approval. That's in the challenge. Alright  just up there. Ben  take the cake \ntake the cake. The cake.\nTake the cake. Give me the cake.\nTake the cake. Eat the cake. There we go.\nAh. With two minutes\nand 15 seconds to spare. Germany... locked. Wow  that was—\nFuck you  Sam and Tom. You thought you could\nget Germany today? Wrong. Wrong. Pretty good. It's pretty good. Let's call 'em.\nShout out Black Forest. I've lost my challenge card.\nHang on  where'd it go? We're getting a call.\nOh  oh. Wait  wait. Hide— hide these. Hello.\nHello. Gentlemen  we're\nthrilled to announce that we have locked\nthe wonderful country of Germany by eating this delicious\nBlack Forest cake in the Black Forest region. Felicitaciones. Good luck with the Netherlands. Oh  we're J-chillin. Dankjewel. Bye.\nBye. Let's go steal France.\nYep. We're failing the challenge.\nMight as well. But let's at least\nsend him a message. Should we let him know? I suppose  I mean \ndo we want to double check that Albert Heijn\nthat had some flowers? Let's double check it \nbut I think we're good. Just for the sake of...\nYeah. Okay  Tom \nthis is our decision point. Theoretically  we could\ntake a train back to... ...Brussels right now.\nRight. The thing is from Brussels  the flights to Vienna\nare much more expensive. Oh  then no \nlet's do Cologne. That's... Yeah.\nYeah. We're good. So  I mean \nthe thing is they can— They will be able to see that the cheapest\nflight to Vienna... Yeah.\nis from Cologne. Maybe they figure it out\nfrom that. I don't know. Yeah. And even if they do  I don't know if it's\nthe end of the world. You know what?\nWhy don't we leave it to them? They get to choose whether\nthey want the fight or not. Yeah.\nRight now... No  we're the alphas  Tom.\nWhat are we scoring? We're scoring three.\nYeah. We're scoring\nthree with one locked. They're on two with one locked?\nYeah. No.\nWe're the alphas. Then... Firstly  I hate that. But second... Let's bring the fight to them. You don't like exuding\nalpha male energy  Tom? I... ...don't have a response\nto that that's printable. Wow  that's crazy\nthat it was that close. We like to keep\nthings exciting here. Good news is... we are close to Basel. Yeah  yeah. And Basel is close to France. Yeah  so what\nwe need to do now is figure out  you know...\nWe know how to get to Basel easily. How can we get from Basel\nactually over the French border  so that we can go ahead\nand try to steal France? The key thing is  this France steal is\ngonna be what determines if the day went better for us\nor went better for them. Okay  but here's\nthe good news  Sam. Yes? We don't have to\ngo to Germany. But I think we are\ngoing to Germany. We are. But we have no stress now about whether we're gonna\nmanage to get to Cologne in time to do a challenge.\nWell  yes. Or anything like we don't— With the small exception of\nwe have to take Deutsche Bahn to get there  but...\nOkay  yes  fair. But... Assuming perhaps optimistically\nthat Deutsche Bahn works... I don't know if\nyou want me to say this  but this route to Cologne does involve a\nsix-minute connection. Oh  now you tell me! But the good news is...\nOn Deutsche Bahn? if we miss that connection \nwe're not fully screwed. It just becomes close for comfort.\nAlright. We know we've almost\ncertainly failed the challenge  but do you wanna check\nthe Albert Heijn? I'll take the flowers.\nMight as well  yeah. You've got the list.\nOkay. Go on in.\nI'll see you in a minute. I'll take this.\nYep. Okay  I am looking\nfor one of these guys. Definitely not. No dice. No good.\nNo good? No good  no Christmas Roses.\nNo good. Alright  well... That's the game. We are playing a game  and we had to go\nand get some flowers. And unfortunately we have\nfailed the challenge. Would you like some flowers? Yes.\nHappy New Year. Happy New Year. There you go.\nThank you. Have a good one.\nAlright  we gotta dash. Have a good day. Alright  so  bad news:\nchallenge failed comprehensively. There is not another florist within half an hour.\nCannot be done. At least according\nto that florist who seemed very trustworthy. And was also the only one\nopen in Maastricht. So  that's the bad news. The good news is we think the challenge\nis actually impossible. I don't think it matters\nthat we failed this. What matters is—\nNo  it could even be good. If they come to Netherlands\nand attempt this and waste all that time and...\nYeah. Let's give 'em a call.\nLet's give 'em a call. But here's the thing  Tom. We gotta look really disappointed.\nYes. I know that we're not\nthat disappointed  but like... Yep. We gotta act. Oh  they're calling. Gentlemen.\nHello. Hello. Gentlemen  lads. Netherlands is failed. Ooh.\nWe did not succeed at the Dutch challenge. But we still have the country.\nIt is still on the board for— Yes  yes  for now.\nCertainly for now. Thank you...\nAnyway. for this very interesting\nupdate  gentlemen. Very interesting update.\nGood bye. Good bye  Sam.\nGood bye Tom. Well  unsurprisingly \nthey looked delighted. The die is cast.\nThey're gonna go for it. They're absolutely\ngonna go for it. Ohh  baby! That could dictate\nhow we play tomorrow. ♪ Bee-bop-bop ba-dap-bop ♪ Actually  my\nimmediate thought is we shouldn't try to deal\nwith the Netherlands 'cause it's gonna be annoying\nto get there from where we are. And now that they've failed it \nthey can never reattempt. So for the next five days \nthe Netherlands is sitting there waiting to be stolen. And I think that if there's a day where we don't have\nanother good option  there are frequent\nflights to Amsterdam  and we just go and we grab it. That's my take.\nNo  I agree. We don't need to\nsteal it right away. We do want to try and\nsteal it eventually  but... the map is still very open. Right  and I\nreally want to make sure we get Austria\nbefore they get there. I will say that we're\non Deutsche Bahn now  which would explain\nwhy this train is late. And why there\nare random explosions. Yeah. Our train comes in three minutes.\nOkay. Good luck. Should we get a train? Let's get the train. (laughs gleefully) Alright. Check the platform. Oh  yeah  which platform?\nWe need to go to... Don't tell me\nit's the Aachen one. Oh  it's gonna be the Aachen one.\nOh no. It's gonna be the—\nOh no! It is the Aachen one. Cancelled due to\nlimited rolling stock. Well  how else are we\ngetting to Aachen in time? The next one's cancelled as well. Wait  wait  wait. Do we... Wait  we have time to get\non a train to Brussels. Then get on a train to Brussels. But then we'll have to... We'll have to spend a (bleep)-load\nto get that flight to Vienna. I'm sorry.\nWe have to go to Brussels. It's the only option.\nI guess. It's literally the only option.\nIt's the next one too. Yeah  where...? I think it's the Liège one.\nLet me double check. I'm not even certain that the connections will\nwork right  but I'll... Well  can you see\nany other way to go? No  I mean \nLiège is the right answer  'cause then we're on\na high-speed line. Yeah. There's our train on the left. Back the way we came then?\nI suppose. I need to research whether\nthere is a connection. Well  what if there isn't? (sputters) Cool! Cool  cool  cool.

        "transcript": "Welcome to episode two of our race to claim\nthe most countries in Europe. Last episode  Tom and I\ntook the Eurostar route  claiming France  Belgium \nand the Netherlands. Though we only\nsuccessfully completed the challenge to lock Belgium \nleaving France and the Netherlands vulnerable to a steal. Meanwhile  we thought\nBen and Adam would fly to Vienna to claim this group of four  but they surprised us by\nflying to Zurich  Switzerland and beating us to Germany\nby only a few minutes. Now they're on their way to France \nhoping to steal it from us. We weren't too worried about that\nbecause we had a great plan to fly to Vienna in the morning. But our train at Cologne Airport\nwas canceled  so we had to scramble\nand go back to Brussels where there's a later \nmore expensive flight. If we can even make\nit there in time. Back the way we came  then? I suppose. I just—\nI need to research whether there is a connection. What if there isn't? (sputters) Cool! Cool  cool  cool. No  it's recommending\nthat we go via Aachen  which is not possible.\nIt should— Look at that route.\nThat's the most efficient route to Brussels Airport. I don't know why. 'Cause earlier\nit seemed to show me... I'm sure there's—\nNow  there's a route  yeah. Yeah  there's a 4:31\nto Brussels Central. Alright. (sighs) I need a shot of your face and the train everything \njust like  \"You got Deutsche Bahn'd!\" It's really impressive\nconsidering... we didn't even go into Germany. We still got Deutsche Bahn'd.\nYeah. Yeah. I'm not saying we're going slowly... but we are about to be\novertaken by a bicycle. Yeah  it's tough. (wheezes softly) They're still not\ngoing to Basel  but... Why not? Are they having\ntrain problems as well? Certainly possible.\nI mean  they're in Germany. Adam  Ben  I'm not certain  but maybe you just got\nDeutsche Bahn'd. Maybe you just got\nDeutsche Bahn'd. Hey Ben. Deutsche Bahn canceled our train. This is shocking. This is a shocking\ndevelopment to me. You know  a huge strat\nin this game should be to avoid\nGermany entirely. Now the good news\nis that there is supposedly another train\nin 15 minutes. So it should...\ntheoretically be fine. We heard a large explosion \nand then they just took our— They just made the train\ndisappear off the board. So I wouldn't say\nthat it's a good sign. Okay  so if they're\ngoing to Basel... there is Basel Mulhouse\nFreiburg Airport  I think it's called  the...\nMhm. But that one. And is there a Vienna flight\noutta that tomorrow? The 10:10 Austrian to Vienna. What time does it arrive?\n11:40. What time would our flight\narrive from Brussels? (snickers)\nWe would get in at 11:35. (laughs)\nFive minutes earlier! But it doesn't—\nIt's not the schedule. It's wheels down time.\nIt's wheels down time. It came. Gonna be late  but it came. Whew. Well  I do think we're gonna\nbe able to steal France. Well  if we succeed. I think that we are gonna be able\nto give it the old college try. Alright  Sam \nwe are nearly back in Liège. What are the lads doing? They're... on\nthe line west to Basel as I thought they'd be.\nAlright. I'm not convinced that's\na good strategy for them? I mean  they're not in any sort of advantageous\nposition to us  as far as we can tell. Of course they have the chance\nto pick up France. Which  that's significant. Yeah. Oh  I wanna steal France. It would be— Imagine  imagine that\nthey take the Eurostar  and we end up with\nFrance and Germany on the first day. Ridiculous.\nRidiculous. It's unheard of. And it's like \nthey just left that open. Yeah. 'Cause the thing\nabout a steal  as of course you know  because you the audience\nare very smart... A steal is a two-point swing. It takes a point away from them \nand it adds a point to us. So it's functionally worth the same\nas getting two countries. Yep. It's 3-2 now  but it could be 3-2\nthe other way. Yeah. But if we blow it  then... they'll have won the day. I don't see that happening. Smile at the window. So good. There's a departure board.\nI think that's a bus schedule. That's the departure board. Mulhouse  track 33. Look how French it is. There he is. (whispers)\nHe's asking you to be quiet. I hate him. (whispers) We hate him.\nBut we have to be quiet. He's asking  he's saying\nwe have to be quiet. Shhhh. Are they doing\nsomething weird  Tom? Or why are you looking like that? There is a train to Saint-Louis[sahn-loo-ee]\nin three minutes for them. Mhm.\nFrom platform 33? Lot of platforms. In theory \nthey could get that... and try and get France tonight.\nBut they'll have to get a move on. Here we go  Ben. Finally leaving...\nOff to France. Leaving five minutes late. Thank you  SNCF. So they're going back to...\nThey're going back to Brussels. Yes  which is\nvery surprising to us. We're trying to figure out why. Yeah. We thought they should've\ngone down to Luxembourg. 'Cause they\ncould get Luxembourg  but like they're like... maybe there's a really good flight\nout of Brussels in the morning  but we can't find anything. No  I mean it seems\nlike the best flight out of Brussels is to Vienna. But we would beat them to Austria\ntomorrow morning. And there's an okay flight\nto Copenhagen  but it's not a slam dunk. You're also just gonna\nbe wasting time in Brussels. 'Cause you're in Belgium \na country you've already locked. Yeah  they're just\nsitting around in Belgium. I don't know.\nI don't know  man. I don't know what they're doing. Man  this is a slow train. Yeah  it's crawling\nalong into France. It's alright. It's alright. And they are entering France. I really hope they\nstuff up the challenge. I really  really hope they\nstuff up the challenge. It'd be very  very useful for us. Alright  buddy. Well  we've made it to France. (sighs) Oh man \nI hope that this works. Yeah. Otherwise  we just\nwasted so much time. Okay.\nAlright  let's do it. Let's hurry up. Welcome to Saint Louis[seint loo-is]. Let's get out\nin front of the station in case we gotta run\nto a business or such. I'm excited to see the arch. Alright  they are in Saint-Louis[san loo-ee]. Okay. So we should expect\ntheir challenge soon. Okay  hello.\nWe have made it to France. A vulnerable country. It's very vulnerable here. It is controlled by\nthe tyrannical Tom and Sam  but we are here to liberate it. We're gonna go ahead\nand open this. Let's hope we can do this one. Open an unpopular museum. The Louvre in Paris is the most\npopular museum in the world. In this challenge \nyou must create the least popular. Go to any museum \nthen spend 20 minutes recreating three things\nthat are there. Mark an area of four by four feet\nand place your three objects and a sign with the name\nof your museum inside. This is your new museum. In the next 10 minutes \nif any stranger spends more than five seconds\nin your museum  you fail. At least five strangers must\nvisit and leave your museum during the 10 minutes \nor you must start over. The museum you visit may be\nout of the country  but your museum\nmust be in France. Okay.\nOkay. It seems as though there is\nsomething called the Pocket Museum  which is open 24 hours because it's just a little window. Okay. It's actually\nback in Switzerland. Okay.\nWe can take the tram there. We can get there\nbefore the day is out. We'll take the next tram.\nWe can get there... We'll basically end the day\nat the museum. The annoying thing is\nwe're gonna have to— we have to go into Switzerland\nand we have to go back into France. Right  'cause\nwe have to actually do the challenge\nin the country. So  but that's fine. This is  look  it's not the\neasiest challenge in the world. No  I think we can do it.\nWe could get screwed  but there's no time limit. We can take our time.\nYeah. And I think we can do it. This is true.\nI think we can do it. I think we can make a museum that people do not give\na (bleep) about at all. Okay  well  let's go\nto the Pocket Museum. Let's get on the tram. We're having so much fun\non the tram. Okay.\nOkay. There's nothing more\nwe can do tonight other than wait for that call.\nExcept for— Except for pick the flight. Our options are still\nVienna or Nice. If they're taking\na flight out of Basel  they're taking this flight. And if they're taking this flight  I think we want to\ntake the flight. Yeah  I agree. Because we want to\nfight over those countries  so that at best— And if they're not\ntaking that flight... we've got the...\nRight. Either the best or the\nsecond best bit on the board. Right.\nWith no competition  or... The— Yeah  it's the only— Book the flight. Book the flight.\nBook the flight. Yeah.\nYeah. $784. (growls) That's more than I want.\nBut that's... It's 20%.\nslightly less than a fifth of our total budget.\n(sighs) Yep. And we didn't spend any today. Call it. We're going to Vienna. Tomorrow is going to be... Interesting? A fight over... What do you call that region? I mean  I can't call it\nthe fight over Austria-Hungary. (laughs) That's... We had a couple of those \nyou know? Yeah. Let's a-go.\nOkay. Ben  welcome\nto the Pocket Museum. Oh  it's so cute. Look at that. In many ways \nit's one of the cutest things I've ever seen in my whole life. So he is rolling up\na little present it would seem.\nMhm. They're doing surgery.\nAh-huh. Which is dark. What's happening in this one?\nUh-oh. This one's very dark. That one's spooky. Oh no  that elf is dead. I think that this is murder. Five  four  three  two  See you tomorrow  folks.\none. Happy rest period  Tom. (exhales deeply)\nWe made it through day one. Well  Ben  the day has ended. Tomorrow morning \nI think we can finalize what we're gonna do here.\nOkay  good night. Good night.\n(smooches) Okay  now it's time\nfor the first rest period. Each day at 5:30 pm\nCentral European Time  gameplay stops so that\nplayers can sleep  shower  and consume as many\ncalories as possible. Gameplay resumes from\nthe exact same point at 7:30 am Central European Time\nthe next morning. And so without further ado \nhere is day two. Day two.\nGood morning. We're going to Vienna.\nWe think they're going to Vienna. Let's get on a train.\nLet's do it. Oh! Alright. Brussels Airport. Platform three. Uhh  yeah.\nHere we go. Great timing. Not that we're in\nmuch of a rush  but... True  but we might as well. Good morning.\nGood morning. Everyone seems to be asleep\nhere in wonderful Basel. But not us.\nNot us. We are awake here. We're awake  and we're\nat the Hoosesagg Museum. Unfortunately  we need to pick the three most boring\nthings from here. That's true.\nAnd recreate them. Make a wrapping paper? And a fork. I mean \ndoes this branch count? Are these branch—\nThese are a thing in there. They are a thing in there. There are a lot of objects\nthat we can recreate. Yeah. We need to figure out\nwhere we're going to build our little museum. There's a couple of options  right?\nWe could go— 'cause we've gotta get back\nover the French border. So we could go back to\nthat train station we were at. There's also the airport\nright over the border. Oh  look at this. People are throwing out\ntheir Christmas tree. So maybe we just... Perfect.\nWe've done it. Train station or airport? Where should we build\nour museum? Let's try the train station.\nOkay. 'Cause I'm not confident\nabout the airport. Where are Sam and Tom\nthis morning? Can now see why\nour game day is so short. Because despite a\n14 hour overnight  I can't see anything out there.\nit's still pitch black. But the sun will rise soon. Hopefully. If it doesn't  we're in\nbig  bigger trouble than... Yeah. But at least probably equal\nchallenges for both teams. Eyes peeled. This kiosk is open  Ben. See if there's anything. You know what we could do?\nWe could take one of these. Uh-huh.\nOh  that looks like wrapping paper. And sort of recreate\nthe roll of wrapping paper Yeah  I like that.\nthe little gnomes had. Okay  let's get that. Thank you. Alright  let's go get on the tram. Where are Sam and Tom? We just have to see... Yeah.\nwhen they go to the airport. If they go to the airport.\nI am... Surely they're\ngoing to the airport. Welcome to\nBrussels Airport  Tom. Before you go up...\nYeah? Curious for your opinion. Are humans animals? What? I wanted to get\nyour opinion on a card. Touch an animal\nthat's not a pet. Humans are animals  right? Humans are animals. God damnit!\nIt's probably our oversight. No  it's just\na simple question. Are humans animals? I'm not getting involved. (scoffs) Seems like\na pretty simple question. And yet! Welcome back to Saint Louis. Saint Louis.\nI can't wait to have some ribs. So we need one more item. Yes.\nThat matches the museum. And then we need to figure out\nwhere we're gonna make our museum. I will just say right here.\nYep  right here  pretty good. There are people walking in. And I don't think\nthat they are stopping. They're not stopping.\nRight  like this. This whole corridor.\nRight  this whole corridor. Nobody would stop in here. Right  there's no reason to. There's simply no reason to. There's the mini-mart. We're gonna poke around\nin the Relay. This is exactly the kind\nof thing that was in there. Or actually  look at this. This is even closer to\none of those key chains. And it's tiny.\nAnd it's tiny. If we can rip it off the pen. Yeah  we can\nrip it off the pen. Love that. Perfect. Merci. Okay. We've acquired our items. I think we've done\nreally good work. The real key to this challenge is just picking the right spot\nfor the museum. I feel like\nI have the perfect idea. I believe that our museum\nshould go in here. It's just like the little window That's true.\nof our museum. The only question is \nare we at all worried that people won't walk\nclose enough to the wall? Maybe. Maybe... I can observe the doorways. The doorways are more narrow. People are more guaranteed\nto walk through them. If we put the museum right here... Yeah  okay. I buy that. Because also nobody would\nwait around in a doorway. It's very rude. This is gonna go great. Okay. The doorway's really smart. Hello  welcome to the installation\nof the Pocket Pocket Museum. Our first piece is\nthis wrapping paper. Our second piece \nthis beautiful pine needle. And our third piece\nis this key chain. And finally our sign. There  that's beautiful. That's the Pocket Pocket Museum. That extends four feet. One  two  three  four  and then this line\nto there  four back. It's basically if you\nwalk through the doorway  you've been to the museum.\nYep. Here's the deal. When we open the museum \nit will be open for 10 minutes. We have to have five people\ngo to the museum  which just means to walk past it. If anybody stops at the museum\nfor longer than five seconds... Then we lose.\nThen we lose. But I don't think they will. I think we've been\nvery smart about this. I think that our museum is\ngoing to be a huge failure and thus a massive success. Happy Christmas  Tom. Oh  it's the Tintin... Oh yeah.\n...rocket. Sorry  I should\nprobably be saying more  but I've got nothing. Instead I'll just take the camera\nand point it back at you. Oh yeah  I think. Okay.\nMuseum. Are we ready?\nYep. The museum is now open. One. She did not... She did not like\nthe museum very much. Oh  this woman's going. Is she rushing\nto see the museum? No. Alas  she hated the museum. That is two. He's going right through. This is working just beautifully. People do not like\nthe museum at all. Two more guests\nfor our museum. Will they stop and enjoy it? Alright  that's five.\nSo that's— We've hit our minimum. Now we just have to wait\nanother nine minutes and make sure that no one\nactually stops in the doorway. But why would anyone\nstop in the doorway  Ben? How rude would they be?\nNo one would stop in the way. But if anyone stops in that doorway\nin the next nine minutes for longer than five seconds  we do not steal France.\nNo. And these are\nthe kind of stakes we're dealing with out here. In Saint Louis of all places. I could see in their minds\nan overarching strategy being... Sweep up behind us.\nYes. And I was thinking before on whether or not that's\na viable strategy. But I think the trickiness of it is  effectively what happened\nin the Netherlands is that the fact that\nwe have failed a challenge means it is challenging. And therefore...\nYeah. You spend all that time\ngoing somewhere. And maybe you still have\na greater than 50% chance. But even that  you know  one third of the time\nwhen you fail and you spend all that budget and\ntime going there  that's pretty impactful.\nYeah. There's the\nadvantage of being first in terms of you're more likely\nto end up with the country  'cause you get  you claim\nit in the first place  and then you have first\npass on the challenge. But there is the advantage\nof coming in second  in which that's not\na one-point swing  that's a two-point swing. And I think it's impossible\nfor us to know now No.\nwhich strategy's better. We're gonna find out. He's in there  and he's out. They're in there... and they're out. I want France so bad. I know  buddy  I know.\nSeven more minutes. Seven more minutes.\nOkay. You would never\nstop in the doorway. You would never stop\nin the doorway. No  you would never \nyou would never. Hi.\nHello. No way.\nHow's it going? You absolutely can \nas long as you don't spend more than five seconds\nin that doorway. Just we're begging you not\nto spend more than five seconds in that doorway. Good to meet you. Good luck to you guys. Thank you.\nThank you  thank you. Alright  see  that was fine. But what if she had noticed us\nwhile she was in the doorway? I know  I was gonna say. Legit  if she had done that\n10 feet that way  we would've been screwed. What time are we at? We're at six minutes. I have bad news  which is that the museum\nhas been open— Oh my god.\nNo— Gotta go through.\nWhoop  yep. (wheezes)\n(hyperventilates) Okay  we're good \nwe're good. See  that was also very scary\nbecause they hugged. Two minutes left. Don't stand there. What if somebody stops and\nlooks at you or something? Okay  one minute left  Ben.\nOne minute left. Man  I am so nervous. I'm some of the most scared\nI've ever been in my whole life. Okay  he's going through.\nHe's moving at a nice brisk... One  two  three  four  oh my god. I almost just threw up. That was the scariest thing that's ever happened\nin my whole life. Five  four  three  two  one. We're good. Oh my god \nit got testy there. Oh my god. Okay. Yeah  clear out the\nPocket Pocket Museum. We'll go ahead and\ninstall this somewhere else. I think up here \nit says C and D. Yeah  yeah. Let's get on this train.\nOkay. Let's call Sam and Tom \nshall we? Hello gentlemen. Hello.\nHello. I am afraid to inform you that we have wrested\nFrance from your grasp. Hmm. Yeah. We opened a museum \nand it was a huge failure. But in its failure \nit was a massive success. Congratulations.\nGood bye. Good bye.\nGood bye. (whispers) Oh my god. Alright  Adam  where to next? It's time to go to\nthe wonderful country of Austria  I think.\nI think so. Alright  well \nthat means it is 3-2 to them. That's the bad news. You know what I just noticed?\nThe good news is... Yeah  you were looking\nat the map? Well they were— That was a train that\nthey were on  right? It was some form of transit. I was trying to figure out\nwhether it was a bus  but I'm pretty sure it's a train. And they're on the move. But that's not the way\nyou get to Basel Airport. I checked. The way\nyou get to Basel Airport is by a bus from there. Are they not doing Vienna? If they're not doing Vienna—\nBut why would they not be? The same reason they\nweren't doing it yesterday. Maybe they've spotted something. Look  there's a rainbow.\nThere's a rainbow. Oh  look at that. Who-ho-hoa! It's— There's a\nlittle rainbow in France because it is—\nTo celebrate its liberation. Here's the thing. We can get to the\nSwiss-Austrian border seven minutes before their plane\nwould land. Yep. I don't know that\nwe can cross the border within seven minutes. We can look into it.\nYeah  we can look into that. There is a bridge\nkind of near there. My opinion is that\neven if they beat us to Austria  it would be good\nto be near Austria because they—\nwe can be there doing the challenge\nat the same time as them. Yeah.\nSo we could certainly be a— Even if they claim it first  we could be a strong\ncontender to steal it. Because they would have to get\nthree miles from the airport before they can even\nopen the challenge. Right  so we could actually\nprobably start the challenge first. Before them. I also don't even think\nthey're gonna go to Vienna. They might not.\nThey very well may not. I think they should know\nit's too much of a risk. Are they gonna try and\npull a train across Switzerland to get to Austria before us? But they can't. We're gonna be there\nin two hours. You say they can't. It's physics. I don't get it. And that's worrying. Off... to the\nAustrian border then. They're going east.\nYep. The most relevant question is can they beat us\nby train to Austria? I don't think so. Because we'll be there\nin about two hours. Uh-huh.\nIf all goes well. The fastest route\nthat I can find off of  you know  admittedly\ntwo minutes of research... would take... Hmm. I don't like that \"Hmm\". Two— Two hours and 45 minutes. Seems like the border town\nis St Margrethen. If they left on this train  which sure looks like\nthey left on that train... Yep. They would get\ninto the border town  which is still in Switzerland \nat 11:43. What time do we land?\n11:40. But  keep in mind... this is not... From there  they would have\nto go on foot or something... to get into—\nThat's not far  Sam. It's not far.\nThat's really not far! It could be possible. And if our flight is\ndelayed a little bit  they could get it.\nBut our plane's right there  Tom. What could go wrong? (exhales shakily) You... nnngh. They're at the airport\nright now. Can you see\nwhat gate they're at? It's  I mean... you never know with these things\nhow accurate it is. But it looks like they're\nat a gate in the mid A50— like A51  A53  A54  A52. 9:50 to Vienna is boarding. It's at gate A51. Sam  I really do not like how fast they're getting east. It's a high-speed line. Does it stop being\nhigh-speed at some point? Yes.\nOkay. After Zurich.\nI just  I... 'Cause if they can\njust pop into Austria  even if we get it first \nthey're in position to a challenge. We gotta get outta the airport.\nYeah. We can't do a challenge within three miles\nof an airport  right? Yeah  but also  yeah. (grumbles) But as far as— Twice  twice they've\nsurprised us in two days. Yeah. They're out on the tarmac. I think they're definitely\ngoing to Vienna. Okay. We are going to get\nto Zurich in 10 minutes. Let's go to St Margrethen. We walk over the border\ninto Höchst and we try and steal it. Yeah? (whispers) I think so. I think so. I think so. Alright. There's a train at 10:03\nin three minutes. What platform? That goes to Rorschach\non platform 33. And we need to make that\nto get to the Austrian border. Yep. Oh man. And that should be\nno problem at all. It's gonna be so easy.\nNot even close. Not even close. Doing it all with flight radar?\nYep. Well if their plane\ngets delayed even like 15 minutes... could be huge for us. 'Cause then we might be able to\nactually claim Austria first. Yeah. Okay. Platform 33. Here we go  buddy.\nThat's the train to Rorschach. Okay.\nYep. Come on.\nOh  beautiful. Just in time. Oh  the door literally\nclosed on me. What's it look like? It looks like\ntheir flight is taking off. I think that's what it means when the line turns\nfrom white to yellow. I think that might be the\nprettiest takeoff I've ever seen. That was stunning! (sighs) Alright. First to Austria wins. Er  a point. But first to Austria wins a point that can then be stolen\nby the other team. But you know what I mean. And it took off\n17 minutes after scheduled. Which is actually...\nIt's pretty good. Pretty good.\nYeah. It makes me worried that\nthey're gonna get in even earlier. Yeah  me too. It's kind of fun\nto be in a frantic race to the Austrian border \nbut here we are. Having a little...\n(cups clink) you know... espresso. With a tablecloth. I know. Look at that. That's a... That's a damn tablecloth. My opinion is that our show \nmore than anything  is an advertisement for Eurail.\nYeah. Okay  Tom  so... I think I've identified the exact route they're on. Okay. I think pretty soon\nthey're gonna get off the train in... \"Rorschark\"? Rorschach.\nRor-shark? Ror-shack.\nRor-shack. And transfer onto to this one\ntowards St Margrethen. If they do this  it looks like\nwe should beat them by a couple minutes. Haaugh. And we just gotta hope\nwe land first. It's gonna be tight. I hope they're stressing. They're probably looking\nat our flight tracker. (laughs) I really hope\nthey're stressing! Adam has decided\nhe can't sit down anymore because the stakes are too high. And also he just— He's only had caffeine today. Uggh. Oouggh. (yawning)\nIt's gonna be so tight  Ben. They're gonna be watching\nthe dot on the flight tracker. Yeah  and the thing is \nthis plane today is landing much sooner than the average\nfor this flight. Yeah. Yeah \nwe've got lucky with this. Ben  their\nestimated time of arrival has been moved up to 11:25. I don't love that. Ohh  it's gonna be tight.\nIt's gonna be tight. I think that they're gonna be\nthe first ones there by about 15 minutes.\nBut then... I think we'll be able to\nstart the challenge first. 'Cause they'll have to deplane  get through the airport \nget onto transit  get three miles away\nfrom the airport. And I think that that will take\nlonger than 15 minutes. Yeah  it's gonna be close. Oh my god. It's gonna be close. What are the odds\nthat it keeps being this close? Yeah. It's fine. I really want this one. Yeah  well \nI really want all of them. Yeah  that's true. Because if we get it \nthen the score is 4-2  and if they get it \nthen it's tied. It's tied  but they have\na better route to more countries. I do think that they\nmight be overestimating how easy it's gonna be to do the run.\nThat route is not easy. That route is not easy. In fairness  yeah. How close are they? They're through\neverything now. So they're about to\ntransfer again... there. But that thing where? No  no  no. Go ahead.\nGo ahead. Say the name. Royzh—Royzhashberg. Rorschacherburg. No  that still sounds wrong. Alright. They need to get\nacross the border before we touch down there. Okay. Welcome to Rorschach.\nWelcome to Rorschach. We got one more train  and then we can run\nright over into Austria. I think that\nthey are landing in... five minutes. It's gonna be close. That's all we can say.\nI can see their plane. Look  it's coming in to land.\nUgh. They're slowing down. Yep. Contact. Text 'em.\nText 'em. Text 'em. Text 'em. Let's goooo. You have the text prepared! Of course. With a lot of fire emojis  nice.\nSeconds matter  Tom. Okay. Now we've just gotta see\nwhether they can steal it back. Yep  Austria claimed. Damn it. Ugh. I wanted that one.\nYeah  they got us. That's tough. That's tough to lose it by\n10  15 minutes. They got it for now.\nYep. I hope they enjoy it\nwhile it lasts. But we're coming for you. We're gonna steal your Austria.\n(zombie-moans) I think. Asterisk. Put an asterisk. You're revving up?\nYeah. There you go. Maybe we can fuel up with some weed-flavored\niced tea. Oh yeah.\nThey've still got it. That's what we're about to do. We're about to go Thurbo mode. We're going Thurbo mode. We're about to go\nabsolutely Thurbo mode. Austria  here we come. Okay. Oh  no. No  it's fine. They're still taxiing.\nThey're still taxiing. I think they're still taxiing.\nI was about to say  what the (bleep) Oh no.\nWhat? What? Oh  that's a bus. We're turning to the bus gate.\nThat's a bus. That's a bus. That's a bus. That's bad.\nWe got a bus gate. (laughs) (grumbles) It's bad luck.\nThat's bad luck. I feel like\nI'm gonna throw up. Yeah. You have the challenge\nready to go  right? I'm ready to go. That's Austria. That's Austria. It sure looks like it. Alright.\nAlright. Welcome to St Margrethen. We're still in Switzerland. We just gotta get over\nthe bridge into Austria and then we can start the steal. This time we're\nnot gonna stop the steal. No  we are starting it.\nThis time  we have to start the steal. We gotta keep counting. Alright. Okay. Come on  let's go. Alright  that was\na fairly efficient bus. It was...\nbut we still gotta try We've got other people\nclearly going for challenges.\nto get on the next train  yeah. (cackles) Even if the challenge is just\nmake a connecting flight. Come on. Need to find the train station. Yes. And look for\nthe fastest train to... Yes.\nWien Hauptbahnhof. There's fewer people\non this carriage down here. Okay  okay  so... We have all of these.\nWe could stop at Prater. Which is  that's tourist central. Okay  yeah. Wien Mitte is\nVienna City Centre Station. There are... There is literally\na shopping mall around it. I can't think of anywhere better\nto do this challenge  Sam. Have they made it\nacross the border? Alright  they've made it\nacross the border. As we thought in St Margrethen \nso they probably just started it. Oh  they've literally\njust crossed the border? We gotta get over the river. Okay.\nAlright  we're in Austria. Okay. We are starting the steal. Here is the challenge. Play classical music on\nnon-classical instruments. Play classical music\non non-classical instruments. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony\ndebuted in Austria in 1824. In this challenge  you must play\nthe famous \"Ode to Joy\" theme  but you may not use\nany musical instruments. The challenge is complete\nonce you play the selected portion of the piece correctly:\nall correct pitches  on beat  at least 140 beats per minute. You may rehearse\nas many times as you'd like. You may only make\none official attempt at your performance. Okay.\nOkay. We can do this. Okay  I'm gonna start looking up\nwhere we can go get bottles. Because bottles are gonna\nbe the way to do this. You start looking up\n\"Ode to Joy\". Yep. And figuring out\nhow many notes are in it. Supermarket \nan eight minute walk this way. What about this?\nThere's a... something here. Okay  we can look at that. How many notes? Five. Only five?\nYeah. Five bottles. Do you think\nthey need to be glass? Glass is gonna be best\nif they have glass  but plastic will work. Here  let's just get water here. Well  these are glass.\nWhere? These  great.\nThese will be great. Get seven of 'em\njust for good measure. 4  5  6  7.\nOkay. Do we need a little thing to... ...ting them with? Yeah  let's get\na thing to ting them with. We'll use this. I think we might\nwanna blow though. Oh  maybe.\nWell  it's  you know. We'll see  we'll see. Thank you.\nThank you. Alright.\nWe can just do it right here. So here's the deal. We just have to prove that each one can\nmake the right note... And then we have to play it.\nYeah. We're using a tuner. (unpitched whistling) So you know  so you're gonna need to pour\nout a little bit to get it. (B♭ whistling) That's a sound.\nThat's what you want. But I think tinging is\ngonna be better. I'm just worried about\nus getting it in tempo if we have to blow. That's true  that's\ngonna be a lot harder. What are the notes\nwe have to get? G  A  B  C  D. And then another D\nan octave lower. Okay  let's divide and conquer. You try to get notes G  A  and B. I'll try to get\nC  D  and the other D. (repeated tinging) Are we pulling?\nThree miles? We're at three miles.\nPull the challenge. Okay. Don't be a time limit.\nDon't be a time limit. Play classical music on\nnon-classical instruments. We need bottles. This is a time consuming one  which I think is good for us.\nYeah  yeah  yeah. And we get to choose\nwhen we do it. That's gonna be...\nYeah. Mind games  if they're\ndoing at the same— All correct pitches  on beat. Oh  how much...? (gasps) Oh  that's... that's so much\nmore than I thought. There's 16 bars there. (hums melody) 16 bars  perfect. It's not nothing. I... Sam? Mhm? There is an argument\nfor letting them fail this one. They are going to be panicking. (repeated metallic clanking) (multiple bottles clinking) Do we even need an F? What notes do we need? Are you having any luck? What? Are you having any luck? Not really. I can't really get it\nto work that well. I see the argument. 'Cause I guess the risk is that if we attempt this first\nand fail it first... They have all\nthe time in the world. Whereas... if we\nlet them attempt it first and they fail...\nMhm. It's ours for sure.\nYeah. I think we should proceed as if we're doing this for now.\nYeah. But I could see\na real discussion about whether we do\na real attempt. Yeah.\nDepending on how... How easy or\nhow difficult it is. (bottles tinging) That's an F♯. (bottle tinging) I was like  how much do\nI have to drink from F♯ to make it be a different note? Here  I'm gonna go over there. I'm having a lot of\ntrouble over here. It's really consistent\nif I blow into it  but it's less consistent\nif I plink it. I mean  blowing\nwill get different notes. (faint whistle) But I just don't know that\nyou can do it consistently. (near-B♭ whistle) You're pretty good at it. (alternating near-B♭ whistle\nin two octaves) Let's see if we can\nget it working this way. Yeah  okay. And see if I could\ndo the whole thing. (sustained whistle) That's a G.\nThat's a G. (whistle) That's an A.\nThat's an A. ♪ (A–G) ♪ That's pretty—\nI think you were— you're doing that pretty fast. Okay  we'd have\nto do a lot of practice  but I could probably get it. (A♭ whistling) (F whistle) Let's see what this is. (whistle)\nThat's a D. That's a D. We need a D. So I'm gonna do in-between notes.\nI'm gonna do 'em in alphabetical order. A  D. This is going pretty fast. Yeah  but I'm just really\nworried about playing it. But it's fine. Okay  here we go. Ready? Can you check where they are? Yes. Our train's stuck in a tunnel. We are nowhere near\nWien Mitte yet. Nope.\nThis is not good. (whistle) C.\nThat's a C. We need a C. Okay  so now we need a B \nwhich will be in between these two. (whistle) That's a B.\nThat's a B. A  B  C  D. G.\nG. Then we need a B that\nis an octave lower. Is what Amy wants. So that's gonna be\nalmost no liquid. (low whistle) It's a G.\nIt's a G. This is with no liquid. It might just be that\nit can't go lower. (low whistle) Still a G. We need\na bigger bottle  I think. Okay  you... I'm gonna start practicing. I'll see if I can\nfind us another bottle. Here's what I think\nis happening. I think they've already\nfound instruments. I think they're\nnot panicking at all. I think they are already rehearsing. I can't read (bleep)-ing music. I don't know what this starts on.\nHow many notes are in this? One  two  the highest note.\nWhat's the highest note we have? The D?\n♪ (D whistle) ♪ ♪ (slow whistling\n\"Ode to Joy\" melody) Right?\nYeah  that's pretty good. Look  man.\nRight? Your only job right now is to find anything\nthat can make a lower D. There's something\nelse I can buy. I guess what it really\nall comes down to  Tom... is how hard do they\nthink this challenge is? In some ways we're in\na bit of a standoff. Yeah.\n'Cause it's like... Some— One of us has to\ntake the initiative and go  this is the performance. And that's the\npass or fail moment. Oh no  absolutely. But I keep going back\nand forth  'cause... on the one hand \nthey have the time advantage. So maybe we just wanna... If we can—\nWe wanna pressure them. Well  we\nwanna pressure them. But on the other hand \nwe want to give it a shot. Same thing.\nOn locking this. I think twangy rulers\nis our best shot. Okay. We can tune them \nwe can lock them down  and then it's just a case\nof playing 'em like a piano. Rulers  rulers  rulers \nrulers  rulers  rulers  rulers  rulers  rulers.\nThere's a plastic ruler. That  no  that's exactly it.\nThis is your twangy one. (ruler buzzing) Come on. Cheap plastic ruler. (ruler buzzing) Try changing the...\nB. Yeah. No. Yeah.\nThat was a good shout. I'm annoyed by that.\nOkay  well  let's see. Then it's six bottles  but we need to make sure we can—\nthey're glass bottles. We'll worry about\nplaying on the bottles. About what? Just the actual\nplaying of things. Yeah  no \nthat's really difficult. ♪ (\"Ode to Joy\" whistling) ♪ (mimes whistle) I've got it.\nYou just need the stupid D! Ouuaagh! Okay  I just need to find... This is a kebab place. They do have bottles \nbut they're all the same size. We need like a big  big bottle. What is this? Oh wait.\nIt might be a grocery store. I think this is a grocery store. Oh  where... is the entrance? (breathy A whistle) Not reliably  not at speed. (sighs) Agh! I can only hope\nthat Adam and Ben are having the same problems. (sighs) Ben's coming\nback with nothing. No? There's a grocery store\nover there. They don't take Visa or\nAmerican Express  but they have\nbig bottles of wine. Okay  okay. Do you have cash?\nI have euros  yeah. We're in the Eurozone.\nI'll run  okay? Yeah  it's pretty obvious...\nCheck on them. (bleep) They're right by the station. They could complete\nthis challenge ...at any moment. Jesus Christ. So what else? We could make\nwooden spoon maracas. That's not pitched. Paper straw pan pipes. Hello. (winces) That means having to\n(blows) very precisely over\nthe right... thing  but... Elastic band guitar. I think of those  pan pipes\nmight be our best option. But it's just nailing the\n(blows) Might be worth getting\nthem to see at least. Do you want me to see if\nI can get them from that shop so you can stay with these?\nYeah. In case we want\nto try more with these. Yeah. I don't think we're getting\nour octave outta these. No. Come on Adam \nwhere are you? (chuckles despairingly) Folks...\nHe has the bottle of wine. Got it?\nYeah. Okay. We should\nbe able to make this work. Okay  get the tuner out. (whistle) C4.\nC4. (whistle) A3. (low whistle) What's the (bleep)-ing order? If I can go below a G3 \nwhat is that? (low whistle) E3.\nWe're almost there. (deep whistle) D3.\nD3. Okay.\nOkay. Do you wanna practice? So I'm gonna\npractice a little bit. Practice a little bit. ♪ (whistling \"Ode to Joy\") ♪ Okay  can you\ncheck what the tempo needs to be though?\nWhat's 140 BPM? In seconds?\nWell  just beat it out for me. I just wanna make sure\nI'm going fast enough  or if I could slow down \nthat'd be nice. (metronome ticking) That's 140? (whistling)\n(metronome flickers off and on) Really?\nBut again— That's so (bleep)-ing fast. Sam  I've been\nstanding here for... a good five  six minutes now  just doing that with many\ndifferent tone generators. Mhm.\n(glass tinging) And I'm sure...\nwith a laptop and a microphone  I can analyse this and\nprove the pitches  but I... Yeah  I mean  it\ndoesn't help that we have... No.\na street going by. I could not find paper straws. Okay. I mean  a couple of thoughts... would be like one \nI think if we got... a taller  narrower glass.\nYes. I think the pitch effect\nwould be more pronounced based on water. Champagne flutes \ntall glasses  test tubes  anything like that.\nYeah. Let's try that. Okay  well shall we\nget rid of these and then... Ugh  yes. ♪ (whistling with metronome) ♪ This is the hard part \nis getting this. 'Cause that's only\none (bleep)-ing note. ♪ (whistling in stereo) ♪ Raagh! Wouldn't we want\nthis to be near this? Yeah  maybe that is better. (metronome continues) (slow testing whistling) I hate how long\nwe're spending on this. I know we're not technically under\nany big time pressure right now  but I wanna be travelling.\nI wanna get to new countries. Just to gut check  we definitely want to\ncontinue trying  right? (stammers breathily) Yeah. Well  we wanna\nat least put the pre— How much have they rehearsed?\nI don't know. Okay  I need\nto do it successfully twice in a row. And then we'll be ready  okay. (whistling with metronome) (in montage)\nDa da-da da da Da da-da-da\nda da. (whistling overlapping) (metronome continues) How you feeling? Insane. Yeah.\nI feel insane. Have you tried locking in? I'm still looking\nfor twangy things. Well  there's twine \nbut that's not... That's not twangy enough. I mean  if you're\nconfident about... I'm really like...\nThere are rulers. Right. Oh  and this one's aluminium. So do you wanna just\nbuy one  twang it  see if we can get\na pitch out of it... If so  come back and\nget the rest? Okay.\nOkay. Right  here we go. Give it a good twang. Yeah. If this twangs and if we can get an octave\nout of short and long  this is the easiest\npossible solution. This is... It's aluminium. It should twang.\nYeah. Lemme find\nsomewhere to twang it. Where are you from? New York.\nAmerica. New York City?\nYeah. Oh yeah.\nEast Side. East Side. East Side.\nYeah. I like East and West. Yeah.\nWest Coast  Tupac. Can I do a photo?\nYeah  real quick. I gotta focus on this. (whistling to metronome) Peace  brother.\nSay  East Side. East Side. How are you feeling? (metronome stops) I'm so scared. If I do it one more time perfectly \nwe're going for it. Okay. (whistling with metronome) (ruler twanging) Maybe? (ruler buzzing semi-tonally) Come on.\nYeah? I mean  certainly getting a note.\nYeah. Question is  can we...\nCan we get an accurate note? (ruler buzzing testily) (sighs angrily) (deep D buzz)\nOh. That is a D.\nYeah. (whistling over metronome) I think we gotta go for it.\nAlright. (metronome continues) Okay  this is the one.\nYou got this. Okay  here we go. Three  two  one  go. ♫ (whistling \"Ode to Joy\") Yes! Ohhh!\nLet's call them  let's call them.

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome back\nto episode three of our six-day race to claim\nthe most European countries. Right now we're in\nthe middle of day two  and Ben and Adam have just\nmanaged to flip the lead. Tom and I started\ntoday well ahead with France  Belgium \nand the Netherlands  while Ben and Adam had\nonly managed to lock down Switzerland and Germany\non day one. But early this morning  they stole France\nout from under us by completing a challenge\nin Saint-Louis and then raced us to Austria. We managed to get there first \nclaiming the country and briefly tying the score. But Ben and Adam arrived\nonly minutes later  and after a\nnerve-wracking challenge  stole the country before\nwe had time to lock it. Yes! Ohh!\nLet's call them. Let's call them. That means\nthe score is now 4-2  and we're about to get the call\nwith the bad news. Nnngh. Oh  I'm getting a call.\nOh no. This is gonna be it.\nOh no. Okay  right. (sighs) Well  it could go\none of two ways. It could go one of\ntwo ways. Here we go. Gentlemen... They're happy. They look happy. Gentlemen  we played\na wonderful song. A beautiful song. And we've done it\nperfectly flawlessly. And we've stolen\nthe country of Austria. Austria is now ours.\nAlright. You had it for\njust a second there. What'd you play? We gave it to you\nfor a little hour. Alright  yeah \nno  fair play. We were looking\nfor twangy rulers  and we did not find them. It's 4-2  and... Rulers.\nRulers! We got a train to catch. Okay  good bye. Get on your train. Good luck. Alright.\n(smooches) (growls triumphantly) Let's (bleep)-in' goooo. And Adam  would it make you\nfeel any better to know... that the great country\nof Austria  which we now own... does export\n38.6 million kilograms of wheat per annum? I feel amazing\nknowing that. Ugh. Let's go.\nWhere are we going next? I don't know. Train? Oh  don't you dare\nget sad about that! You were all  \"I'm not\ngonna let them depress us.\" You were all— I'm not gonna let\nthem know that we did. Okay  now... We are off.\nI am so (bleep)-in' hyped up! To St Margrethen \nright across the thing  back into Switzerland \nand then we're gonna go down... Yeah  grab Liechtenstein. And we're gonna\ngo cross another bridge into Liechtenstein. Another country  not bad. We should potentially...\ngo do the Switzerland challenge. I think the smart move is to\ntry to lock Switzerland now  so that we know if we even need\nto try to lock Liechtenstein. Okay. First things first. Let's get rid of\nall of this wine. Alright. Back to Switzerland \nshall we? We stole two countries\nfrom them today. Good bye  Höchst. Alright.\nAlright. We have great timing\nfor a train to... ...Hungary.\nOkay  let's go. Let's— Let's get back\nto that station. Yep  this way. That's two countries\nstolen from us. Yeah  again... And we've—\nAnd one challenge failed. It's not awesome.\nHave they failed— They haven't failed\na challenge yet. No  I mean  they're\nalways good at challenges. Yeah. Alright  lead the way \nlead the way  lead the way. Quick update  Sam.\nYes. The lads have moved\nback to Switzerland. Okay.\nThey've crossed the border. Surely they'll \nat this point  lock Switzerland  right?\nI mean maybe they'll— You would assume\nyou'd lock Switzerland. I guess you'd wanna\ngo to Liechtenstein. You'd go to\nLiechtenstein  yeah. And then you'd\nlock Switzerland once you're back in Zurich  because then you'll\nhave better stuff there. Sam  we are in trouble. No  we're not.\nWhy are we in trouble? J chillin  Tom. Well  we're\nback in Switzerland. That to me... was some of the best\n(bleep) we've ever done. Here's what I think.\nI think we should go ahead and just try to lock\nSwitzerland now. Because I think if we\nlock Switzerland... there's no point in\nlocking Liechtenstein. Because if we lock Switzerland  and we have locked Austria now  then you could go steal\nLiechtenstein from us. But it would be\na huge waste of time. Yeah. Because it's\nnot easy to get to. We... should at least... finally... Yeah  finally  geez. see what our\nSwitzerland challenge is. Over a day later. Here we go. Déjà vu. Déjà vu. Shot for shot \nand word for word  recreate any\nat least 90 second scene from any previous\nseason of Jet Lag  in the place where\nit was filmed. The scene must include\nat least one person and at least\n30 seconds of dialogue. You may rehearse your scene\nas much as you want  but you must film it in\none  word-perfect take. Here's what I will say. I definitely think\nwe can do that  but we can't do it here. We can do it in Zurich. That's so annoying. But... Here's what I think\nwe should do. Let's go through Liechtenstein \nclaim it  and then let's go\nwhere we can do this. Because  well  just as\na rules clarification  you can't have two challenges\nactive at the same time. Which means that\nwe can't even see the Liechtenstein challenge.\nNo. But we can pretty\nmuch guarantee... We can 100% do this.\nthat we can do this. 'Cause we can do this\nat Zurich Hauptbahnhof. We can do this at\nZurich Airport. Let's go and let's\nhead towards Liechtenstein. We're gonna claim it  then we're gonna\nlock Switzerland  and then we're gonna\nfigure out what we do next. It's the RegioJet\nto Budapest. RegioJet  nice. Have you been\nto Vienna before? Yes  a long time ago. Some point I should actually go\nand stop at the Prater and... But  we must move on.\nMan. Tickets. When we get to Hungary \nwe've got maybe three hours left in the game day  right? Yeah  about that.\nOkay. What train do we\nwant to get outta there and where do we want to go?\n'Cause we can come back. But that doesn't\nseem to make sense when we could... No  we want to\ngo to Bratislava next. We could hopefully\nget Bratislava  and Bratislava has\nway better connections. How long 'til we hit the border? I don't know. Adam  did you know that\nWaagen von Coop und Migros stellen dir eine Zusatzfrage? I actually did know that.\nOkay  that's good. I just wanted to double check. We are almost to Buchs. Then... Liechtenstein will be ours. Sam  I'm having\na bit of a panic 'cause I just checked the route out of\nthe place we're going... Mhm.\nTo Bratislava. And there's only one train there and it gets us back after\nthe rest period starts? Well  there's a lot of trains\nback towards Vienna. Yeah  but there's— There are no connections\nout to Bratislava. Sam  this is not good. This is— There's no\nconnections out of there. Well  I mean—\nHow did we not check this? The thing that we...\ncould do is... just  there's super\nfrequent connections back to Vienna. And then from Vienna  there's pretty frequent\ntrains to Bratislava. So... Yeah  but we're still not\ngonna get there tonight. No  not necessarily  no. We can't get to\nBratislava tonight. There just isn't—\nThere just— There just isn't a train. We could walk. Speaking of which \nwhat are the lads doing? Let's focus up\non Liechtenstein. Welcome to Buchs. Welcome to Buchs.\nWe're still in Switzerland. But we're very close to the wonderful country\nof Liechtenstein. Indeed. Let's get over\nthis border  shall we? Let's cross\nyet another border. What time is\nour train outta here? We might have to hurry\na little bit actually. 2:40. Oh. We might not make our train. Uhh... Let's get this bus.\nOkay. This bus?\nMaybe. No. Schaan  Schaan. This bus.\nThat bus is to Schaan. We're on the bus\nto Liechtenstein. We thought we were gonna\nwalk over the border  but it turned out it was gonna take\nlonger than we thought. I'm excited to go\nto Liechtenstein. It's like... I don't know if it's\ncoming across on camera  but it's kind of\ncrazy beautiful here. It's true. Ooh. Man. Yeah. I mean  look at that. Ben  once we cross this river... Ben  welcome to Liechtenstein. Yaaay. That puts\nthe score at 5-2. Fun fact about\nLiechtenstein... is that it does not seem\nto export any wheat. This is our stop. Okay  well  we are\nhere in Liechtenstein. Welcome to\nLiechtenstein  buddy. It's great. Liechtenstein claimed. 5-2. I think the thing\nat this point  Tom  is going to be... how do we set ourselves up\nfor the earliest arrival into Bratislava\ntomorrow morning? Yeah  and the answer\nis probably back to Vienna. So I saw a train there.\nWhich one do we have to be on? So we can take a 4:32  which leaves us plenty of time.\nAnd that— Well yes. And that means we're back\nin Vienna Central at 5:20. It's not worth getting on\nanother one from there. And there's a 7:45\nfrom Vienna Central to Bratislava tomorrow.\nAlright. It's the best plan we've got. I think so.\nI'll keep researching  but... Oh  Ben is showing\nas far  far  far south and moving south  to me. Oh  well Adam is...\nshowing live. Ben is—\nBen is showing live. Oh.\nOh  no  Ben— Yeah  Ben's phone is\nstill moving south. I'm worried he\nmight have dropped it. Ben is— Ben's\nphone is moved— Oh! Oh no. Uhm.\nWell  quick update. Ben left his phone on the train. I lost my phone. But I'm gonna get another phone\nand then we'll be fine. This is... This is... It was... will not be a setback. What do you think\nabout Liechtenstein  Ben? I think it's very\nshockingly picturesque. I think it's cool\nhow little wheat they export. That's something I know. I think it is very cool\nthat they're... run by a corrupt prince who— here's something fun. The Prince of Liechtenstein \nhe spends all of his money on UFO research. I think that's pretty cool.\nYeah. And I think that's that\non Liechtenstein. There's a bus\nin three minutes. Great. So we cannot attempt\nthe challenge here because our Switzerland\nchallenge is still active. And we do very much\nwant to complete that. Yeah  that one\nwe need to lock. Score's 5-2 right now. You gotta feel\npretty good about that. You gotta feel\npretty good about that one. We're gonna take the bus\nback from Liechtenstein  and we can get\na train to Zurich. And in Zurich  we can go ahead \nand lock up... You lock up Switzerland \nand then it's a big question what we do next. We'll talk about it later. There's a lot of options. It's kind of confusing.\nYeah. Alright  well \ngood bye  Liechtenstein. You are vulnerable. You are so very vulnerable. But I do not think\nthat Sam and Tom will steal you from us. How are you feeling  Tom? Oh  I get what\nyou're going for. Hungary. Why? We've just\ncrossed the border. Claimed. Wasn't 'cause\nyou didn't have lunch? Claimed  claimed \nclaimed  claimed  claimed. Let me text 'em. Hungary... claimed. Should I mention the score? I can give you\na snack if you want. 5-3. Alright  Ben \nwe've got three minutes to get on our train. We-ow. I think I see platform one. Platform one. Alright  well... We're going\nto make our train. But...\n(sighs) They have claimed Hungary. They did Hungary first \nwhich is sort of interesting. They got there fast \nand Hungary is sort of... It's the hardest one.\nQuite difficult to get to. So that would imply to me\nthat they've done a good job of optimizing their route. But who knows?\nMaybe they'll get stuck. You can get stuck\nin Hungary. Alright.\nWe made it. Your tickets. Oh shoot  I—\nNow I don't have my... He left his phone\non the last train. His phone is lost. Thank you.\nBye. Thank you. Oh man.\nWe got a little bit of rain. This is a random ass rain.\nAnd... ...very little else. We have two hours in the middle of\nnowhere in Hungary to try and do a challenge. And that's... That's the best we're gonna get. Bye  RegioJet. Always  always a little  little \njust a tiny bit intimidating to get off at a\nmiddle of nowhere station. Oh yeah.\nIn a foreign country. (laughs)\nAnd see the train... Yep.\n...go away. But I'm sure we'll be fine. There's a little cover over there.\nMaybe we wanna go under. Yeah  alright. Okay. Send it. We gotta hope this\ndoesn't require a big city. Do 96 things.\n(chuckles) Do 96 things. The number 96 pops up\na lot in Hungary: The principality of Hungary\nwas established in 896  buildings in Budapest can't\nbe taller than 96 feet  and it takes 96 seconds to sing\nthe national anthem at tempo. Your team must\ncollectively do X burpees  drink Y half-ounces of wine  and complete Z multiplication\nproblems by hand  such that X plus Y plus Z\nequals 96. You must do your 96 things\nin 15 minutes. Teammates cannot do the same things\nat the same time. Here's the thing \nI can do a lot of burpees. Do either of us\nwant to drink wine? We get one\nfor each half-ounce. I think we should\nat least get a wine bottle in case things are going poorly.\nYeah  alright. (laughs) So I don't drink. Yeah.\nSo... (laughs)\nAnd I can't do the pushups  but I can do multiplication\nproblems  Sam. That's something I'm good at. Well  I suck at multiplication. Excellent  teamwork.\nLet's go get some wine. Well... Ben... I think your phone\nmight be donezo. Yeah  I think so. Okay. Welcome to Sargans. Now we just transfer\non the train to Zurich. Get yourself the lowest ABV\nthat looks like it tastes good. We need a nice\nHungarian wine. I found a lovely Merlot. I have found\nsome sort of local baked item and I'm gonna have that. I realised they had convenience store\nreheated food there  but this appears to be some\nlocal Hungarian bread product that our editors will look up\nand put the name on later. And it's still warm!\nIt's just come out the oven. We got wine. Thanks for the yoghurt as well.\nLet's go do this. Okay  rules are: You may not practice\nburpees or math. Your burpees must\ninclude a pushup. Your chest must\ntouch the ground. Right  15 minute—\nNeed me to set a timer? 15 minute time. Wait  it needs to be\nmultiplication specifically. Oh god  this is by hand? These are way harder than I thought they\nwere going to be. You ready?\nI can get a lot of burpees. Okay. You count in your head.\nI'll count in mine. 15 minutes starts ...now! 100. 1-9-0-0... 1-9-0-0... 1-9-1-8... Guh! We have to start\nplanning our next move. We have to decide what\nwe are going to do tomorrow. As I currently see it \nwe have... four different options. Tonight we start\ntraveling towards Milan. Then in the morning \nwe finish our journey to Milan. We claim Italy... and then we fly out\nof Milan Airport. Option two:\nWe do all that stuff. But instead of flying\nout of Milan Airport  we continue from Milan to Rome \nwhere Vatican City is. Claim the Vatican.\nClaim the Vatican. We end the day at Rome. Fly outta Rome.\nFly outta Rome in the morning. Other option: We fly out of Zurich\ndirectly to Rome  which we can do. And then there are\ntwo more flights that we were looking at. We were looking\nat an early flight to Amsterdam.\nYeah. And a slightly later\nflight to Copenhagen. So the flight to Amsterdam... is great 'cause\nit's really early. It's super expensive. That would be like $1 000\ntotal  which I hate. That's tough \nand the thing is... I know that we haven't been\nspending that much money now  but in the later days\nof the game  we're gonna need—\nThe flights— Yeah  we're gonna\nhave to fly a lot. I don't know. 8-6-2-4-9-4. I'm not certain about that.\nIt's a minus. No. Do it again. Do it again.\nDo it again. Do it again. Five. Wait  it said by hand! It didn't say in your head.\nIt said by hand! Sam  I'm using your notes app. Are we all done?\nI don't know. 10 minutes remaining.\nHow are you doing? I'm outpacing math  so... Okay  cool. How are you on numbers?\nI'm only on 11. I'm on 39  so...\nOkay  gimme a sec. You sure?\nYeah  it's fine. I suck at math and\nI'm good at burpees. Okay  well... (grunts loudly) You gotta squat. Oh  I've gotta\nsquat as well? Yeah.\nOh  I physically— Never mind  we'll carry on.\nI forgot how to squat. There we go! 75.\nWhat are you on? 75.\n75. So our total is 90  91? 76. I wanna do the wine as\nlike the last couple. Yeah  that's fair. In the next three minutes\nand 59 seconds. Let's go get that train. How much is\nthat many ounces? Honestly  that was... One  one more gulp for... Easily.\nSam  challenge completed. Let's give 'em a call.\nLet's give 'em a call. Let's give 'em a call. Oh  and they're calling us. I wonder if they've\nlocked Hungary  or if they've\nabsolutely biffed it. We've locked Hungary!\nThey look happy. Hungary is locked! (sputters)\n(cackles) Wait  what did you do? 96 burpees\n96 things. slash multiplication tables\nOh  you did that one. Oh my god.\nslash half wine ounces. Sam hard carried that.\nWas it close? I managed like 15\nmultiplication problems. He did 80 burpees\nin 12 minutes. Wow. I don't understand\nthis challenge  but it sounds... 96 is apparently an\nimportant number in here. Okay. And so you had to... Was it close? Was it tight? We're going.\nWe're catching a train. Bye. Crisp! Haah!\nI'm— That's a good thing to\nend our strategy day on  right? I was feeling bad about this.\nYeah. That's a high—\nLet's go get that train. Hungary  you have been lovely. It's been a very brief visit  but  whatever pastry this is \nit's really nice. The wine was good  honestly.\nAnd you are— And you get delightful music\nfor your train announcements. Well  they locked Hungary.\nI don't really care. But good for them. I guess. That means that... they'll have gotten\none country today. No  they lost two. Oh  France. Yeah.\nRight. Their net for the day is zero.\n Their net for the day is zero. Wait  their net\nfor the day is... They have three. They started\nyesterday with three  and now they have three.\nNow they have three. Sure.\nIt's hard to believe. But they have made\nno progress today. I forgot that we\nstole France this morning. Yep. Yes  we did. Sam  I am in a good mood.\nThat's good. I realise we're still behind... but... We locked the country\nlike we wanted to. We haven't got as far\nas we wanted  you know  and we knew\nwe were gonna get between two and four countries.\nYeah. We got two \nand then we lost one. It's not what we wanted. This one I think\nwas always gonna be the trickiest of the three. Yeah. And tomorrow... Tomorrow we should\nbe able to sail through Bratislava and Czech Republic\nand then get maybe an afternoon flight\nor something  Yeah.\nif we're lucky. Now an update\nfrom the lads. Their tracker puts them\non the route back to Zurich. Well  Ben's tracker or\nAdam's tracker? (snickers) Well  welcome\nback to Zurich. We still have not decided\nwhat our next move is  but regardless \nwe've gotta do this challenge and lock Switzerland. And we gotta do it right.\nWe gotta do it right. We really cannot mess this up. If we leave\nSwitzerland open  we're in big  big \nbig  big trouble. Huge trouble.\nBecause... Especially 'cause\nLiechtenstein is not locked. We did film... at Zurich Station.\nWe did. In season nine\nof Jet Lag: The Game. Yep.\nA very  very wordy scene. I wish that we\nhadn't said so many words. One other thing we could do is we could split\nthe remaining territory down the middle\nby asking if he's near the same international airport. 'Cause there's one in Zurich  and there's one in\nSt Gallen  here. And we could find out\nif he's here or here  but... (croaks) So we should see\nif there is a less wordy... Yeah.\n...option. Or if maybe we want\nto go somewhere else. Let's take a look\nat the footage. Yeah. And see which scene\nwe wanna recreate. Let's just try\nto get somewhere warm. Yeah  it's cold. Okay  Tom. I've looked into\nour options tomorrow. Mhm? There are pluses and\nminuses to both directions. Okay. But I think it actually\nmight make more sense to head to... the Czech Republic first.\nOkay. We can take\nan 8:20— 8:10 am to Breclav  which is\nthe border station. Yep.\nFrom there... we can spare... it's not bad  it's an hour 15.\nMhm. Can get an hour 15\nfor challenges. Okay.\nBut we have to take the 10:20 to Bratislava. Right. It'll get us into Bratislava\nat 11:26 am. And I— And we can\nget 55 minutes  if... we don't take the train\nto the airport  but there seems to be\na direct bus  and we get to the airport\nat 1:10. Which gives us flight options to both Copenhagen...\nYeah. And to... And to Rome without\ncutting it too close. So I think in our minds  we need to make a flight at the end of the day.\nAlright. But we're actually arriving\nin two minutes. We are arriving into Vienna. Made up a lot of time.\nWe did. So actually \nI need to pack my bag. Alright. Yeah  I think... we need to make a flight\nat the end of the day. Yep. And that's more important\nthan locking countries  I think. Particularly if\nthere's only one country left unlocked there.\nYeah. One country\nis not tempting. Okay  okay  so... A little update. It does seem like\nthe Zug[zuhg] segment is gonna actually be\na lot easier to memorize. It has the fewest words.\nYeah. Okay.\nThe road pattern of... Merlischachen kind of fits. But... it's not close enough\nto feel like a slam dunk. And also if we go to Zug  and we're able to complete this\nby the end of tonight  we can get on\na train first thing... Towards Milan.\nTowards Milan. Go down to Rome \ndo the whole Rome train plan. Yeah  there's actually a\n7:30 am exactly train from Zug. I think that this is probably\nthe safest thing to do. Because the truth is I started getting\nextremely scared that we will fail\nthis challenge. I don't know if you saw\nwhen we tried to memorize the Ōkaihau Express... It did not go great. ♪ She... starts out from Otiria ♪\n♪ She... starts out from Otiria ♪ ♪ The smallest train you'll see ♪\n♪ The smallest train you've seen ♪ Nope. You've already got it wrong.\nWhat? ♪ Driving— ♪\n♪ This is— ♪ No  it's driving!\n(bleep) ♪ When they're dripping\nfrom the sack ♪*\\ No! (bleep) Ohh  this is a\n(bleep)-ing nightmare! Mm-kay  we're gonna\nstudy on the train. Off to Zug. All you Zug-heads out there\nare gonna go crazy over this. They're going south. They're going south? Yeah.\nHigh-speed to Italy? Maybe? Although I'm not sure that's\nthe right route for that. Why would they go\nall the way to Zurich and then south? (distant whistle)\nOh  Sam. (brakes squeal) ♫ (train plays C major scale) ♫ (sustained near-D note) So... That is the train to Kyiv. We could have\nused the train to Kyiv as an instrument. Joking aside  does put it all a bit\nin perspective  doesn't it? We're getting to do\nall this travel  all these countries... and that's heading\nto a country at war. Doesn't even have... Those are Ukrainian carriages. That's cool. Alright. What are they doing? Yeah  I think...\nthey're on the route that would take them to... Lugano and stuff  which is interesting.\nDoing the... It's not the route I'd take. Although the one\ninteresting thing  Tom  is... they still haven't\nclaimed Switzerland. They still haven't\nclaimed Switzerland. Oof. Okay. Welcome to a place\nthat I know very well. And I don't know at all. We're in Zug.[zuhg]\nWe're in Zug.|zuhg And we're going to\nperform a scene for you. We didn't really have any\nfootage on that train ride  because we were both— We were\nmemorizing our lines. We were in our—\nthe sort of memorization zone. Okay. We can do as many\nrunthroughs as we like. But then we got the one\nthat's gotta count. We get the one. This bench? Right? Yeah?\nYep  this is it. I've really gotta embrace my inner Sam.\nMm-kay. Would you like to do\na readthrough on book or off book? Let's just see what we've got. Okay. I think I've probably \nin the intervening minutes  lost some.\nOkay. Alright  are you ready?\nMhm. The road pattern of...\nMerlischachen kind of fits. But... it's not close enough to\nfeel like a slam dunk. Okay. The road pattern of\nMerlischachen kind of fits. But... it's not close enough to... to... No  see  this is\none of those ones. – to feel like a slam dunk. No... I think this does match.\nNo  I think this does match. Look  this thing.\nLook  this thing. That totally matches that. That matches that. I mean you can clearly... mm.\nI mean you can clearly... mm. It's pretty close. That is pretty close. Nope. \"It's pretty close.\" It's pretty close. – confirm it for us\nbefore we go there. And look \nhow about you do that? This just confirmed it for me. – that can confirm it for us\nbefore we go there. And look \nwhy don't you do that? \"How about you do that?\" Oh  god. Now that I think\nabout orientation  yeah  that is pretty clear. Now that I think\nabout orientation  yeah  that is pretty clever. Nope. \"That is pretty clear.\" No. That is pretty clear. I'd been memorizing\nthat as \"clever\". Okay  it seems like we have\nabout 10 minutes until the next train option there. Okay  well  seems— Mm-mm. Okay  seems like we have\nabout 10 minutes. Okay  seems like we have\nabout 10 minutes until the next\ntrain option there. Okay  I'm gonna—\nYou need to review all of this. Bleh. I don't think we're\ngonna do it tonight. We have 10 minutes. I mean  how badly do\nwe wanna take that train? Not that badly. Not that badly. We'll do it in the morning. We're going to have\nforgotten all it by the morning. Well  we'll re-memorize it \nor we could do it now. Do you think you—\nHere's what I'll tell you. I will get it right now. Yeah  what?\nGimme a percentage. 95%. 95%? That's pretty good. I'd say like 70% chance\nI get it all right. I'm giving you 70%. No.\nNo? You're much more confident than me.\nLet's try it. Let's try it. Let's try it. But as practice?\nAs practice. Okay. Okay. The road pattern of\nMerlischachen kind of fits. But... it doesn't feel like— Nope  already wrong. (cackles deeply) Alright  well. Ugh. We'll see you tomorrow morning. (smooches) So when you said\n70% chance you get it. (stammers)\nSeven— this is like— Have you heard of\nNate Silver before  Adam? Alright  well \nthat's game day end. (laughs) That coulda\ngone better. We're gonna\nhave to pick it up if we're gonna catch up.\nYeah. We're gonna have to hope\nfor some fumbles by them. I think they're setting up\nfor tomorrow that... I'm not sure they'll get three.\nI think they can get two. I'm not sure they can get two\nand get somewhere useful. Yeah. So that might be the thing\nthat helps us catch up a bit. Sam  they have\nsurprised us twice. Yeah. I have no doubt that\nthey'll surprise us again. But it doesn't matter tonight\nbecause we know we've got a plan\nfor the morning. We can decide which flight\nwe take tomorrow  and beyond that? First thing tomorrow? Czech Republic. Czech Republic. See you there.\nSee you tomorrow. Good morning.\nDay three. What's the plan  Sam? I think... head to\nthe Czech Republic. Yep. So we do Czechia  then Slovakia  hopefully do\na challenge in both. 'Cause we do not wanna\nleave two countries next to each other undefended. Yeah  but I think\nI'll feel good as long as we lock one.\nYeah  same. But what I\ndon't wanna do is miss a flight this evening. Yes  and we don't know\nwhat flight that's gonna be until we know where\nthe lads are going. Yeah  I mean... Speaking of which... So they ended— I was hoping they\nwere gonna cut there. Good morning.\nGood morning from Zug.[zuhg] Actually we learned... We learned that\nit's not pronounced anywhere close to 'zuhg'. We have gotta get this memorized and executed on. Yeah. So I think the key is here\nwe just take our time. Yep.\nWe nail it. We're in no rush. And then we figure out\nwhat the next step is. We have several good options. Yep. I think we should\ntake a look at our lines. Refresh our memories. Yeah. Trying to memorize\nall of this Sam dialogue has really messed me up. I had a dream last night\nthat I was Sam. That's not good. No  it was frightening. So they ended in Zug[zuhg]. Yep.\nWhich... is on the route towards Italy. But why are they\nnot locking Switzerland? Why did they not\nlock Liechtenstein? If they leave both\nof those undefended  that is painting a giant target.\nYeah. They give us two points\nand take two away from them. Lemme check our trains.\nAlright. Oh wow. There was a line... There was a word that\nI had kind of forgotten. Oh goodness  okay.\nIn my head. You see that's the\ndifficult thing is if you accidentally memorize it\nwrong  then it can get stuck. I've got mine. Do you wanna just\ntry running it? Okay. The road pattern of\nMerlischachen kind of fits. But... it's not close enough to feel like a slam dunk. Look... this thing. That totally matches that. Now that I think\nabout orientation  yeah... That is pretty clear. Okay. Seems like we have\nabout ten minutes until the next\ntrain option there. That was perfect. Oh  I just feel like\nwe've gotta get it perfect so many times. I think we\nshould get it perfect five times in a row.\nYeah. Okay  ready? Okay. Got it. Well  that explains why\nwe couldn't do this. Alright  thank you.\nThank you. Alright  yeah  this is—\nThat's not ideal. Well  the train\nthat we wanted to take from Breclav to Bratislava... it shows up on the schedules  but apparently it's\nnot actually running. To be clear  we were able\nto put that on our planner. Google Map says it's going.\nInterrail says it's going. And then we talked to\nthe clerk in the office. Which  this\nhas happened before. This is—\nYeah. Alright  so no.\nEmergency planning. Do we flip to the other trains? No  'cause we've\nmissed that direction. The thing that we might\njust need to do now is... Panic? I mean  there's a 10:55\nthat gets us in at 12:02. 10:55.\nThe downside of that is it'll only leave us\n18 minutes in Bratislava. So we would not really be\nable to do the challenge. We could probably make\nthe airport train at 12— or the airport bus at 12:20. It'd be a little tight\nin case of delays. Right.\nBut... I don't see that we\nhave another option  but... No  I don't think so. That means we've already\nnot locked one country. Yeah. I still think this\ndirection makes sense. Yes  it does. And that's right. It just... sucks! Well  I mean— Come on  let's go.\nLet's go  let's go  let's go. Okay  so... In—\nSam  take— we got— Oh yeah. Big window. Very nice.\nBig window. Yeah  so I'm looking\ninto the schedules of how to get from Bratislava\nto the airport. Yeah. And the tl;dr is that... if we don't make\nthat 12:20 bus... Mhm. ...we're toast. And we just have to... The thing that would screw us – as a moment of\npotential foreshadowing – Yeah. – is the train from\nBreclav to Bratislava getting delayed even a bit. Because we will have to\nmake an 18 minute connection Yeah. at Bratislava Central Station. Is the bus leaving from\nBratislava Central Station? Yes.\nOkay. Okay. Seems like— No. Seems like we have— Nope  no  you had it. \"Seems like we have –\" Seems like we have\nabout 10 minutes until the next train option there. It's like a perfectly\nnormal sentence  but there's something\nabout it for whatever reason. Yeah. Let's just run it again.\nLet's just keep running it. I mean  look \nI think we've got this. Yeah  but let's not even— But if we just like\n1 000% this. You know what I mean?\nYep. The road pattern of\nMerlischachen kind of fits  but it's not close enough\nto feel like a slam dunk. Great.\nHow are you feeling? We're— I feel good. If we wanted to do it... we could do it\nand make the 8 am train. Here's my opinion. I think the flight to Rome\nis better than the 8 am train. The 8 am train is free  but... the flight would get\nus in early enough that we could really\nconfidently knock out Italy and the Vatican.\nYeah. Without having\nto worry about time. Let's book the flight. Oh  by the way \nBen got his phone back. Oh  we have\na story to tell you. We were like  \"Tom and Sam \nBen lost his phone  but they— but you guys\nhave a tracker on it.\" So they were watching and\nseeing where it went and they were like \n\"Well  it seems like it stopped in this town called St. Gallen.\" And my friend Sarah from home  not from here...\nWho has appeared. Who has appeared in season four.\nIn Jet Lag: The Game. Yeah  actually has a—\nreal heads know. She was in Switzerland \nand Adam remembered that she had texted me\nearlier that day mentioning that she was\ngonna be in St. Gallen. And so Adam was like  \"You should call her and see\nif she's still in St Gallen.\" And she was  and she went\nto the train station  and they had my phone. And then was able\nto bring it to me  and then we all got fondue. It was awesome.\nIt's true. We got some really\nawesome fondue. Ben  we're booked. Fabulous. Let's keep running it.\nLet's just keep doing it. Okay. Ooh.\nOh look  big river. This might be the Danube. I'm pretty sure\nthat is the Danube. They're still in Zug[zuuhg]  so I wonder if they're\ndoing their challenge there. If they lock Switzerland  we lose a really big\nstrategic option there. 'Cause stealing Switzerland and Liechtenstein\nis  honestly... It's a path we really need to get back on the level.\nIt's attractive. But that's why I think\nthat they must— It must be worth it\nfor them to attempt it. Surely. So I think\nour only hope is that... They fail it.\nThey fail it. Yeah  actually  yeah. It's a perfect fit. Oh  (bleep)!\nIt's a perfect match. It's a perfect match. See  that's one of those ones. It's like match versus fit. Easy to mix 'em up.\nSorry. It's a perfect match.\nPerfect match. This is the train.\nThis is the platform. I mean  this isn't— there's\nan 8:32 on this platform. What's— When's the next train? 8:59. It gets in at 9:44 ...for a 10:50 flight. Yeah  it's close \nbut I think we'll be fine 'cause we have tickets. I don't know. At a certain point though \nwe do just have to do it. I know  I know. But the thing is as we get\ncloser to doing it  I get... Yeah. I think let's do it\none more time and then let's just go for it.\nOkay. Ready?\nYeah. Okay. The road pattern of\nMerlischachen kind of fits. But  it's not close enough to\nfeel like a total slam dunk. No  no  no. No.\nNo  not total. No. No.\nOkay. I got distracted. I got distracted. (both crack up) What's happening? Shh  don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Oh my god.\nOkay  just let me breathe. Let me breathe. Okay  I've got it. Take it from the top. Okay. I don't like the speed\nthis train is going  Sam. We have been\nstuck in a tunnel and going no faster than this\nfor quite a while now. We have... more than 90 minutes\nin Breclav  so... More than\n90 minutes right now. Yeah. We have margin for\nerror  I think. Do we have a margin\nfor more bad luck? Always. Seems like we have\nabout ten minutes until the next\ntrain option there. Do you want to go for it? Can we run it one more time?\nYep. Seems like we have\nabout ten minutes until the next\ntrain option there. Let's just run it. Let's do it.\nOkay. Okay. This is the one. Here we go. Okay.\nThe road pattern of... Merlischachen kind of fits. But... it's not close enough\nto feel like a slam dunk. Okay. The road pattern of\nMerlischachen kind of fits. But it's not close enough\nto feel like a slam dunk. Okay  but one second. Küssnacht am Rigi doesn't rhyme. \"Merli-shanen\" does. Okay  wait \nwait  wait  wait  wait. Wait... wait...! Okay  but one second. Küssnacht am Rigi doesn't rhyme. \"Merli-shanen\" does. Okay  wait  wait  wait \nwait  wait  wait  wait. I assume you're looking\nat this thing here.\nI assume you're looking\nat this thing here. Wait.\nWait. No. I think this does match.\nNo  I think this does match. Look  this thing.\nLook  this thing. That totally matches that.\nThat totally matches that. Look at the bottom part.\nLook at the bottom part. Look at these next to each other.\nLook at these next to each other. What is this place called?\nWhat is this place called? Melis  whatever.\nMelis  whatever. \"Merlis-chanen.\"\n\"Merlis-chanen.\" I mean  we would need some— To go all the way out there \nwe would need something ...much more conclusive. No  this is the—\nI think this is it. I really think this is it. Wait  wait  I'm gonna trace it. Mm-kay. I mean  we would need some— To go all the way out there \nwe would need something much more conclusive. No  this is the—\nI think this is it. I really think this is it. Wait  wait  I'm gonna trace it. Mm-kay. That's gotta be it.\nThat's gotta be it. Mmm.\nMmmmnnh... Come on.\nCome on! I mean  you can clearly... mm.\nI mean  you can clearly... mm. It's pretty close.\nIt's pretty close. That's it.\nThat's it! Okay  well  let's figure out whether or not there is\nsomething in that town that can confirm it for us\nbefore we go there. And look \nhow about you do that? This just confirmed it for me. Okay  well  let's figure out whether or not there is\nsomething in that town that can confirm it for us\nbefore we go there. And look \nhow about you do that? This just confirmed it for me. I guess I hadn't thought\nabout orientation yet. Orientation fits really well.\nLook at that. It's exact. Yeah  actually  yeah. It's a perfect match. Now that I think\nabout orientation  yeah  that is pretty clear. I guess I hadn't thought\nabout orientation yet. Orientation fits really well. Look at that. It's exact. Yeah  actually  yeah. It's a perfect match. Now that I think\nabout orientation  yeah. That is pretty clear. Okay  seems like we have\nabout ten minutes until the next train option there. Okay. Seems like we have\nabout ten minutes until the next\ntrain option there. I think that was it.\nThat was it. That was it. That was it.\nWe got it. (groans exhaustedly) There we go.\nHooh  we got it! Okay. We just finished watching\nback the footage  and we did—\nwe got every word. We got every word exactly right. You're shaking. I know  I know. Well  I'm cold too. Lots of reasons to be shaking. Hello.\nGentlemen  after a long... some might say\ntoo long amount of time... we have locked Switzerland. At long last. We had to recreate\na scene from Jet Lag  a 90-second scene \nword perfect. Which is why\nwe are here in... Zug[zoog]. And so I had to do\nall your lines  Sammy. You are a damn yapper. Sorry  Ben. Alright  bye.\nGood. Bye! So they gave us\nsome additional... non-critical info there. The reason they're in Zug is not because they're\ngoing to Italy. The reason they're in Zug\nis to recreate... Oh  in the original location\nfrom a previous season. They still could be\ngoing to Italy. But it just means that... we thought that\nthe reason they were in Zug  because it's on\nthe line to Italy. But  they were there to recreate our time in the Zug zone. We've done it. We took so long\nthat actually now... that flight to Rome\nthat we were like  it leaves so (bleep)-ing\nlate in the day. We have infinite time.\nThis blows. Actually... Now we're gonna\nbe cutting it close. We're cutting it close now. Let's go to the airport. We're off to the flughafen. ♪ Doo-do-do do-do-do ♪\nWoo! ♪ B'da-da-da-da da ♪ Okay  Adam \nI have a question. I'd love to answer\nyour question  Ben. Where are Tom and Sam? Uhm... losing. Let's look. They're somewhere...\nwhere they're losing this game. That's true.\nThey're in the losing zone. I have to keep\nreminding myself that I'm travelling\nthrough Europe on a panorama car\non a beautiful morning ...playing a game. Come on  I'm stressed. Jet Lag isn't a game  Tom. It's life. But that does mean that\nwe are currently losing at life 5-3  Sam.\nWell  yes  that's true. If you lose at Jet Lag \nyou're a loser. They are nearly...\nin the Czech Republic. Assumed to be...\nAre they going to Breclav? Yeah  basically\non the train to Breclav. I would assume. After that  they'll make\ntheir way down to Bratislava  I would assume. I think the real\nquestion is just... Yeah  can they\nget a flight out? Are they gonna leave \nyeah  to— Because if they can leave today \nthey could get three countries. Yeah  the real question is  will they be able to\nknock these things out fast enough that\nthey get a flight? My current opinion is... ...unlikely. So... This train is currently\nnine minutes late. It's fine.\nIt's okay. That gets us in at 9:13. Our train out is at 10:55. That's so much time. If it's something like\ntheir challenge in Switzerland... Yeah.\nThen... If it's a time waster challenge \nwe're in serious trouble. But if it's not a\ntime waster challenge  if it's on a time limit  then that's a\nchallenge we can fail. Yeah. Have we reached another country?\nThree  two  one. That's the border.\nThis is Czechia. Text 'em  claim the point. I don't know\nhow to spell Czechia. Yep. Claimed. I have something to say. I have to— I have a statement.\nI'm gonna issue a statement. If Sam and Tom fail to lock... the Czech Republic and Slovakia... they're in big  big \nbig trouble. We will take them\nfrom them. Yeah  'cause those are\npretty easy to do. Boop boop. So these challenges are\ngonna matter a lot for them. Good luck  Sam and Tom. I'm looking up how\nto pronounce this place. I think the main\nfeature of Jet Lag is us butchering\nsmall town names all around the world. Alright. Hey Tom?\nYeah? Czech this out. (scoffs)\nWe're in the Czech Republic. Hey  let me have my bit.\nOkay  so... That train\nwas 17 minutes late. We have one hour and 31 minutes\nbefore we gotta get on a train outta here to Bratislava.\nAges  Tom! When I'm watching Jet Lag \nI'm always looking at the teams in moments like this and going \n\"Why are you not running? Why are you not sprinting?\nWhy are you not—\" 'Cause we've got ages of time. No  it's because\nwe've got six days of this and there's only so\nmuch stress we can take. Ages of time! Alright. There's shops. There's an automated\nparking bike tower. You ready? Sure. One hour  28 minutes. Kill time  then tell time. Kill time  then tell time. Czechia is home to the oldest continuously working\nclock in the world: the one on the\nOld Town Hall in Prague. Your task now is to do three of five time-killers\nof your choice from the list below \nthen guess what time it is. You may not look at any clocks  and you may not look\nat the elapsed time on your filming phone. To complete the challenge \nyour guess must be within five minutes\nof the true time. Your options for\ntime killers are: get an item completely wet \nand watch it completely dry; unpack and repack\nevery item in your bags 10 times each;\nname 100 different real women; do 200 jumping jacks each; or play ten successful\nrounds of twenty questions. The obvious ones there\nseem to be 100 different real women \n200 jumping jacks  10 successful rounds\nof 20 questions. I don't know  I think\nwe could  with the right item  we could watch it dry\npretty quickly. And simultaneously\ndoing the other two. Yeah  'cause we can\nget to something plastic. Something plastic would\ndry pretty quickly. Yeah  okay. So we can look at the time now and then we just have\nto keep track of time. There's a clock.\nThere's a clock. We can't register the time\non any clocks. Yeah  so we need to\ngo somewhere that we can't. So let's find a good spot\nto do all of this. Alright. Hang on  hang on  hang on.\nI've got my lip balm. That's gonna dry. That'll dry instantly. We can dunk that in\njust a water bottle. So how about\nlet's go to this park? Yeah. I mean  there's\ntwo strategies really. It's either one of us focuses on telling time...\nYeah. And tries to get\nthe most accurate thing. Yeah. The other strategy\nis we both do it and average them out  because  you know.\nYeah. Did it say anything\nabout practicing telling time? No. Well  I know in\nprevious seasons  Adam just kept walking and was able to\ntell time that way. Do we just wanna keep\nwalking at a pace  figure out steps per minute \nsame as he did way back? I mean  I guess it worked. It worked very  very well. But that's probably\nbest done by one of us. Yes.\nI'm happy to... I'm happy to\nwalk at a pace. You're happy\nto walk in pace? Yeah  I'm happy\nto walk in pace. Okay  and then I'll\nwork on the other stuff? Yeah. Time how many steps\nI do in a minute. Alright  you ready?\nSo we're... Time  one minute. I'll keep metronomic\npace with my steps. I don't know if I'm\nas good as Adam at it  but I think it's the only way. So we're\nallowed to practice because we're not\nstarting yet  right? Yeah.\nOkay. Gimme one minute \nstarting... three  two  one  now. Four  three  two \none  done. 125. Every 125 steps \ngonna mark off one minute. The time is 09:38. And 15 seconds. Do we want to start at\nthe next full minute? No  I wanna start at 30 'cause that gives us\nthe most time either way. I guess that's true.\nFive minutes either way. Okay  then we\nhave nine seconds. So 09:38. Seven  six  five  Remember 09:38.\nfour  three  two  one. Go. Alright. So I am submerging\nour object. Ah! Okay. It's a little moist. Alright  Tom. Handoff. (muttering)\nSeven  eight  nine  70. One  two  three \nfour  five  six. Alright... Women. Michelle Obama. Sasha Obama. Malia Obama. Eight  nine  100 \none  two  three  four  five  six. I forget what the\nmama Obama's name is. Oprah  Ellen. Amy from\nJet Lag: The Game. Michelle Khare from\nJet Lag: The Game. Toby Hendy from\nJet Lag: The Game. Uhm... Uhm... Tom  are there more\nthan eight women? Okay. Welcome to the flughafen.\nAdam  we're at the flughafen. I love being\nhere at the flughafen. Let's just hope\nsecurity's not that bad. We're gonna be fine! Oh dude  not even a problem. It looks not that bad.\nWhat is this  a joke? What is Venus Williams'\nsister's name? Serena!\nSerena. Serena Williams. 25... 26. Uhm... 26. Sam  you need to\npick up the pace on this. I'm not good at this  Tom! Well  can you\nkeep this pace then? Yeah.\nOne tick  tick. Ready  start.\nSeven minutes. Two  three  four  five... Anneka Rice. Angela Merkel. I already did Angela Merkel. Annie Rauwerda \nAngela Rippon  Emma Bunton \nVictoria Beckham. And... Uhh... You're right  this is hard. Okay  well... We made it through \nno problem. Pretty good.\nLook. Everybody \nespecially Sam and Tom  they always like to talk about  \"Oh  security can be so\nbad at the airports  oh!\" Well  you know\nwhat else it can be? You know  it can be easy.\nEasy as hell. Nothing.\nAnd so... Guess what? What? You can go—\nyou can go— you— I don't know what\nI was gonna say. Okay. Eight minutes.\nWhat on Earth? Your brain goes empty. You're right  this is hard. Okay  Sam  I'm gonna\ntag you— tag out. 13  14  15  16  17 \n18  19  20  21  22  23. —4  25.\n67 women. How many minutes?\n14. 67 women. Oh  you're clearly much\nbetter at this than me. 68. My mom. Her name is Pamela. 69. My grandma. Her name is Donna. Tom  I'm so bad at this. Okay  trade off with me. How many do I have to get? 200! Women?\nYeah! I didn't realize it was 200. 200! We're not\ngonna get to that! Well  we don't\nhave another option other than 200\njumping jacks each. We should do that. You need to keep walking\nwhile I do my 200  and you need to\nkeep waving this. Yeah  I'm keeping walking.\nSorry  I'm getting distracted. Look at this.\nI've never seen one like this. It's like a travelator  but... Down.\nIt's got a slope. It's kind of intense  actually. This is wild. They're doing crazy\nstuff out here. Is this an airport\nor a damn rollercoaster? I mean  I feel like I am\nhaving the time of my life. Done!\nThree  four  five... Tell me when\nyou're on a minute. I'll start counting.\nHow many minutes? 24. One  two.\nThis is dry. People who tell you that you have to get to\nthe airport really early? It's a hoax. It's a hoax  folks. It's a hoax  folks. That's a good\nlittle catchphrase. Yeah  I know. I think it would be\na really charming way of starting a conspiracy theory. Right  that's\nwhat I was thinking. We're about to board\nthis flight to Rome. You gotta wonder... What are Sam and Tom up to?\nWhat they're up to. So they're in Breclav\nas expected. They're in like a... They're in like a park \nit looks like. It looks like they're\ndoing a challenge  so... It's just gonna depend on how long the challenge takes\nthem  I suppose  but... Let's hope\nthat the challenge takes them a really long time \nand then they fail it. That sounded really mean\ncoming out of my mouth. No  I think that's right. But that's what\nI want to happen. Yeah.\nAnd I'm a good person. There's a train in six minutes. Then there's a train at 11. And then there's\nnot another train as far as I can tell until 1.\nOkay. So they really need\nto make that train at 11  is my opinion on the matter. Hurry up  Sam and Tom. Or  don't  'cause again...\nDon't hurry up. As previously established \nGo slow  go slow. I would like you to take\na long time and then fail. Nine... 100. Done. Okay. I prefer you say this\n'cause I'm finding myself very easily distracted \nbut I have an object. Okay? No  I can't count\nand do 20 questions at the same time \nSam  I can't. I don't know where I am. I think 20 questions\nare our best bet. I have thoughts\non how to do this. The first one's gonna be hard. The next after that's\ngonna be easier. It's got an object  right?\nYep. Okay. 30. Dude  I— Sam  I can't \nI can't keep count and do this at the same time.\nTen! Seven  eight.\nName some women. We're on about\n30 minutes. Go! Let me do this.\nGo  go go  I'll name women. We're on 88.\nI think we need to do 20 questions. We're on 88. (bleep)\nTom  trust me. This will be easier\nin the long run. Okay  okay  fine.\n20 questions  51. Well if  if you\ncan count  can I ask? Sure. Okay  we need 10 rounds. Is it in this park?\nNo. Is it larger\nthan a breadbox? No. Is it something\nwe've used today? No. Is it something you\nencounter in everyday life? Not necessarily  no.\n31  you were on minute 30? Yeah.\nIs it something we can see? No.\nHere now? No  no. Is it something we have\nmade a reference to recently? Not that I\ncan remember  no. Is it edible?\nMmmmnnh... Not normally. Is it tied to\na certain country? No.\nDoes it have wheels? No. Is it associated\nwith the time of the year? No. Sam  this is slower\nthan naming women. Trust me  Tom.\nDoes it start with an A? No. With a B?\nNo. C?\nYes. Second letter  A?\nYes. Third letter  B?\nNo. L?\nNo. M?\nNo. M?\nNo. R?\nNo. Is it a car?\nNo. Is it a cardigan?\nNo. I'm outta questions. It was a\ntwo of hearts card. (exhales loudly) Okay! Yep  next round. Is it the three of hearts?\nYes. Lock it in.\nIs it the four of hearts? Yes.\nLock it in. Five of hearts?\nYes. Six of hearts.\nSeven of hearts. Eight of hearts.\nNine of hearts. Ten of hearts.\nJack of hearts. Yes.\nOne more. Queen of hearts. I think we're done.\nOkay. How many minutes\nare we on? It was really hard\nto keep track. Yes  it was. I think we're around 35. I will go for 36.\nOkay. Because I think we'll\nhave lost one somewhere. It was 38. That means that\nthe time must be zero... 14 minutes past the hour.\nYou sure? Lock it in? Let's say we lost one\nand go for 15. 15 minutes past the hour.\nSo 10:15? And we get five minutes\non either end. Yes.\nShould I check? Yeah  check it. 10:15  bring it in! Oh!\nCall them. Call them. Call them.\nCall them. Call them. Call them. Get in! Excellent metronomics. Excellent cards and sleuthing. Oh my god.\n(groans loudly) Oh  they're calling us. Well  they're gonna\ntake that train. Fail  fail  fail  fail \nfail  fail  fail  fail. Look  Adam Chase  you may have thought\nyou're the only one who can precisely guess down to the second \nwhat time it is. (wheezes)\nBut we just killed time. We wasted time for \nwhat  30? 35 or whatever. I don't care\nhow many minutes it is. The point is  we got Czechia.\nWe locked Czechia. Good luck wherever you're going.\nOkay. It's not great. It's not great for us. Hmm  the\nconnection's gone. Well... That's not great. That... They're moving buddy.\nThey're moving mighty fast. They're moving. We should take a look at\nwhat flights they might be able to get out of Vienna today. Because if they— if there's a good \nwell-timed flight... they... might be able to\nsnag three countries today. Four to five. It feels like we should\nbe winning by more. I feel like we've\nbeen doing so good. I know. I feel like\nwe've been doing so good. And yet we're only up by one\nand we're about to be tied. Well  but we're also\nabout to get one more and then one more after.\nThat's true. We need them to slow down. Slow down boys.\nSlow down boys. Alright  let's go to Slovakia.\nAlright. Let's go to Slovakia.\nLet's do it. Let's get that train. Okay. I'm just checking\nall the technicalities. It was fine. You could— you were\nabsolutely allowed to tell me it was the two of hearts\nafter the first round. That's in there.\nExcept... Except... There's actually\nonly 100 women. 100 women.\nAnd I'm sure— We were on 88. I'm not sure if\nthere's 200 women  but I'm sure there's\nat least 100. (sighs) Your mind\ncompletely blanks  by the way. Just last couple minutes \nI've been trying to think  what if it was men?\nNo  it's just as difficult. You just blank without\na category to go off. Nah  it's just a picture.\nYou saw me running— How long do we have\n'til our train? Like 30 minutes.\nOh. Do you wanna investigate\nan automated bike tower? Sure? There's no earlier train\nwe can take  right? Not that I know of\nunless there's a late train or something  but... You know what?\nThat's more important. Let's check. It's also worth checking\nwhether our actual train is on time  because...\nYeah. That could be important.\nYeah  it could. Okay  where are we going? Wait  Bratis—\nbut that's the one that theoretically\ndoesn't exist. What do you mean it\ntheoretically doesn't exist? The 10:20. And do you wanna go\non the platform to— Well  it's\ndelayed by 10 minutes  which means\nit's about to arrive  and it's direct to Bratislava. But that's\nthe one that has— you have to get\nseat reservations. Is that— That's RegioJet.\nLet's ask. Hello. Is English okay? English  yes.\nYeah. We have Interrail passes. Is it possible to get\na seat reservation on the 10:20 to Bratislava?\nThe late one? (bleep) me. There is a perfect flight from Vienna to\nCopenhagen  isn't there? There is one at 3:05 \nand it gets in at 4:50. (vocal fries) Is it really expensive? No  it's really cheap. That sucks. And that's what\ntheir plan is  isn't it? You find\nanything interesting? Adam  are you in\nthe right head space to receive information that could be\npotentially damaging to your mental health? Oh  no. No  I'm— I would say I'm not. Then I have\nnothing to report. Okay. Is there a flight to Copenhagen? Platform three. Not this one. Sam  this train... We were told\nthis train doesn't exist. Yeah. I mean— Not only were we told\nthis train doesn't exist  but if we had not checked... It should have left. It should have left\nfive minutes ago  but it's ten minutes late. Yeah  I mean... Who knows whether it exists\nuntil it shows up  but... I know  well \nwe just got sold a seat reservation on it. We just got sold\na seat reservation. It'd be weird for\nthere to be a delay on a train that doesn't exist.\nRight? Look  don't celebrate yet\nuntil the train shows up. No  no  I won't.\nBut if we get this... we have a few minutes\nin Bratislava  right? Yeah. Sorry  I'm really\nsuddenly enthusiastic. Have you noticed?\n(wheezes) No.\nIt might be the sudden realisation\nthat we might get a train  or it might be\nthe 200 jumping jacks. Wait  I'm just texting Adam to let him know that\nwe also guessed it down to the second. Oh  yeah  yeah \nyeah  absolutely. I just want him to know.\nYeah. Sam is texting us to clarify how good they did\nat that challenge. He's clearly very excited. Who even freaking cares? We are unfazed\nbecause we are about to have the papacy under our control  and then we will\nhave God smite them. If they're gonna get to\nBratislava  what... Are they\nalready on their way? I think probably  yes.\nThey probably made the train. Oh  come on. Please tell me\nthey're still there. Sam.\nYeah? Train! It exists.\nIt exists. Do you think it's a mirage? This is the RegioJet.\nGrab your bag. We're going to Bratislava on a train that\napparently doesn't exist. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Hello. We've escaped\nour white void. And why?\nI will tell you in a second. But first  I have to tell you\nthat the next episode of Jet Lag is up\nright now on Nebula  but more importantly \ndot dot dot  Adam? Abolish Everything!\nis a new show that we are producing\nthat is exclusive to Nebula. It's not on YouTube at all except for some clips. We're on the set of it right now and we would like\nto tell you about it. It is a comedy debate show where comedians argue\nwhy some pet peeve that they have should be\nabolished from society forever. I was on the show recently  and I argued that we should\nabolish the dentist. And then once you have made\nyour presentation  then the Political Establishment \nwho sits here  this is a panel of improvisers. We – boo – we hate\nthe Political Establishment. They would like for everything\nto stay the same. They argue for the status quo.\nSo they will argue then with the comedian \nthey'll grill them with questions  trying to suggest that\nwe should not abolish whatever it is that the comedian\nwould like to abolish. And then at the end \nthe audience chooses the winner  who returns for the\nworld championship season finale. And yeah  that's the show. It's a very wholesome \nfamily-friendly show. It's not wholesome or\nfamily friendly. I wouldn't show it\nto small children. But... But if you're a... bigger than a large child... I would check it out\nto be earnest. To be earnest for a moment. We have been working\nquite hard on it. We've been here since\nthis morning. We're going to be here all night. And we've been working on\nevery episode. I mean  Sam and Adam\nspent like an hour just sanding down this sign so that it would look... Yeah  it looked...\nIt was too shiny before but now it looks good.\nLess clean. And  you know  we've made all these messed up props\nand everything. Yeah  we just think that\nthis show is really special  and we're really excited\nto be working on it. And we really think that\nif you like the... the dumb sort of stuff\nwe say on our show that you'll like the dumb\nsort of stuff they say on this show even more. It's very funny.\nHere's the thing. Here's my personal plea. Zoom in on my face. Get zoomed  get zoomed. No  no  we can do it\ndigitally. Don't. No  no.\nOkay  zoom it out. I don't like most\ncomedy shows personally. Is that right? I think that that's fair to say.\nI think that's true. I'm not a big comedy—\nI'm not a comedy head. I don't watch stand-up. I don't do that sort of thing. This show  though?\nI love it. It's funny. It's like I watched this\nfive  six  seven times just in the editing process. And each time \nI'm laughing again. which is crazy... to... still laugh at the same joke\nseven times. It's true. That's to say \nwhether or not you identify as\na big comedy head or not  I think you'll like it.\nGo to nebula.tv/jetlag.

        "transcript": "Welcome back to episode four of our race to claim\nthe most countries in Europe. Right now  the score is 5-4 with Ben and Adam having\nclaimed Liechtenstein  locked Switzerland  and stolen Germany \nFrance  and Austria. Right now  they're about to board\na flight from Zurich to Rome so they can claim\nItaly and Vatican City. Meanwhile  Tom and I have\nclaimed the Netherlands and locked Belgium \nHungary  and Czechia  which we did right at\nthe end of the last episode. We then planned to make\nour way towards Slovakia  which we expected to take a while \nbut it turned out that the train we had been told didn't exist \ndid in fact exist. So now we're headed to Bratislava ahead of schedule with\na plan to lock it quickly and make our way back\nto Vienna Airport and catch a flight to Copenhagen. Sam.\nYeah? Train! It exists.\nIt exists. Do you think it's a mirage? This is the RegioJet.\nGrab your bag. We're going to Bratislava on a train that\napparently doesn't exist. Thank you very much  Czechia. Okay  Sam.\nWhat are the lads doing? They're at the airport. Flight AZ571 to Rome. Gate A72. Is that exactly where they are? That's where they are. Unless they're deliberately\ngoing to the wrong gate to throw us off... Yeah  but we'll\nlearn pretty soon when the plane starts\ntaxiing  but... And as soon as\nthat plane starts taxiing  we book to Copenhagen. I have news  Tom.\nOkay. You think it's\ngood news or bad news? I mean  you haven't\ndropped your croissant. I'm just trying to scare you.\nWe're actually already in Slovenia. Or Slovakia.\nWhat? We passed the border?\nYeah. Was that bridge the... I don't know if\nthat was it  but... Oh  I'll text 'em. Maybe. Wait  you have to do\na bunch of emojis and stuff. Okay  yeah. Oh  wow. Well...\nOkay  well... It would seem that\nthey did make the train out of Breclav. They have already\nclaimed Slovakia. They got straight\nto Bratislava. I'd say that\nthings are looking... not so good for us\nand very good for... their chances of getting\na flight out of Vienna before the end of the day. Yeah  we have to really hope\nthat this Slovakia challenge trips them up hard. Oh  they are speeding up. I do not like that. I do not like that\none bit  Adam. Tom  what did you\nput in the message? I put Slovenia.\nAnd where are we? Sl— Slovakia. Mhm. I knew someone was\ngonna make that mistake. I am embarrassed\nthat it's me. Okay. We are nearly at Bratislava. What time do we have\nto be on that bus? 12:20. We've got about... 45  50 minutes in Bratislava. We might as well\npull the challenge. Might as well pull it.\nSee if we can do it. But I think we need\nto be on that bus no matter what.\nNo matter what. We have to be on a 12:20 bus.\nYep. The time now is... 11:40. 40 minutes. Some challenges have\nbeen done in that time. Let's go. Thank you. Okay. Alright  welcome to Slovakia. Welcome to Bratislava.\nAlright. Should I pull it?\nPull it. Let's hope this is good. Visit one castle per capita. Slovakia has the highest\nnumber of castles per capita in the world. Your team must enter\n(or get within 10 meters of) two castles within\nan hour of reading this card. At each castle  one team member\nmust wear a crown (any pointy hat) and make a royal decree\non the subject of your choosing. Oh  I  I don't know  Tom. What? They're in a very\ndifferent area of town. Oh  they're in a\nvery different area of town. There's one just there  and then there's\na presidential palace. I guess it's technically a palace. A palace is not\nnecessarily a castle. I'll check the rules  but... Yeah  I'll check\nthe rules as well. Anything with \"Castle\" or \"Palace\"\nin its name counts. Okay.\nWe can run  right now... There. In fact  there's loads.\nLet's go  there's two. Come on  lock in. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.\nI know. I'm just tightening\nmy backpack. We just have to\nget within 10 metres  wear a pointy hat \nand make a royal decree. I'm pretty sure we can improvise\na pointy hat with something. Wait.\nWhat? Check the trash can\nfor paper. I don't see any.\nOkay  but good plan. How far is the closest? Across the road—\nThere! That's it. That is by Slovakian standards\nand by the standards of my map  that yellow thing is a palace. Now we need...\nhat materials. Yes  we do. We're gonna improvise\nfrom our packs here  Sam. I think we need\nto get up here and... Yeah  up  over this  across. The only paper I have is...\nchallenge materials. We can make\na very small pointy hat. That'll do. There are no restrictions\non pointy hat size. Okay. Look through the packs. We've gotta be able\nto make something. I mean  I have\nthe challenge card from... Yes! Yes  yes  yes  yes  yes.\nChallenge card. Go  go  go  go  go. Alright  so... Which way do we wanna do this?\nThis way 'round. I declare that\nto be a pointy hat. Is that pointy enough for you? It's pretty pointy.\nI think that's a pointy hat. I hereby decree\nthat I will not get any flack for confusing Slovenia\nand Slovakia earlier. Despite the fact that\nI sent the message with a load of emphasis\nand emojis. I think you're only subject to this royal decree\nif you're Slovakian. That's fine by me! But that's probably the people that are\nmost subject to... Yep! Alright  come on!\nNext castle! Oh no! It's up there? It's up there.\nHow far up? Top of the stairs. 12:20 for the bus  right? Lock in Tom. Lock in. No  hang on.\nI don't believe this. This is not a castle.\nThis is stairs. This is marked as stairs. Alright  we're going\nto the Pistori Palace. Next right  down here.\nHow far? Same distance again. See the colonnade there?\nIt's on the sign. Palace.\nIt's on the sign  Sam. With speed  please.\nI need you to swap out your hat. I'm gonna do my hair. Sam – Hat. Decree. Go! I decree that... if you are the pilot of the... ITA Airways flight\nfrom Zurich to Rome  that's in the air right now... you decide that you want to go on\na little vacation in Algeria  divert there  spend\na couple of days there  check out the beaches. Maybe strand Ben and Adam? Okay  so they just... made an announcement\non the flight... that... there's been an issue\nand we are being rerouted. Where are we going? We are now going... ...to the Snack Zone  baby! Welcome to The Snack Zone. We have been served\nfood on this flight. It's very exciting. Today we'll be trying this... pizza raft.\nSort of a raft of pizza. The main taste I'm getting\nis hot. That's it. That's claimed. We have the country.\nWe have the country! Sam  we have— we've got—\nwe've locked it! Sam...\nThat was pretty good. Lock it in! Come on! Okay  they're not answering. Alright  so—\n'Cause they're in the air. Let's record a little message. Hey gents.\nHey. We... We've just both become\nmonarchs of the... Slovakia. Yeah.\nCrazy how that happens. Locked— Country locked. Enjoy Rome? Bye!\nBye! Come on  let's get that bus! That is the Vienna run\nall locked up  and we got three of them. Slower than we wanted \nbut we've locked three of them. That was pretty good.\nThat was pretty good. Alright. Welcome to Rome. \"Bienvenue al Italia.\" Buongiorno and all the others. That means that is Italy claimed. I think \"bienvenue\"\nprobably actually wasn't Italian at all  was it? Oh  okay  well \nbut you could still say it here. Yeah  there's no law\nagainst saying it here. We got a text from them\nthat they locked Slovakia which I would say is\npretty bad news. So this is sort of quite bad and that they would definitely\nbe able to fly out... at the end of today... probably... to Copenhagen. Yeah. You think just\ngo ahead and book? Yeah. I just got a text  I imagine. Yeah. Well... At least we made the right plan. We made the right plan. Let's hope we get to the airport. That does make it 6-5. We'll do what we can.\nMhm. We're still playing catch-up. Look at the guards. Can I see it? It's terrible.\nIt's a terrible shot. Uh-huh. But you might have been\nable to briefly see a castle in it. And I believe that was\nAdam's end location in Tag 3.\nYep. Oh  we got city walls\nover this side. It's very pretty. It's not the greatest\nbus tour in the world  but I feel like we've seen\na bit more of Bratislava now. It's a lot cheaper than most... Yeah.\n...tourist buses. Alright. I'm a fan. I'm satisfied. There we go.\nThere's the big... There's... Is there\nan Adam there? Ahh  no. This is the river Danube.\nOh  really? So long  Slovakia.\nWe are back in Austria. We need to get\nto the Vatican. Yep. We took a look\nat all of the flights and there's just nothing\nthat's makeable today. So I think that today\nwe just have to focus on locking both of these countries. We'll go back to the airport. We'll finish our day at the airport \nand we'll take a flight first thing in the morning\nout of here. I think that's all we can do. But look  we're up and we're\nabout to get another country. Yeah  yeah. Alright  we gotta find\nthe bus to the Vatican. Back at the airport. Back at the airport. (sighs loudly) Okay.\nOkay. Well...\nLet's go check in. Yep. I got no idea...\nHow to get across. How to get\nacross the damn street. Oh  underpass.\nOh  great. ♫ (hums faux-Italian melody) (scatting) Alright  alright  alright.\nHere we go. Ben... This is the Vatican.\nThis is the border? This is it.\nOkay. Vatican City has been claimed. Now we're in the Vatican.\nWoo-hoo. We are gonna try\nto be kind of chill here because it is the Vatican.\nYou know... We aren't trying to\nbe disrespectful. Look  they have\na Christmas tree. Ooh. That's fun. I guess they would\nlike Christmas here. I guess that would make sense. Not that many people\nare filming. So I think it's all good. Are you ready to get\nthe Vatican challenge? I'm ready for it. Okay  let's see\nwhat we got here. Create the Creation\nof Adam  Adam (or Ben or Sam or Tom). Create the\nCreation of Adam  Adam (or Ben or Sam or Tom). The Vatican is home to one of\nMichelangelo's most famous works: The Creation of Adam  located on the ceiling\nof the Sistine Chapel. You must recreate\nThe Creation of Adam as Michelangelo did. Your artwork must be above you\nduring its entire creation. It must then be correctly\nidentified by your audience through a Google Form. Easy  easy  easy. So it says— That's a very\nrecognizable painting. Um.\nUm. We just need a pen\nand a piece of paper. There is a souvenir store\nat the tourist information office. So why don't we try to do that \nwhich is  I think is this way. Okay. Here we go. Yeah  pens  postcards. Oh  and in fact  we've got\nthe Creation of Adam pen. Okay. Yeah  let's get one of these magnets\nto look at to reference. Wait  what about these? That works. No problem. Perfetto. Alright. We've got\nour materials. Adam? Here's the fact of the matter. We have to do this thing \nwhich is kind of silly... here in the Vatican. And so  I think we just\nneed to try to find the spot where it's gonna be\nthe most chill for us to be doing something\na little silly. Would you like to draw it \nor shall I? I thought you did\na very good job on George Wormington. Thank you. Alright  I am happy to do it. Maybe over there. That feels like it wouldn't\nbe that sacrilegious. I think here seems just fine. I've got my reference.\nYep. Gonna lay down.\nTake a little lay down. It's also really important... you should hold it up pretty high because my whole body has\nto be below it at all times. Right. How's that?\nIt's pretty good. Bring it down. Okay  here we go. Is it looking perfect? Yeah  it looks perfect.\nGreat. I'm getting his muscles\nand stuff really good. That is one of the\nmost important parts. So here's a— something to— that I would like you\nto know  Ben. In my mind's eye \nAdam has a little leaf over kinda his... his peen. Yeah. Is that not the case? Nope  it's straight out. It's all... It's all hanging out. Here in Italy  they...\ndo things a little differently. Oh no  this pen\ncan't write anymore. On account of\npotentially the ink. So you hold that up there.\nI'm gonna get the pen working. Oh  you're doing very good. I would say this is pretty... pretty perfect. Okay  I got it.\nGot it going again? Okay. Great  we're good. I wonder if the Pope\nwould like Jet Lag: The Game. I think... he would. There's a very aggressive\nseagull here that is attacking\nall the other birds. I mean  I really...\nI actually  at this point... I don't want to\novercomplicate things. So I'm just gonna\nsort of  just put a little... little bit of texture.\nMhm  yeah. Some shading  wow. You are the modern day\nMichelangelo. Alright.\n10 more seconds of work. Okay.\nYou're free to stop whenever. Okay  I'm done.\nI think I'm done. Okay  well...\nCamera  there you have it. This is Adam's\nCreation of Adam. I don't think there's any\nroom for interpretation here. No  that's\nThe Creation of Adam. I think that's... If you put this on the ceiling\nof the Sistine Chapel  no one would notice. Right  no one could\neven tell the difference. Okay. I'm just setting up\na Google Form now. And then we run it\nfor 15 minutes. We do have to remain vigilant. Did you know that this country has\nthe highest crime rate in the world? So I say we spend\nthe next 10 minutes seeing if we can find the Pope. Yep  I bet\nhe's here somewhere. There's only a few guys\nwho live here  and the Pope is one of 'em.\nYep. You'd think we'd be\nable to track him down. Not up there. Do you see him? Nothing. Nothing? You'd think he'd\ncome out to greet us for visiting his house. Maybe he's hiding\nin the fountain. Well  this is his bathtub. No. I guess we wouldn't wanna show him\nin the nude anyway. No. How many more\nminutes on our time there? Five.\nFive minutes. Okay  you guys better\nbe good at art. Okay  15 minutes have passed. Here  let's go stand\nin front of the beautiful... Benjamin  the time has come to see if our audience\nknows about culture. Yep. We got\na lot of responses. Or if they're\na bunch of jokers. How many responses total? We currently have\n1 204 responses. Now  Google Forms\nsummarizes the responses to what the\nmost popular ones are. Okay  let's see. And so when I click\nover to this tab here  the audience can see it first. Is it— Is it— Yeah  we're good. I wanna know what the top non-Creation of Adam\nresponses— Mona Lisa got 10. (chuckles)\nMona Lisa got 10. Yeah.\nOkay. Alright  well that was\nno problem at all. And now it's time to call We have locked the Vatican!\n...Sam and also Tom as well. Green lights. Oh. Hello. Greetings from the Vatican.\nGreetings. Now  a lot of people\nthink that... the Pope is in charge\nof Vatican City. Not so.\nNot so. What they don't realize\nis that in fact  we are in charge of\nVatican City in the sense that we have\nnow locked Vatican City. That means... Catholicism is on our side. That's true.\nSo good luck dealing with that. Yeah.\nFolks. Um  so...\nwhere are you going? Is it  uh... Copenhagen or is it\nsomewhere else? Somewhere else. What'd you do in the Vatican City? Oh  do we have our art? Sam  what piece of art is that?\nWhat's this? (chuckles) Is that a Banksy? Yeah  yeah.\nYeah. Alright.\nCongrats. Alright  well...\nBye. I hope that your plane explodes. Before you're on it.\nNot when you're on it. I hope no one's on it. I hope no one's on the plane. How would no one be\non the plane at all? I hope no one's on it \nbut then it explodes  so then they can't go\nwhere they're going. Okay.\nYeah  I agree with that. Bye. (sighs) Well... we did good work here. Alright Ben  we need\nto go back into Italy... and then we need to\npull the Italy challenge and then we need to\ndo it fast enough that we can end the day\nat the airport so that we can take\nan early flight probably to Amsterdam  but we will confirm exactly what we're gonna do later out.\nWe'll figure it out. I'm gonna take this home\nand tape it to my ceiling. Okay. Here we go. Are you ready to go\nback to Italy? ♪ I'm goin' there ♪ Aaaand Italy. Welcome back to Italy. I've got our Italy\nchallenge right here. We can open it\nwhen we are ready. Okay  well... Welcome back to Italy. We're back in Italy  baby. Now  it is time to lock Italy \nwhich we need to do before we go\nto the airport tonight. Are you ready?\nI'm ready. Here is our challenge\nfor Italy. Limbo in limbo. Limbo in limbo. The Italian writer  Dante \nis best known for Inferno: a book detailing his fictionalized\njourney through hell. In Inferno  the first circle of hell\nis known as \"limbo \" which is where you're\nheaded for this challenge. First you must get underground (ie. fully below street level \nout of view of the sun). Then you must limbo:\nRoll two dice. One of the values will be the height in feet that\nyou must limbo under  and the other will be\nhow many attempts one of your team members\nhas to limbo under it. That is terrifying. If it's too... Ugh! I mean  I don't think\nwe could limbo anything under certainly three feet. Could we even limbo\nunder three feet? Could you limbo\nunder three feet? I don't know that I could\nlimbo under three feet. Well  you're shorter than me.\nWell  let's see. You know \nhow do you limbo good? I don't know. Like that? I don't know\nhow high that was. No. Okay  well  I guess\nlet's roll our stupid dice. Oh  we have to get underground. Yeah  let's just go\nback to the tunnel. Look  here's one thing. We get two numbers and one of them is just\nnumber of attempts  right? Right.\nThat is a lot less important. No  obviously... whatever the higher number is\nwill be the height. As long as we get one\nthat's a four or higher  I think we're fine. When we were walking\nfrom the Vatican  we walked into a tunnel\nunder a bridge. Right. So  we figure... that's our limbo. I'm just really scared. There's a decent chance that\nthis is completely impossible. No  if we roll\ntwo numbers under four  I think we are... uhh... in trouble. God. All this effort to get to Italy and this is what it's\ngonna come down to. Oh god. So Tom  I think it's\nworth discussing what we do when we get to Copenhagen. Yeah  'cause we spent a lot\nof time researching just then. I'm of the belief\nthat if we can  we should get on a train\nto Malmö tonight. Yes.\nBecause... Then we could do...\nMalmö challenge... come back to the airport. Yeah  I mean  it leaves us\nthe maximum flexibility with already have claimed Sweden.\nYes. We get back to 7-7.\nYeah  we do. And then if  for some reason \nwe would decide we wanna get some flight that requires us\ngoing directly to the airport in the morning  we can.\nYep. Okay.\nAlright. Let's get to Malmö if we can. 'Bout a 90 minute flight?\nWe'll be there. Let's hope that we\npush back quickly. Uh-huh. And if we're luck— And let's just hope\nthat the lads  you know  screw up the Italy challenge. Okay  folks. We have made it back\nto the tunnel where we are underground. We are in limbo  as it were. So now it's time to roll our dice. In a very real sense  these dice rolls will determine\nthe fate of Italy. Okay  we're gonna say\nroll a die. We need... Four  five or six. Here we go. Here we go. You wanna use my phone? Yeah  maybe you have\nbetter service. (sighs) Oh my god.\nYeah  okay. Okay  are you ready?\nYep. Oh  there it goes. Ohhh! There we go  baby.\nOkay  that's a five. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine.\nLet's see... Let's roll another one. Three.\nThree. We get three attempts\nto go under five feet. That should not be\nany problem at all. I think we can do that. Oh  thank god. Wow. It says that this is five \nwhich seems approximately right. Just do not touch my arm. Wonderful stuff. And that is Italy locked. Let's call them. Okay. My guess is that\nthey are on a plane. Yep. A plane to Copenhagen. Boys  are you on— Can we look sad this time?\nLook sad. Boys  are you on\na plane to Copenhagen? They're not gonna pick up. No  look  actually\nlike as be believable. That's how I look when I'm sad. That's a very quick call. That was quick. Hello!\nIt was quick. It was quick. We... Do you wanna know\nwhy it was quick? We have locked Italy. It's 'cause we're so\ngood at Jet Lag: The Game! Because we're really\ngood at Jet Lag: The Game and we've locked Italy. Oh  they hung up. Well  they were so angry\nthey hung up. Okay.\nThey're on the plane almost certainly to Copenhagen. Which is not awesome news for us  especially considering\nthat we have now quite a bit of dead time here\nat the end of the day. There goes the\nsteal Italy and Vatican plan. It wasn't a plan. It was a hope. It was a hope  yeah. Here's the upside. They have two and a half hours I don't think they can\ndo anything useful of. Oh no  they get\ntwo and a half hours in a very beautiful\npart of the world where the weather's usually good. Yeah  but they\ncan't do anything useful. That's true. Okay. Well  Ben  the two challenges\nthat we had the most time for were the ones that took\nthe least amount of time. Yes. Because now\nwe have  what? We have about three hours. We've got three\nbasically totally dead hours. Which is never good. No  'cause we just\nwant to go to the airport. 'Cause we want to take a flight.\nLet's look. Let's look at what flights\nwe wanna take out tomorrow morning. And in the meantime... we're going somewhere fun.\nYeah. Okay. What the hell is this thing? This is just like \nyou go to a place in Europe  and you're like \n\"What is that? What is that?\" And they're like \nit's the public library. But what is that? The Altare della Patria \nI think. I don't even know what that is.\nNever heard of that. But look at that!\nNever heard of that. Never heard of that\n(bleep) before. You want a\nSaure Glühwürmchen? Damn  those are just good. I know it. Oh my god. They're carrying\nsomething very important. It's the trophy. Yeah. (laughs)\nThat's the Jet Lag trophy. That's the trophy. They're transporting it to\nour end location right now. That's crazy. Crazy stuff down there. It's crazy to be\nwhere ancient Rome was. And it's like  I wonder\nif they ever thought about how Jet Lag: The Game\nwould be played here. Right. It's like they probably\nthought about that. Do you think that\nthey were ever like  \"I wish we were\nin the Snack Zone\"? Well  probably a lot. I think a lot of them starved. Hello. Buongiorno to... the Colosseum. Look  here's what I wanna say. Gladiator and Gladiator II. Think about how much\nmoney they spent to do like a big CGI build whatever  the Colosseum \nget it in their movie. We got a Colosseum in our show. Paid— Did for free. Jet Lag—\nGot it for free for us. Yep  Jet Lag: The Game. Well actually \nI guess they had to build it a long time ago. But they did that for\nJet Lag: The Game. Right. It probably cost\na lot of money though. Okay  Ben. I think it's decision time. 'Cause I would like to\ngo ahead and book a flight. Yes  I would say we have two main routes  right? We've got the safe route.\nYeah. Yeah. Where we go somewhere\nlike Spain or Portugal. Yeah  we get two.\nGet an easy two. An easy open two. Or...\nOr... We've got the riskier route  which is that we go\nto Amsterdam and we try to steal it  and then we try to catch a flight out of Amsterdam\nto somewhere else. That... would also\nprobably get us two. But it would net us three because it would take\none away from them. But it has the possibility for us to only get one\nif we fail. And we know that the\nNetherlands challenge is hard because it's the only one\nthat's been failed That's true.\n...all season. Not everything. I have only\nthe Orange Gerbaras. Uh-huh. Christmas Rose is Finnish.\nAhh. Alstroemeria \nI don't have that. Okay.\nNot now  and not anymore. And Mimosas \nnot from this time. Alright. We have been given\na duff challenge I think. Here's the thing.\nYep. If we can't get\nChristmas Rose... Yep— They can't\nget Christmas Rose. (laughs ecstatically) Ben  Adam. If you somehow come\nto the Netherlands and you are able to find plants\nthat are not in season from an actual florist...\nYeah. Honestly  they kinda\ndeserve that at that point. Well  the one thing that\nI almost sort of like about this is that they don't know\nwhy this is failable. Yes. Yeah  they don't.\nUntil they do. So they might be coaxed\nto come to the Netherlands with something that—\nIt sounds like it's not impossible. Some flower shops might\nstill have Christmas Rose. Yeah. But it's a—\nIt's for Christmas. Yeah.\nAnd it's now not Christmas. Ohh! But I just think\nthat we're so good at Jet Lag: The Game.\nThat's what I think. I think...\nI think it's Netherlands. I'm gonna book the flight. And that also means if Sam and Tom mess up\nany of these challenges... Denmark or Sweden... We are gonna be right\nnext to those countries. We're gonna be\nright on top of them and then we'll just\ngo snatch those up. So they have gotta be\non top of the ball. Conformed. Alright  that's that then. We're going to Amsterdam and we are going to\nbe trying to liberate the great nation of the Netherlands\nfrom Tom and Sam tomorrow. Well  they have\na very tyrannical grip on the nation of the Netherlands\nThey do. and it needs to be liberated.\nIt's so messed up! It's so messed up! Ben  let's go to the airport. We have to end the day there\nbecause our flight is at 8:25  55 minutes after\nthe game day starts. And so we need to be\nin front of the security area ...when we end the day\nso that we can start exactly there. Alright  off to the airport. That's the thing on the left. That's Denmark. I'll text them. 7-6.\n7-6. Well  unless there's some\nsurprise waiting for us  that's 7-6. If you want to tie the game back up \neven if it's not locked... 5:02 you said the train to Malmö gets us all the way there? And the 5:08...\nwill get us into Sweden into a decent enough station. We're not gonna try\nchallenges tonight  but if we can get the 5:02 or 5:08 \nwe'll tie the game up. That's currently 4:47 \nso... get ready to jump out. Okay  well... looks like they just\ntouched down in Copenhagen. So they got Denmark. Not locked. They have not locked it.\nAnd they may never lock it. That's certainly\nwhat we can hope for. Again  it's like we're going\nfirst thing tomorrow to Amsterdam. We'll be right by there. If they mess up this\nchallenge tomorrow... (whoosh)\n(clap) Pyeew. We go get 'em. Come on. Let's go  go  go  go.\n4:59. Are we at the furthest pier?\nMaybe. Three minutes at most. Track one. No  hang on. Track one there. That was an interesting move. Yeah  it was. Make sure our ticket's\nvalid  Sam. I got two minutes spare. Ohh. Copenhagen Airport. Malmö. If this says not valid 'cause\nit's some fancy train  I swear. Well  we have time to get\ntickets for the next one if so. 16:59.\nThere we go. Save journey. Glad we got the Interrail pass\n'cause that... just got us a ticket to Malmö.\nNice. How do you feel\nlike today went  Ben? They caught up. They caught up. They made up a lot of ground today. They had a very good day. So I feel like we gotta really\nkick it into high gear tomorrow. You know? Yeah. I would say\nthat today was not... It was not our strongest showing.\nNo. Hey  Sam.\nYep. When do we hit Sweden? I think it's at the maritime border. 'Cause we're on—\nYeah. Or it's gonna be on that\nlittle island in the middle? I think so. Yeah.\nYeah. That  I think... is gonna be across\nthe maritime border. Three  two  one. That's it.\nThat's Sweden. It's a tied game  Tom.\nIt's a tied game. It's a tied game. It doesn't feel like a tied game. Well  Ben... They have claimed Sweden... Which does make the game tied. They kinda got our ass today. Yeah  they did good. We got two today.\nThey got four today. I think tomorrow \nAmsterdam's the right move. I think the thing is... if we flub Amsterdam... I think we're gonna\npotentially be behind. There's Denmark  Sam. That's the best shot I can\nget of Denmark right now. Do you mean Sweden  Tom? That's Sweden  Sam. That's the best view I can\nget of Sweden right now. You're doing great. Good luck.\nThank you. So Tom \nwe have three minutes left in our game day.\nYes. It might just\nbe worth discussing first moves for tomorrow. I mean  there's a good play maybe\nby going to Helsinki or Tallinn. There are flights in kind of \nI think there was a 1 pm and 3 pms to both. Whatever happens  we need to at least\ntry to lock Sweden and Denmark tomorrow.\nOr— And then—\nOr one of the two. One of— Yeah  okay  fair. Because keep in mind\nthe potential option of we lock one of the two\nand get the earlier flight  it's a more aggressive move  but...\nIt is. We probably need to\nbe aggressive at this point. That's true. Either way  the clock up there\nis actually running... Oh  a clock on a train station\nshould not run late. It is 17:29 and\n20-something seconds. We got 30 seconds to strategise. What do you wanna talk about\nfor 30 seconds  Tom? I think I'm gonna\ntalk strategy with you 'cause we can't during\nthe rest period. What are you\ngonna have for dinner? Look  Tivoli Gardens is\nclosed over in Copenhagen. I'm already annoyed I'm not\ngoing on rollercoasters. I'm gonna have\nSwedish meatballs. Look  we got like 15 seconds. I think we try to\nlock both countries. But  who knows where\nthe lads are going. That might make a difference.\nYeah  we'll see. I don't know. Three  two... You wanna just double check? Alright  welcome to the airport. I'm checking to make sure\nthat we have both the phones. We're so scared\nthat we might lose And we do.\nthese filming phones. Okay. Welcome to the airport. Okay. Well  Ben... It's 5:30 pm. Which means\nthe game day has ended. Yep. I think that  you know \nwe did okay today. We did okay.\nThey did better for sure. They had a much better day.\nAnd you know what? We took the safe route today\nand I think... Yeah  I think\nit did not pay off. I think it didn't pay—\nI think  tomorrow? Full send.\nYeah. Tomorrow  we try to\nsteal the Netherlands. If we succeed  that's huge. If we fail  I would say\nthat's very bad. But we're gonna see what happens. The boys are gonna\ndraw some blood tomorrow. See you tomorrow morning\nat this exact spot. (smooches) Three  two  one. Day four  Tom. Day four. Good morning. Good morning. Should we maybe go\nin the station where it's warmer and make a plan?\nYeah  yeah. Well  I think our plan  Sam  has to be...\nthat we lock both countries. If we— or at least we try to.\nWe cannot leave two undefended. We can't really\nleave one undefended. I agree we\ndefinitely can't leave two. I think there's a possibility\nit might be strategically beneficial if only doing one gets us\nonto a better flight. Maybe  but these are such \nsuch easy to get to countries. Yeah.\nThere are so many flights. On that note  I think I might\nknow what the lads are doing. I think I worked it out last night  but I now need to actually\nresearch and check. So  we know they ended\nright at Rome Airport. Yeah.\nAs far in as they could go. So my theory is\nthey're taking an early flight. And I think... I think they're trying to take the 08:25 to Amsterdam. Okay! Good morning.\nGood morning. It is day four. And lemme tell you... I'm starting to get\na little bit smelly. We did not pack\nso many clothes this time. Well  it is\nwe didn't have room 'cause we had to\nbring the little bags because of the European\nbudget airlines. Nothing you can do about that. There is something\nwe can do about. Winning this freaking game. And I would say\nmore specifically  going to the wonderful\ncountry of the Netherlands. Yep  and that is\nwhat we are about to do. I sure hope they are.\nI sure hope they are. 'Cause we think that challenge is – I'm not gonna say impossible – but it is basically\nfind flowers that are out of season. It's not an impossible\nchallenge  I don't think  but it's the most\ndifficult challenge we've had so far. It's the likeliest one\nfor them to fail. They haven't\nfailed a challenge yet. Yeah. They don't know how hard\nthe challenges can get. Yeah. And in fact  Benjamin... here's our gate. We've made it. We will board this plane\nto Amsterdam. Literally no\nfreaking problem at all. Are they scared? Are they feeling good\nthat we're going to the Netherlands? I just don't know. I think they're terrified. They better be terrified. They should be quaking\nin their freaking boots. I think they're\ngonna get there  think they're gonna\ntry and defeat us. And here's the thing. If they do get that challenge \nit's devastating for us. Yeah.\nBut if they don't... I see that... to be honest  that's the way\nthat they like to play. In which case \nshould we pull a challenge and defend Sweden? I think we better.\nAlright  Sam. I think after we do this \nwe need to have a real question on whether it's worth...\nYes. On what flight we want to take.\nBut I know that we— But it's gonna depend on\nwhether we get this or not. We need to lock\none of these countries. Should I pull it? Yeah  pull it.\nPull it  pull it  pull it. Oh  let's hope this is\ngood  Tom. The time is 7:33. Go. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Ooh boy! It looks like maybe\neverybody is in trouble? It's... It's... This is a tense moment\nhere in Jet Lag: The Game. Big moment for\nSwedes and Dutch people. Indeed. But good news for you. As you can see what happens\nright now  because the next episode\nis up right now on Nebula. You know  you want to know\nwhat else is up right now on Nebula? Not only the next episode  but the Layover podcast\nabout the next episode  and in fact  the Layover podcast\nabout every episode. Because we recap\nevery episode of Jet Lag on the Layover podcast\nexclusively on Nebula. You can't listen to that stuff\nanywhere but Nebula. You could do a fun game\nwhere you spoil the next episode for yourself\nby listening to The Layover. You could listen to The Layover before you watch the episode.\nThat could be interesting. That would— Don't do that. I don't think you should do it. I think it'd be a fun game. What else can you do\nwith a Nebula subscription? That's a great question. There's all sorts of Originals by talented creators. There's been a good number\nof really ambitious  exciting fiction projects\nfrom the past year and more to come. For example  you can watch\nDracula's Ex-Girlfriend  you can watch Identiteaze \nboth great. Or if you go real back\ninto the archives  you could watch\nPatrick Willems' Christmas special. We're in that.\nWe're in that. We're in that. Or his Night of the Coconut.\nNight of the Coconut. One of the greatest cinematic\nachievements of all time. He's making a new one that...\nthe cast has been announced. Yeah  it's in post-production. Yeah.\nIt's been shot and everything. It's coming out in\na couple months  I think. Really excited for that. TLDR... ...is on Nebula. That is true. TLDR is on Nebula as a Nebula...\n(wheezes profusely) There's a TLDR News show\non Nebula. That is true. Too long; didn't read... There's a lot of good\noriginal content on Nebula. I think when you add \nas a Jet Lag viewer  if you add together\nthe fact that you can get all of the Jet Lag stuff\nthat we mentioned  plus all these Originals \nplus you're actually helping support us\nand helping fund the show? It's a pretty good deal. But Sam  it costs too much money! What if I could offer you 40% off an annual subscription? Then it would cost\nthe right amount of money. Yeah. Well  Ben  I think you should... fire up your old internet browser and go to\nwww.nebula.tv/jetlag. And press the enter button. Woah! I got 40% off. And that means that\nit's only $36 a year? $36 a year. That's only $9 a quarter. Wow.\nWow. Or— Or— I can't do that math. How many is that a day? It's like free a day. It's like 10 cents a day. If you round to the closest dollar \nit's $0 a day. Yeah. It's like how Tic Tacs\ndon't have any calories. Exactly. Nebula is free. We can't say that.\nNot actually. Wait  are you saying that\nTic Tacs do have calories? Yes.\nYeah. Of course.\nThey just round them down  yeah. They get rounded down\nwith the sugar and stuff. Are you having full meals of Tic Tacs?\nUh-oh. That's not good. Ugh  okay  sorry. Maybe that's why you keep\nhaving cavities. No  it's him. I'm the one with the cavities.\nIt's him. Which is why I abolish the dentist!\n'Cause he doesn't believe in the dentist. Because I abolish the dentist\non Abolish Everything!  exclusive to Nebula. Whole 'nother show\nthat we haven't talked about. But anyway  go to\nnebula.tv/jetlag. Sign up. I gotta call my doctor. Okay.\n(cracks up)"

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nback to episode five of our race to claim\nthe most countries in Europe. Right now it's\nthe morning of day four and the score is 7-7. Ben and Adam finished yesterday at Leonardo da Vinci\nInternational Airport in Rome after locking down\nItaly and the Vatican. Their plan today is to fly\nfirst thing to Amsterdam in an attempt to\nsteal the Netherlands. But Tom and I are\ncautiously optimistic. Even though the Netherlands\nis vulnerable because we failed to\nlock it on day one  we think that the\nNetherlands challenge is nearly impossible  meaning that Ben and Adam\nmight fly all the way there and get nothing\nif they fail the challenge too. But whether or not they succeed \nTom and I need to move quickly. We scooped up Denmark\nand Sweden last night  but we haven't locked\neither country yet. With Ben and Adam\nmaking their way north  we'll need to do everything\nwe can to lock down at least one of our\nScandinavian territories. Otherwise  we'll set\nBen and Adam up for a devastatingly\neasy back-to-back steal. So with all that on the line \nlet's go ahead and see what the Sweden challenge\nhas in store. Oh  let's hope\nthis is good  Tom. The time is 7:33. Go. Find Amy a \"Jungelslog\". Find Amy a DJUNGELSKOG. This is actually perfect.\nI desperately need a  DJUNGELSKOG. Could you help me out? Go to IKEA\nand find a  DJUNGELSKOG within 25 minutes of\nentering the store. You may not look up\nwhat a  DJUNGELSKOG is  nor may you ask for\nhelp from anyone else. You don't have to buy it  just text me a pic of\nyou and the  DJUNGELSKOG so I know it's in stock.\nThanks! You don't have to buy it. Just text me a pic of\nyou and the  DJUNGELSKOG  so I know it's in stock. Thanks.\nOh  IKEA's— I don't know if\nIKEA's gonna be open. Oh  it might be\ntoo early for IKEA. IKEA Malmö.\nIKEA Malmö. Doesn't open until 10.\nOh  that's brutal! Are there any other IKEAs? 10 am. I think they're\nall gonna be 10. I mean  they're not\nthe kind of things that are open early. That is really not good  but... That's not good because\nthat's a very easy challenge for someone who comes\nhere to steal the country. If you can find a  \"Junkelsvagiv\". IKEAs are pretty big. Yeah  they are. That's true. It's a time consuming one. 'Cause getting to\nIKEAs on public transit Yes.\nwill take a little bit 'cause they're never\nin city centers. And then you're gonna have\nto search the entire IKEA. Not to say  I don't think\nit's ultimately that difficult  but I think it is time consuming. It's a time was— yes \nbut that doesn't matter if they're stealing Sweden.\nNo  but yeah. First impression \nit's not worth waiting two and a half hours for that. No  and I hate that! We keep having lousy luck\nwith challenges  Sam. Look  here's\nwhat we should do now. We should head to Denmark.\nDo that challenge. Just accept and\nthrow this one away? Well that's \nI guess that's the thing. We can't come back. No  we can't.\nUgh. We can only have one\nchallenge open at a time. As soon as we open\nthe Danish challenge  we have to call them and let them know that\nSweden is available. It's really not great \nbut I think... I think we've gotta\noperate on the theory of a single country is\nnot that attractive. It's a two-country pair\nthat's attractive. Yeah  and we've already\nlost one of that pair. Yes. So  I mean  that means\nwe have to lock Denmark. Yeah. And in fact  Benjamin  here is our gate. We've made it. We will board this plane\nto Amsterdam. Literally no\nfreaking problem at all. Oh  I hate this  Sam!\nI hate this. Let's at least go one or two blocks\ninto the city there. So it looks like we got\nmeaningfully away from the station. So they look at\nthe tracker and go  \"Okay  they didn't just...\"\nYeah. Okay  and should we... I think maybe we should be\nout of breath or something. Yes  yes  absolutely. This is— these are not the circumstances\nthat I would want. No. But I think that a path\nto victory at this point is that they go to\nthe Netherlands  fail. Then they come to Sweden...\nAnd fail. 'Cause again  it's\nnot the easiest challenge. No  it's not.\nEven once you get to an IKEA. No. Alright. Uh-oh  we are getting\na call from Sam. This can't be good. Hello  Sam and Tom. Hi. Uhh... I think they're\nmessing with us. Stop looking sad.\nAre you tricking us? I think they're\nmessing with us. Unfortunately not. Whoa.\nSweden challenge failed. Sweden is vulnerable. Well  well  gentlemen \nI'm sorry about that. I mean  I'm thrilled about it \nbut I am sorry. I hope that you sort of\ncontinue to fail throughout the day  but I'll continue to\nfeel sorry about it. Okay  we gotta go  bye. Okay.\nOkay  well  let's hope... Let's hope that's\nenough misinformation to get 'em to come here\nwhen they're in a rush. Let's hope that's\nenough misinformation for them to think that this is\na luck-based  quick challenge that requires physical effort\nand not time. Let's go get over\nthe Øresund Bridge. Yeah. And we're getting\non the freaking plane. Because we're unstoppable\nand we can't be stopped. This is very  very interesting. This is very  very  very\ninteresting because— For two boys exactly like us  this is one of the\nmost interesting things that you could hear. Because we are\nheading directly up there. Yes. It is very easy for us\nto go to Sweden. And I would say that\nalmost certainly we should. We're doubling down\non the risk. Well  we'll see how this goes. We'll see what\nhappens in Amsterdam. Here.\nOh man. Allow me to\npresent to you a theory. They seemingly\nstarted the challenge right when the day started.\nYes. That is the worst time\nto start a challenge. It's true. Because if the challenge\nis time limited  and it requires getting materials \noftentimes everything is closed. So I think that\nthere is a possibility we would've a better chance\nat the challenge if going there midday.\nThat is probably— Just to throw that out.\nThat is probably true. I also think that... it could have been\njust impossible to do for a really long time \nand they forfeited it. Yeah.\nSo that they could keep moving. That's true.\nI just don't know. They were at a... like basilica when they called us. I don't know if—\nI don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. We'll see what\nthey do in Denmark. 'Cause also they could\nfail the Denmark one. Yeah. Agh  let's get to Denmark. Oh  I gotta hope that the\nDenmark challenge is doable. Oh yeah.\nAnd not too luck-based. Hey  we can look up\nwhat a  \"Dunkel-skyog\" is now. Yeah  and maybe\nhow difficult it was. Yeah. Oh  well let's get on the train\nand we'll do that. I bet it's one\nof the plush toys. Yeah  yeah  very possible. I bet it's the plush bear. I bet you right now\nthat is the plush toy bear. Oh god. Is it the plush toy bear? Yeah  you're right.\n(sighs loudly) That might be easy to guess.\nYeah. I just took our odds of\ngetting to the challenge to 100%  didn't I \nif we waited until 10 am? I don't know\nwhere I dredged that from in the depths of my memory.\nWell... But as soon as\nthe pressure was off  my brain went  plush toy bear\nis called \"Dunkle-skyog\". Hopefully they're\nnot as familiar with IKEA plushes.\nOhhh! I'm infuriated I did not realise\nabout the bear earlier. Oh  that sucks! I'm not gonna lie  Tom.\nThat does suck. We can take here. Did we just make the wrong call? Well... As soon as I thought of bear  I'm like  did we make\nthe wrong call? Yeah  my thoughts\nwould've been different if... we thought we knew \nwe had a strong theory  what the object was.\nYeah. Because I was thinking\nit would just be any random thing. I remember  Ben wrote \nI'm pretty sure it was Ben  he wrote in a joke about the IKEA...\ndolphin plushie or something? Yeah.\nIn an HAI video once. So I'm pretty sure that...\nYeah. Could have been Amy \nbut I'm pretty sure... he knows about the IKEA\nplushies and the... I think we're gonna\nlose Sweden  Sam. Well... that's Gate A71.\nYep. The flight to Amsterdam is boarding out of...\nYou wanna guess? Gate 71.\nA71. And the tracker... puts them at Gate A71.\nAlright. I don't hate this  I mean. I— That's true. Here's what I'll decide\nto like this  Tom. Okay. I don't think we have a good shot\nof catching up to them if we're each just incrementally claiming one more country. I think our best shot is that they waste\nall this time and budget going to somewhere and not successfully...\nstealing our country. I think that's a great way\nthat we can catch up. Yeah. The problem is we just left\nanother one vulnerable. Yeah  we did. Very vulnerable. Bridge.\nBridge. Welcome back to Denmark.\nYeah. Welcome to Copenhagen. –Haagen? I wish we could do more planning \nbut our flight options depend on how long this challenge takes \nand we have to take this challenge. 'Cause this is a situation\nwhere we need to give this challenge the time it takes.\nYeah. And the time it  you know \ntakes to give it its best shot. Yeah  absolutely. We can't... If we lose this country  Sam... We leave too much vulnerable. That's a nice tower thing. It is. That is Tivoli Gardens. That's the theme park. We may want to position ourself\nmore near a grocery store? I wonder if we want to\nhead to Helsinki after this. There's a 1 pm flight  which I think is likely\nto be good timing for us. Yeah. Alright  Tom. Alright.\nAre you sure we're in Denmark? We are definitely in Denmark. Okay. This has gotta be good. Oh.\nThis has gotta be good. This has gotta be good.\nShould I pull it? Pull it. (groans) Build a LEGO set blind.\nBuild a LEGO set blind. Build a LEGO set blind. Denmark  the birthplace of LEGOs. Build a LEGO set\nwith at least 200 pieces in under 45 minutes  and for some good fun \ndo it blindfolded! Only one team member\nmust be blindfolded. This team member must\ndo all the assembly. The other team member\nmay use the instructions to guide the blindfolded builder  but is not allowed to\nassemble the LEGOs himself. He may move and touch\nexactly one piece at a time as long as he doesn't\nput pieces together or take them apart. Okay.\nLEGO. Tough but doable  I think. Will there be a souvenir store\nin there that sells LEGOs or is there a souvenir\nstore out there? Do you wanna check\nthe station first? Yeah  alright. Alright  more than that \nlet's see if there's a LEGO store that opens at 9 am. 200 pieces. I mean  that's... LEGO Store\nCopenhagen opens at 10. 200 pieces in 45 minutes.\nThat's only... five pieces a minute. That's a piece\nevery 12 seconds  Sam. Yeah. But with LEGO sets \na lot of them are duplicates. Hopefully we could\nfind a kit... you know  one for young kids \nyou know. Cosmetics. And this is a big station  so I think...\nIt is. I feel like there should be\na tourist shop in here. Yeah.\nLemme look at my phone. Worst case  the LEGO Store\nopens at 10. Yeah  I don't\nwant to wait that long. I don't wanna wait that long. But if we do wait that long \nwe only spend 45 minutes on LEGO. We could still make\na 1 pm flight to Helsinki. Yes. I mean  I was hoping to be\nsomewhere in the station that sold tourist things.\nOh  the airport would def— Oh  it'd be past security though.\nI was gonna say. The airport would\ndefinitely have some  but— And we can't\ndo challenges there. It would  yeah. And it would be duty free \nand we can't do challenges there. Okay. No tourist shops\nat the station. All the department stores\nare on the main street a little way that way \npast Tivoli. But they all open at 10.\nMm. They all open at 10. It'd be real neat if\nthis country had Walmarts. Tom and I spent quite a while looking for anywhere\nthat would sell us LEGOs this early in the morning  but kept finding that nowhere\nwould be open until 10. Sure be neat if that was open.\nYeah. We thought we might have\na shot at the airport  so we headed there. But had no luck in\nthe pre-security area. No LEGO. Worth a try. No LEGO. You'd think that\nthe country of LEGOs would have more LEGOs  Tom. (sighs deeply) Haven't seen a single LEGO yet. There was a LEGO Store\npast security  but we figured that by the time\nwe could buy a ticket  get past security  get LEGOs  and get three miles\nfrom the airport  it would be around time for\nthe LEGO Store in town to open. So we headed back to Copenhagen. Welcome to Copenhagen  Tom. (chuckles sardonically) Yeah. Welcome to\nCopenhagen  Sam. I love Copenhagen. I just wish they had more\nearly morning stores. Yeah.\nSome of us are early risers. Mhm. Some of us wake up\nat 6 am and... Yeah. decide today's\nthe day to buy LEGO. Yeah.\nAnd build a LEGO. Yeah. And this country is just\nnot accommodating of that. We still have 14 minutes. Maybe we should stare\nthrough the window and see if we can\nidentify what we want. Yeah  alright. Okay. Is there a bigger LEGO shop within 12 minutes' walk?\nI don't know. I mean  this has\nan upstairs  I think. Yeah  it does. These would be complicated.\nI don't think we want the flowers. They have a mosaic maker. What if we make a custom set? It takes a photo. You just have to put\nthe pieces on the right place. If we get... This is cheeky.\nBlack out the screen? This is cheeky.\nGet an all-black mosaic. We just gotta make sure\nit's got 200 pieces. It will give us 200 tiny dots\nand a place to put 'em on. I think... surely! They're unlocking\nthe doors  alright. Let's see what we can get. Hello.\nHello. Okay  let's have a look.\nTouch to start. Oh  okay  we need to buy one. We should ask to figure out\nhow the mosaic thing works. Sign in. Do I need\na LEGO account for this? (chuckles softly)\nYes. How many pieces\ndo you think this is? Well  hang on \nlet's have a look. That is... 5  10  15  20  25. That is 50 by 50  so that's... Wait  that can't be right. That would be like... 50 by 50 would be\n2 500 pieces? I guess.\nYeah  that could be right. Yeah.\nThat would be... The alternative is  what's the easiest\n200-piece set in here? 200  just 200? Oh  it's gotta be at least 200. But ideally no more than 200. Can you check this one? This one looks maybe...\nYeah  okay. Relatively simple. 252. 252. I don't think— We're gonna waste time\nif we spend any longer  Sam. Do you wanna get this one? Oh.\nOh  this one looks pretty good. Oh  yeah. No  that's— That doesn't have\nworking suspension. 214.\nOh. Bit less.\nOh  let's try that one. Let's go – 214. I think this one's pretty good. Alright  let's do it. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nLet's go assemble some LEGO. Okay. Let's go do this challenge. Welcome to Amsterdam. Now  I had LEGO as a kid  but I've never  ever followed\nthe instructions  not once. How about you? I mean  I've built LEGO sets\nfollowing the instructions. Okay  so are you... I think you should\nread the instructions. You are better at methodical\nand not panicking than I am\nin situations like this. So  read the instructions \ngimme things to put together. Okay  let's find a nice\nquiet corner in the station. Alright. Tucked in behind\nthe model railway? Let's do it. Okay.\n45 minute timer is ready. Let me test my blindfolding. Okay  let me try to\norganize these somewhat. Yeah. Well that's an effective blindfold. When you lay it\nall out like that  Tom  it's a good number of...\nIt's a really good number. I don't like this at all.\n45 minutes. Alright  well... I can't see anything.\nLike  I can... (imitates punch) (giggles) You see that? You made a noise.\nOkay. So I can sort of\nsee vague lights above... I was testing whether\nyou would flinch when I... Did I? No  tried punching you.\nNo  you didn't. Alright  well \nI can't see a thing  so... I suppose this is\nas ready as we'll be  Tom. Alright  well you're\ngonna have to start a timer 'cause I can't use\nmy phone anymore. I'm a little nervous  Tom.\nYeah  so am I. I'm a little nervous.\nThis 45 minutes is gonna suck. Gotta stay calm.\nGotta be methodical. Yep.\nReady to start? Yep. And we are starting. Give me pieces.\nTell me what to do. Okay  first we're\ndoing the mini figure. I'm gonna hand you the legs.\nHere are the legs. Yes.\nHere's the body. Here's the head. Is that the\ncorrect way 'round? No  that is. Here's the head. Okay  mini figure  done. Alright  now I'm handing you\none piece of a dolphin. Okay. And this one's\ngonna be a little tricky 'cause it's non-traditional \nbut you need to slide this onto the face of the dolphin. It's kind of an articulating face. Rotate by 90 degrees \nin front of you. Like that?\nYep. Got it. Okay.\nDone. Alright  now go all the way\nto the bottom of the long piece. Got it.\nYep. Now put this on centered. Excellent instructions  Sam. Really excellent instructions.\nThank you. Alright  buddy. Let's get three miles\naway from this place. I think we really\nwant to be situated as centrally as we can. Yep  for sure. And then we can go ahead \nand open this guy. See  I'm so scared.\nI know. I mean  I don't know\nwhat it is that they failed. What's fun is that\nyou  the audience  you do know\nwhat this challenge is. Right  you know\nexactly what's going on. And you might have been\nscreaming at your screen for hours  \"Don't go to Amsterdam.\nThis challenge is too hard.\" But we don't know that. We simply don't know.\nWe can't hear you! Okay  now put this... Sorry  feel for the side. What?\nFeel  where your... Sorry  this is hard to describe.\nDown  down. Feel the middle.\nHere? Now feel for the side.\nHere? Yes. Now you're putting this\nat the bottom  one lane of bricks in. Here? Rotate 90 degrees.\nHere. One lane in.\nHere. At the bottom.\nGo down  go down  go down. There?\nYes  that's right. That is correct.\nYep. Okay.\nNow put this... On the other side just here?\nAway from you  up. Yep. One lane in. There.\nYep. Now you're replicating what\nwe just did on the left side. There?\nYes. Yeah?\nAnd here's the next piece. There? Yes.\nOkay. Okay. Such good instructions  Sam. Thank you.\nThank you  Tom. I will say... it's one of only two challenges\nthat have been failed. Most challenges have been\nsuccessfully completed. But guess how many\nchallenges we've completed? All of 'em. Okay  now towards you. This is going to the side.\nAll the way to the side. So  there?\nYeah... I think one up? Yes  that looks right.\nIt's a little bit tricky. Hold on  hold on \nhold on  hold on  hold on. There?\nYep. Right there  okay.\nYep. Same thing left side.\nSame thing left side. Yep.\nAlright  we're doing well  Tom. God  I hope the\ncamera's still rolling. Okay  now this piece is— Hold on  those feel uneven.\nOh yeah  sorry. The left one needs to\ngo one towards you. Oh  that was lucky. No  up  up  up. Sorry. Out kind of... No  no  on top of that\nkind of bit that you just did. Yep  that's right. Try to lock it down at the top. This  wait \nwhat the (bleep) just happened? Something just happened.\nOh  sorry. I missed a step.\nI missed a step. Okay  okay.\nI'm gonna take— I'm gonna be honest  Tom.\nWe need to move quickly. Yeah  I know.\nSo I'm just saying like... I know  I know  I'm... Okay.\nTrains. People brought\nballoons to greet us. Alright. Off to Amsterdam Centraal. Whew. Oh boy  I hope this goes well. Okay  that's...\nA little to the right. There you go. There you go. Now this is going on top\non the little nubs. There? One to the right. Ugh  sorry  the piece\nI just did was wrong. Rotate 90 degrees to the left. There.\nYes. Down  down  down. Up  up  up  up  up. Down a little bit.\nUp a little bit. Up  up  up  up  up.\nOne more. One more down towards you. Yep.\nThere  okay. Oh  sorry  no  one up. Left. One to the right.\nLike that? Yes. I can't see how that la— I can't see anything.\nI can't feel how that latches. I—\nThere. No. What?\nOne to the right. There.\nYep. Got it.\nAlright  now put the car down. Yep.\nWe're going to put... this on the top right. Yep. Actually  did I get\nthat right? Yep. And... (phone timer rings) Aaaggh! (sighs) We couldn't have done\nthat any faster  Sam. I  we... We could not have\ndone that any faster. We gave that our best shot. I mean  look. How close were we? It's not that much \nwhich I honestly wish it was more because then Ben and Adam\nwould have a harder time. That's not good  Tom.\nNo  it's not. That's not good.\nI'm not gonna lie. I'm not— that's not good.\nIt's not good. The short of finding a LEGO set that was just clunk \nclunk  clunk  clunk  we could not have\ndone that any faster. At least it's\nfar from a sure shot  because I do feel like... we assembled that\nas well as we could. Maybe Ben and Adam  you know  they've done\na lot of these together. Maybe they can figure out\nhow to communicate. They are  unsurprisingly \nin the Netherlands. We've gotta give 'em a call\nand then we've gotta get in a plane. Well  let's be\nsure not to show them Yeah— wall.\nwhat the thing is. Oh  they look happy.\nGentlemen. No  they don't look happy.\nIt is... Not gonna lie. We're not doing well.\nDenmark has not been locked. Oh my god.\nDenmark is vulnerable. Oh  boys! That is a—\nThat's tough news for you. Enjoy the Netherlands.\nWe gotta go. Bye. Bye. Oof. I feel like I was really\nexcited to gloat last time. That one \nyou feel a little bad. That one \nyou gotta feel a little bad. Oh  boys. I feel bad. In another way... I feel amazing.\nI feel really... In another sense.\nI feel really good. Okay  Tom. We don't have too long.\nNo. Are we going to Helsinki?\nI think we have to. I don't think we have\nany other options  Sam. I think it's their best option.\nAnd then... And then when\nwe get there  we decide... if we're booking on a flight onwards\nonce we get to the airport. But we can't book\na connecting flight because that means\nwe won't claim Finland. Yeah. We need a single\nticket to Finland. We can only hold\none ticket at a time. We go to Helsinki  Sam. We have nothing else!\nOkay. Well that flight leaves\nin an hour and 45. So we can make it.\nWe can do that. We can do that. We can do that. But we need to go quickly. Alright! Let's go quickly. This is really strange \nbut this is— We just had to try\nand complete this. If the kid would like a LEGO set \nyou are welcome to it. Thank you.\nThank you. Thank you. It's mostly assembled  but... It's mostly assembled. But you know what?\nShe's a parent. She's had to deal with\nbigger messes than that. Let's get to the train. At the very least  that's a\nreally difficult challenge. There's a chance\nthey lose Sweden. There's a very strong chance they lose this and waste\na lot of time doing it. Yeah  there's even\na chance they lose both and waste a ton of time\ndoing both. Yes. So  I mean—\nThere are two adults  now. I don't love that\nas our best shot  but... 11:30  can we make—\nWe can make 11:30. We can make that. Honestly  there's some\nweird version of the plot of the next couple days...\nWhere they follow us and fail. Where they foll— where\nthey fail the Netherlands  follow us here  fail both \nwaste a ton of time  and in that time we've caught up.\nIt'd be a weird plot. Here's the thing  it's still \ndespite all our grumbles  what's the score? 7–7.\n7–7. Knowing that\nJet Lag: The Game is scripted and the most improbable scenario\nalways happens  I think that they fail all three and that gets us in the lead\nand we win  Tom. I think the moral of the season\nis gonna be the downfall of hubris  Tom. They're gonna have hubris. Here... I will say though. Just because they\nfailed the challenges doesn't mean that we will\nsucceed at the challenges. Doesn't it?\nBut we're gonna. ♪ But we're gonna ♪ Alright.\nAlright. Please tell me\nthe flight hasn't sold out. Nope  it's available. Alright  how much? However many\n3 278 Danish kroner are. Alright. That's for both— Wait  for one or both of us?\nBoth. Okay  yeah  that's affordable.\nWe can do that. There's our train. What time is our flight? One. We can make that.\nIt'll be a bit of a rush  but security shouldn't be\ntoo bad this time of day. I imagine that there is one\nperfect LEGO set out there that would make that possible.\nProbably. But if there is \nwe didn't find it. Okay.\nAlright  Ben. Let's get out. Yes  let's get out of the train station.\nInto somewhere accessible. Yep. And then \nwe'll pull our challenge. And here we are. You can definitely\nset up a full shot. Okay.\nAlright. Welcome to Amsterdam. Beautiful Amsterdam. Let's find out what the\nNetherlands challenge is that Sam and Tom failed. You ready? Yeah. Build Jason his dream bouquet. Build Jason his dream bouquet. The Netherlands are\nknown for many things. It's not just bikes. Indeed  the Netherlands are\nthe flower shop of the world. So please assemble the bouquet\nof Jason from Not Just Bikes' dreams to his precise specifications. Complete and send Jason\na picture of your bouquet within 30 minutes \nor you fail this challenge. Your time starts\nthe next time you touch a flower. You may not do any research \nflower acquisition  or assembly until then. Okay  let's watch that video. Okay. Oh  it's Jason.\nWelkom in Nederland. Thanks for\nhelping me out here. Okay. I always wanted\na flower bouquet with at least six carnations\nSix carnations. of three different colors \nThree different colors. two orange gerberas \nTwo what? a Christmas Rose \nand an Alstroemeria. Christmas Rose?\nWhat the hell is a Christmas Rose? And all filled out\nwith some Mimosa. That was\nso many things  Jason. Oh  he had a lot of\nflowers that he wanted. That sounds hard as(bleep)\nThat sounds impossible. I've never— I've all  I've— The only one of those\nI've heard of is a carnation. And I guess I've heard of roses  but I don't know what\na Christmas Rose is. What's a Christmas Rose? I don't know\nthe answer to that. Okay. We are not allowed to do\nany research or anything. We gotta touch a flower  and... I think that scoping out Amsterdam\nwould be research. So I think we just have to\ntouch the next flower we see. I mean  look \n30 minutes  I bet— We're in Amsterdam!\nThere's got— There's— Theoretically there should\nbe no city in the world that you have a better chance\nof finding a bunch of flowers. Let's find a flower  I guess. Oh man  I can see\nwhy they failed this. Yep. Okay.\nOkay. So we gotta go touch a flower \nand then our 30 minutes can begin. Sam  I have news. The lads are in\nAmsterdam Centraal. Mhm.\nThey're at the main station. That is a logical place\nto pull a challenge. Yep. I have bad news \nwhich is that... there are a lot of florist shops within easy walking distance\nand running distance. Well  only some of those\nare actually that close to Centraal. Yeah. There's at least one  two \nthree  four they could rea— Yeah. If they really\nput the hammer down  and they run and they sprint and they desperately\ngo into florist shops... Mhm. To be honest  I thought there\nwould be even more than that. They get to roll the dice\na lot of times. They do. They do. And our guy\nin Maastricht said that maybe somewhere would\nhave it in Amsterdam. Yeah  it certainly is\na lot easier of a challenge in central Amsterdam\nthan Maastricht. Those are flowers. Those are definitely flowers. They're definitely real. Okay. Alright.\nAlright  you ready? I'm ready. Three  two  one  go. Okay  florists.\nAlright  let's look up florists. Let's start walking this way\nwhile we look. This place  Jemi  it's open. Okay  it's a\nseven minute walk. Let's move. You've got it? You've got— Yeah  I got it. You know where it is? Okay. I think there's no jaywalking\nin this country  so... No  (bleep)  no.\nWe actually need to cross here. Oh  come on! Aaaaahhh... Come on  come on \ncome on  come on. Okay.\nHere we go. We have unwittingly\nand unwillingly laid a trap for them. It's not a good trap. It's really not a good trap. But at least they\nare failable challenges. If luck decides to\nswing on our side. If no one in Amsterdam has Christmas Roses in January. Ohh. I guess they're about\nto find out. Oh! Look! Maybe these are just common\nflowers in the Netherlands. I certainly hope so. Oh yeah  okay  it's right here. Here? Okay. Alright. Let's see what they got. Hi.\nHello. We are doing... a scavenger hunt\nand we need to get these flowers. I might have spelled\nsome of them wrong. I only have the... the two Gerberas.\nOnly those? Yeah.\nOkay  can I have— Can we get those please?\nYeah. You have no carnations?\nYes. Okay  we need six carnations \nthree different colors. Well  I've got two colors. Okay  then we'll take\ntwo of each  please. Two of each?\nYes  please. Do you have any mimosas?\nNo. Do you have\na Christmas Rose? Uhh  no. No. Do you have— Christmas is...\nYes. Yeah.\nTwo weeks ago. Any ideas where\nwe could find those? Nearest flower shop\nis closed until Monday. You can try the new market. We're the only florist\nin the neighborhood. Okay  okay  thank you. Just need to start to\nfigure out the back— How much time do we have left?\nWe have 20 minutes left. Thank you.\nOkay  thank you. Okay. Okay  so the nearest one... Is Flower Design.\nthat's open is Flower Design. But the question is \ndoes that look like it's gonna have more flowers than\nFlorist 't Lievertje? I think we're—\nHere's what I think. We should go... There's three all next\nto each other up there. So we should go this way.\nOkay  you know the way? Yep. We really gotta move. Tom  do you want to know\nwhat the weather's like in Helsinki? What's the weather\nlike in Helsinki? Snow! Is there any risk\nof us getting snowed in? No. Oh  welcome back to\nCopenhagen Airport  Sam. I love Copenhagen Airport. There are worse airports. Alright  \"låts gätes\". I don't know the\nSwedish for \"let's go\". This airport is like... an eight outta ten. Yeah. Oh  it's\na solid airport. I just— You know what'd make\nit a nine outta ten? A LEGO Store?\nA pre-security LEGO Store. Yeah.\nEvery— Oh  oh. Sam  Sam. We're gonna get through security  and there's gonna be a LEGO Store\njust taunting us. I— We cannot look\nin that LEGO Store because it will— we— I just know it'll have an\neasy 200 piece puzzle in it. Yeah  I bet it will have a 200-piece block.\nYep. Helsinki  go to terminal two. 13:00 to Helsinki  right? Yeah.\nTerminal two. What are they up to\non the tracker  Tom? Heh. Well  they're still... I don't know if it's running  but I can see Adam's dot\nmoving down the street. So they haven't\nfound all the things yet. At speed. We're definitely gonna make it\nto the second florist  okay? Yeah. And there's two other ones\nright next to them. Maybe there's... Because a Christmas Rose  he was like \n\"Well  it's not Christmas.\" Well  I live in enormous fear\nthat the Christmas Rose is because we were supposed to\nbe playing this in December. Oh (bleep)  yeah. Tom.\nGood news. The lads are still on the move. Tom  look at this.\nStill moving fast. Bad news.\nTom. We found the LEGO shop.\nTom  look at this one. This one would've been doable. And that one\nwould've been doable. Aw no. Awwh. Yeah.\nThat's annoying. That's annoying. Oh  that's not good. It's not good. Hopefully they're not... they don't think to\ngo to the bigger one. I hope they're\npanicking about florists. I think they're\nat this florist  apostrophe-T \"Leeverche\".\nOh good  yeah  okay. Yep. That's almost certainly not how\nyou pronounce that  but yeah. But it does  it looks like  I don't know if that's\nactually a florist that... Oh  I guess...\nIt's a little florist stand. Yeah  but that's selling... That's not flowers. Those are seeds.\nOh  no  that's selling seeds. Huh. That's a plant shop \nnot a florist. Maybe  yeah. Oh  they do not have a lot. That's very limited. Let's take a look here.\nLet's just ask this lady. Hello. We're doing a scavenger hunt. We need to get... two carnations \na Christmas rose  and mimosa. I don't have\nthe Christmas Rose. None of those?\nDo you have— no mimosa? No.\nNo Christmas Rose? Maybe they have\nit at the flower market. Okay.\nMaybe. Okay  which way? Okay. She says to go to\nthe end of the street. Okay. Yeah  there's another one\nright down there. Okay. Maybe this place\nwill have what we need. Oh  man. They're moving. They're moving. They're not finding\nthe seasonal things. They are moving so fast! Oh  this— This is— oh  this— I can't.\nOh  they're moving more now. They've left that shop.\nThey've realised it's seeds. Okay  they're still on...\nYeah. Okay  where\nare they going next? There are a bunch\nof florists there  so they're gonna have\na lot of options. They can't have\nthat much time left. No  I don't think so. We didn't clock when\nthey started it  but... Alright.\nWe still got 11 minutes  Ben. It should be right\naround here  right? Is it that across the street? Oh  the flower market. Is that it? Oh  that is a flower market. That is several. Yeah  that... I mean \nif they can make it there... If they can make\nit there in time... That will have probably a shot. Let's hurry.\nYeah  yeah  yeah  yeah. Let's hurry. Oh  they have\nso many flowers there! Okay. Go quick  go quick. Oh  come on. Come on  baby. Oh  they've gotta have 'em here.\nOkay  okay  okay  okay. We need to find somebody. You work on finding somebody.\nI'm gonna look. They have— Those are Gerbera. Excuse me. Do you have mimosa? No? Do you have\nChristmas Roses? Hi  do you have\na Christmas Rose? Any Christmas Rose? No.\nNo? Okay. You have carn— We are\ndone with Christmas. Okay  okay. No  no  okay  next one. No  this isn't really flowers. This is like... Flower themed stuff. These are bulbs. Yeah  let's just keep looking maybe. Everybody  when we ask them\nfor a Christmas Rose  goes  \"No  we are done with Christmas.\nYou dummies.\" Those are just seeds. These are all seeds. Do Christmas Roses\nhave any other name? They do. Six minutes. They're Helleborus  black hellebore. I mean  there's more. Yeah  these are all  yeah.\nIt's all flower themed stuff. It's like mocking us. How are they doing? So they're in an area\nthat's called \"the Flower Market\". Okay.\nAs in like... the address that shows\n\"Flower Market\". Okay.\nSo... But they're still moving? They're still\nmoving down this line. So they haven't found\nit yet  I don't think. Okay. Are they just yelling \n\"Has anyone got Christmas Rose?\" Yeah  Adam would\ntotally do that. To vendor after\nvendor after vendor? Yeah  that sounds\nexactly right. Are they making\na scene in Amsterdam? That's their specialty. Hi  do you have\nany Christmas Roses? No.\nDo you have Mimosa? No  okay. This is crazy. This is all... It's all flower themed. But no one has\na Christmas Rose! This— Wait  oh  this is plants.\nThis place has some... Okay  this has some stuff \nbut there's nobody here. Look for labels.\nWell... Helleborus.\nHelleborus? That's Christmas Rose. Yeah.\nOkay  okay  okay  okay. So let's see if they\nhave the other stuff. Christmas Rose there. So then we just need mimosa\nand two more carnations. Why is there nobody here?\nWhy is there nobody here? Okay. Oh  hi.\nHi. Do you have mimosa? No  we don't have—\nNo  okay. Do you have carnations?\nNo. No  okay.\nAnything else? No  no.\nNo  that's okay. Okay. Okay  if we could find\nmimosa and carnations somewhere else—\nThose are so much more common. we could bring it back there. But the first place\ndidn't have those? Carnation is easy.\nThe mimosa is the problem. One minute  20 seconds. I mean... Yeah  I think that's it. No. These are all dried. (phone timer pings)\nThat's it. That's it. That's it. Man! Okay. Okay. Incoming call.\nWhat do you think it is  Tom? Moment of truth.\nLet's see if they got a bouquet. Lads. Yeah  they... Christmas Roses are outta\nseason  it turns out. Yeah. We found one though.\nWe learned that  actually. Yeah  we learned that\nthe hard way. Yeah. So  I assume you're\nnot just baiting us. No  we're not\nmessing with you. That'd be too much.\nYou guys have had a hard day. We have not\nstolen the Netherlands. That's tough. That's tough. That's your first\nchallenge failure  isn't it? It is.\nYeah. Sorry  gents. That's tough. Bye.\nThere we go. That's what we needed.\nIt's still 7-7. (chuckles) You know what'd be nice? They fly here  they do\nthe Sweden challenge first. And they pull\nthe Sweden challenge at about the same time we did. Oh yeah. Because I feel like\nif you come here  the intuitive thing is \noh  you're in Denmark. Do Denmark first.\nYeah. And then head over\nto Malmö for the morning. And if you get there\nfirst thing in the morning  you're not gonna be able to\ndo it for a couple of hours. Yeah.\nSo here's the thing. It's 12:30.\nYeah. It's halfway\nthrough the game day. And they have made zero progress. That's true. They've made\nnegative progress  Tom. 'Cause they've spent flight budget. It's still 7–7. I still kind of think  I hope they come here \nbecause... It's the obvious play for them. There's a lot of flights\nto Copenhagen. There's a lot of flights\nout of Copenhagen. I still think\nit's our best shot. And they have... if they boss both challenges \nthey go up by two  we go down by two. But I think simultaneously them wasting the time\nof coming here... Yeah.\nand failing them is our best shot of\ngetting in the lead. Alright  well we gotta\nget back to the airport 'cause there is still time for us to challenge Denmark That sucks.\nand Sweden today  okay? I mean  here's what\nI'll say this really proves. The failed challenges...\nAre hard. Are hard.\nThat's why they were failed. Yep.\nLet's just get to the airport. I think that we need\nto go to Copenhagen. Yeah. Oh  Ben! I can't believe you\nfound a Christmas Rose. (laughs) I know! That was the one I thought\nwe were never gonna find. How you feeling  Adam? Really bummed out. Yeah.\n'Cause here's the thing. They've failed challenges... but they haven't failed a steal. If you fail to challenge\nin a country you claim  you might keep it \nas we just saw. They failed the\nNetherlands challenge. Actually  that has ended up\nto be great for them because they still\nget the Netherlands and we wasted\nhalf a day coming here. Hopefully the same does not go\nfor Denmark and Sweden. We will see. We have to get\nat least one of them. Yeah. Oh  Ben  that's such a bummer! I look so sad\nwith my sad bouquet. I know.\nIt's like... It's tough to look sad\nwith a bouquet. I agree.\nBecause then it looks— One of the\nsaddest possible images. Then it looks like\nyou were scorned by a lover.\nA lover  yeah. And in a sense we were  but our lover... was Lady Luck. Okay  well  you know \ngame remains tied. Not for long. But you gotta imagine that\nthey are about to fly somewhere. Probably to Helsinki. Screwed that  shut up. I do like being in the...\nin Scandinavia. Jet Lag Scandinavia has\nbeen highly requested. But it's so nice in these countries.\nYeah. Maybe do it in summer. In fact  ideally \ndo it in the three weeks between snow season\nand mosquito season. These are flowers.\nLook  flowers. I don't even\nwant to know if they— No  I don't want—\nLet's not look  let's not look. It's gonna do psychic damage.\nDon't look. Do not look at those flowers.\nI have to ask. Excuse me. Do you have mimosas? Yep. Yep. They've got mimosas here. I think those are mimosas. I told you not to look. Let's go get you a cone of fries. Time is valuable at this point. Which does bring us\nto the other strategy that you've thought about. Just speedrunning. Just keep flying. Well...\nHow much budget do we have? I almost have it worked out. Almost $2 500 left.\nIt's pretty generous. For two more\ngame days after this. I mean  I think we could take\npretty much any flight we want with that. Mind you  so can they. So the question is  Sam... if we change strategy so that we are just\nbouncing between countries as fast as we can \nclock up every single one  we need to reach countries twice as fast as\nthey can claim them. I don't know how crazy that is. I don't either. There's an argument for\njust using the budget Because again  keep in mind.\nand bouncing. They don't need it. The precise order that we go... To steal the countries back  they have to go in\nthe precise order we go. But they can't\ntake the connections because they need to\nget out the airport. Right.\nDo the challenge  head back. And as we've seen  the flights\nonly happen every once in a while. Anyway.\nIt's a plan. Let's research more. Oh  that is pretty. We got consolation fries. Mm  that's a fun phrase. Consolation fries? Oh  it's like\nconsolation prize. Oh my god  okay.\nWe invented a new thing. Consolation fries. They look— I guess they— I already ate mine \nbut they were really good. They're not the\nmost beautiful object  but they do taste good. Look  Ben. This has been an enormous setback. But we got two more shots.\nTwo more shots. And then we'll be okay. Off to the airport  then. Let's go. We got some countries to steal. I got the moving one.\nMine doesn't work. Oh  the legs are starting to... Starting to feel it?\nYeah. Yeah. Okay. Seems like security\nis quick once again. Okay  well  Sam's tracker\nactually just got pinged right over the central\nBaltic Sea there  so... It would appear that\nhe and Tom are in fact going to Helsinki. Yeah  I mean \nthat's what we expected. My hope is  my deep hope is that they... will only get to Helsinki and then they'll have some dead time\nat the end of the day that they can't use\nfor anything helpful. I think that that may be  in fact exactly what\nis about to happen. That's the hope. We'll see. Meanwhile  all they\ncan do is sit by and watch as we snatch up\ntwo of their countries. God  I hope we snatch up\ntwo of their countries. At least one of their countries.\nYeah. We need at least one of 'em.\nWe gotta get one of those two. We gotta get Denmark or Sweden. Oh boy. It looks like the lads\nare at gate B17. That puts them on\nthe 2:55 to Copenhagen. Okay.\nThat's flight 548. That gets them in at... 4:15 local. Either way  they can't achieve\neither of those challenges before... 11 local tomorrow? Well  they can't\ncomplete them  yeah. Yeah. They'd have enough\ntime to get anywhere. They could get to either\nMalmö or here  but... Yeah.\nActually  they couldn't— I don't think they\ncould get to Malmö and all the way to IKEA. No  they couldn't. That would be funny. Oh. That would be funny. But if they pull it off  it's worth effectively\ntwo countries to them. Yes  but let's just say\nit wastes a lot. It would still be funny  yes.\nIt wastes a lot of their time. Yeah  it definitely is\na lot better for them if they go into Copenhagen first.\nYeah. Alright. Off to Copenhagen. So I think that we are\ngonna go straight to Malmö. Yeah  because\nour leading theory as to why they failed the\nSweden challenge so early is that it was\nso early in the morning  and whatever it was\nthey needed to do  they couldn't do\n'cause it was closed. Yeah  I mean  that's\nall we have to go off. All we know is that\nthey did it first thing. And so we figure probably best to not\ntry it first thing. The last thing you should do\nis exactly what they did. Yeah. Okay  here we go. Snow on the ground  Sam. Oh wow  that is\nnot much visibility. No  I'm surpris— Honestly? The camera can't focus.\nI'm surprised we... Oh  that is  wow. The camera is\nslightly out of focus  but that's also just... a lot of fog. This one I feel like\ndefinitely deserves lasers. Yeah. Sent. I think I need to\nremind 'em of the score. Yeah  yeah  you do. Okay  well... Well  we're on\nour plane to Copenhagen. Just before we were\nabout to take off... they have claimed Finland. Which does\nPuts them in the lead. put them in the lead. Look  all we have to do\nis focus on stealing Sweden and Denmark.\nYeah. If we can steal\nSweden and Denmark  it would put us in a\nreally good position. If we fail both of them  I would say it would put us\nin kind of a horrible position. Then we are in\na lot of trouble. But that'll— That won't happen. Score's 8–7.\nWe're winning. That is—\nStop the count  Tom. That is 15 countries.\nStop the count. Welcome to Helsinki  Sam. Cool. It is properly snowing. It is properly snowing. You know what the Finnish word\nfor airport or airfield is? Flughafen? No  no.\nThat's German. Lentokenttä. Okay  that's a fun fact. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah  it is. Should we... find the train? Yeah  I think\nthe only option here. We've got  there's no... There's no flight we can take\nthat gets us anywhere with good onward\nconnections for the game. Yeah. We can't reasonably get\nto Riga or Vilnius or Tallinn or anywhere tonight. And I think... I mean  we can\nget to some of 'em. There just isn't anywhere\nto go from there. And I think\nwe've decided that... the ferry is not as efficient\nas we maybe originally thought. No  because you've\ngotta check in early. Yeah.\nAnd then... And then it's two hours. It's just as\nslow as the flight. And it takes you  you know \nout into not downtown. Yeah. So let's try and lock Finland. Yeah. And then research where\nwe want to go to tomorrow. Any guesses what\nthe Finnish challenge is? Surely we have to\nFinnish something  right? Oh yeah. Moomins. Okay  yeah.\nI could see Moomins. We've already had a challenge\ninvolving a cute teddy bear. I think we're gonna\nhave to finish eating a Moomin. Well  let's get\ntickets into town. Okay. This is a long ass escalator. It's a long ass\npair of escalators  Sam. I've been down here before. This is so peaceful. Why is it so deep? Give us some tunnel facts  Tom. Gimme some what? Gimme some tunnel facts.\nTunnel facts? Yeah. Why is this so deep? I dunno. I believe it's... they're definitely taxiing.\nOkay. Assuming they're\non this flight. If anyone was thinking \noh  you know  sunset. Must be near the\nend of the game day. It's 4 pm Finnish time.\nIt is 3 pm Central European Time. There are still two and a half hours\nleft in this game day. Let's lock Finland  Sam.\nLet's do it. Alright. Helsinki  Sam. A light dusting\nof cold sleet... I think is the weather. It's lovely here.\nHow you feeling? Amazing. I love Helsinki. I've been here a few times. Alright.\nI love Finland. Big Scandinavia fan. One of the best areas\nof the world. Especially 'cause\nI blend in so well. (cackles) The problem here is that\nwhen I talk to people  sometimes even when\nI respond in English  they'll still respond in\nFinnish or Swedish Yep.\nor whatever. Because I so look the part. It's crazy to think that\nuntil a couple years ago  you could take... I think it was a three or four hour  high-ish speed train from here all the way to St. Petersburg. Wow! And that was only\na couple years ago. Yeah. When they left\nfrom this station. Yep. Very different world now. I think this train station\nis awesome. This is a good train station.\nI've been here before. Big fan.\nYeah. Simple  but cool. Pull it  Sam. Alright. Win level one of Angry Birds.\nWin level one of Angry Birds. Win level one of Angry Birds. Did you know Angry Birds\nis from Finland? In this challenge \nyou must construct and pass the first level of Angry Birds IRL. That means you must create/acquire\nbirds  a slingshot  a pig  and the 14-block structure\nthe pig is in. You must knock the pig\nto the ground/floor by firing each of your three birds\nat it/the structure. If you do not do it after firing\nall three birds  you fail. You get one attempt \nbut may practice. I think this is one that's good to take our time on actually  so...\nYes. We don't have to knock\nall the blocks down. Just the pig. That's doable  okay.\nOkay. I reckon we should look\nfor the closest hardware store. Yeah  agreed  let's do that. Because I think\nthat's gonna have the highest likelihood\nof the blocks. And I think the blocks\nwe want to be pretty blocky. 'Cause to be able to\nbuild this structure... Yeah  it needs to\nbe able to support a pig. Look for a toy store as well. Yeah  a toy store\ncould be good. Lot of lovely lights. So it looks like they should\nbe landing any minute now. Alright. What we can hope for\nin terms of logic is that they knew that we did\nthe Malmö one pretty quick  whereas it took us a while\nto do the Copenhagen one. So they might figure \n\"Oh  that's one that we can complete by the end of the day.\nGreat  let's go over there.\" And then they get there and they find they\ncan't get to an IKEA before the end of the game day. And they can't\ngo back to Denmark without losing the challenge.\nYeah. Yeah. So then they're\nstuck there for... three hours of game day.\nYeah. And then they have to go back\nand do the time waster in Denmark. Oh  here's hoping  Sam.\nHere's hoping. All the stars are\ngoing to align  Tom. (laughs) Welcome to... Denmark. I already forgot where we are. Alright  let's get our bags\nso we can get off the plane early. Yep. Okay  we have four minutes. When's the next train? Well  there's\none in 15 minutes. My worry is if we\nhave to take that one  what if we don't have\ntime for the challenge? Three minutes.\nWe gotta go to the Tog. Ooh  yeah  okay. \"Hesing-board\" C.\nOr no  that's flights. That's flights. Sorry  sorry. This is track one. I know  but I can't figure out\nwhat track this is on. It says Malmö.\nMalmö? Okay  great.\nLet's assume it's this. The 16:14  track one? Perfect. Alright  nice work. We'll have plenty of time\nto do the challenge. Yeah. And they failed\nit in just 15  so... Right. We'll have\nabout 50 minutes if we go to Central \nwhich we probably should. How much time\ndo we buy ourselves if we didn't? About 10 minutes. It's probably not worth it. Let's go to Malmö Central. Once again. Audience  is this—\nYou know! Is the Sweden challenge\ntoo hard? We don't know. Maybe. Or maybe they messed it up\nfor some stupid reason. I think we'll find out soon. We need this one. Yep. What's it gonna be? I'm just really hoping that... They just biffed it. They just biffed it super hard.\nYeah. Alright. Clas Ohlson. We—\n(gasps in fright) Sam!\nWhat? Sam  they're in Malmö! They've gone to Sweden.\nOh. Oh  Ben  Adam. Oh! No  hold on  hold on  hold on. They still have how long\nleft in the game day? They've got less than an hour. They won't make it\nall the way to IKEA. Are you sure? Okay  let's just get up here. Let's just see\nwhat the deal is. All we can do is\nsee what the deal is. Okay.\nHej. Welcome to Sweden. This country has suffered greatly\nover the last 24 hours under the iron fist of Sam and Tom Scott.\nBut we are about... to put an end to that\nwith a steal. Okay.\nAre you ready? Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah. Find Amy a DJUNGELSKOG. Find Amy a DJUNGELSKOG.\nThis is actually perfect. I desperately need a DJUNGELSKOG.\nCould you help me out? Go to IKEA and\nfind a DJUNGELSKOG within 25 minutes of\nentering the store. You may not look up\nwhat a DJUNGELSKOG is  nor may you ask for\nhelp from anyone else. You don't have to buy it. Just text me a pic of\nyou and the DJUNGELSKOG so I know it's in stock.\nThanks! Okay  but IKEA won't be\nopen tomorrow morning  which means we need to\nget there really fast. Take a look.\nThat must be why they failed. Please  please tell me that IKEA's easy to get to. (bleep bleep) It's gonna take\n28 minutes to get there. It's back where we were before. We can get there. Okay  let's hurry. There's one in two minutes. What platform? It's hard to tell. It's to... Pågatågen. Track 1B  1B. We need to get to 1B.\nHow do we do that? Uh-oh. That's not good. When does the train leave? In one minute.\nOkay. Sorry  in two minutes. Okay  let's see\nif we can get that. Better than one.\nSorry. 1A  1A. 1A  over here  over here \nover here  over here. Amy  we're gonna get\nyou that \"Jungle-skok\" or whatever it's called. What is that? That doesn't seem right. Malmö. Okay. 1B. (bleep)  it was 1B. Can we get to 1B? 1B? Go  go to 1B! Go to 1B! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Hey there  little boy. Did you know that the\nseason finale of Jet Lag: The Game is up right now on Nebula? The season finale  you could\nfind out who wins right now. Tall  tall man  is that true? Is that true that the\nseason finale is up right now? Because I've never heard\nof such a thing. It is true. I'm so tall because the\nseason finale is so big  right? And so this reflects that. And also  you can trust me\non account of how tall I am. The season finale is up\nright now on Nebula  little boy. Is there anything else\ngood on Nebula? I bet not. I bet that there actually is\nall kinds of good stuff  like the Layover podcast  where we recap every episode\nof Jet Lag: The Game but also stuff like\nAbolish Everything!  a Nebula Original comedy\ndebate show that we're producing  and The Getaway \na show that we made where it's like The Traitors  but everybody's a traitor\nand they don't realize that. And also original movies\nlike Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend and Identiteaze \nbut the point is that the finale of\nJet Lag: The Game is up right now on Nebula. I'm bouncing up and down.\nI'm so excited. It's up right now on Nebula. Whoa! Did your stomach\njust say that? I know how to do ventriloquism! Sometimes it sounds like stuff is\ncoming from a different... Why did you do that though?\nfrom a different... Sometimes it's a little fun \nbut you know what's especially fun? Watching the season finale\nup now on Nebula. Well... do you have\na good deal for me  tall  tall man? I bet not. I do have a great deal\nfor you  little boy which is that you could use\nthe code nebula.tv/jetlag. And then  a subscription will\nonly cost you $36 a year. Again  that's for\nthe whole year  $36. That's only... $9 a quarter. So that's a very good deal.\nHoly... Holy moly. I only have $36 to my name \n'cause I'm such a little boy  but I am going to spend it\nall on Nebula. And I'm going to use\ncode JETLAG 'cause I'm such\na good little boy. Thank you  tall  tall man \nfor all of this information. Bye. Why did you do that\nwith your stomach again? Oh my god  do you have\nanother arm?"

        "transcript": "Hello and\nwelcome to episode six of our race to claim\nthe most countries in Europe. Right now  our opponents \nBen and Adam  have seven countries: France  Switzerland \nLiechtenstein  Germany  Austria  Italy \nand the Vatican City. My partner  Tom and I are in the lead\nwith eight countries: Belgium  the Netherlands \nHungary  Slovakia  Czechia  Denmark \nSweden  and Finland  which we're about to try to lock by recreating the first level\nof Angry Birds. While we are in the lead \nwe're feeling pretty nervous because we failed our attempts\nto lock Denmark and Sweden  meaning they're vulnerable\nto being stolen by Ben and Adam  which is exactly what Ben and Adam\nare trying to do right now. They just arrived in Malmö  Sweden\nand opened the Sweden challenge to buy a DJUNGELSKOG at IKEA  but without looking up\nwhat a DJUNGELSKOG is. Tom and I thought this was great because we believed Ben and Adam\ndidn't have enough time left before the rest period\nstarts at 5:30 to get to IKEA and search. But Ben and Adam\nmanaged to find a train that would get them there. And right now \nthey're running for it. 1A  over here  over here \nover here  over here. Amy  we're gonna get\nyou that \"junkle-skok\" or whatever it's called. What is that? That doesn't seem right. Malmö. Okay. 1B. (bleep)  it was 1B. Can we get to 1B? 1B? Go  go to 1B! Go to 1B! Hell yeah. (exhales loudly) So this is good\nbecause we'll get there... with exactly 25 minutes\nleft in the day. Great.\nSo we'll be able to do— We'll have the full time. How the hell will\nwe find a DJUNGELSKOG? (sighs) I don't know. They've got...\nless than an hour. They won't make it\nall the way to IKEA. Are you sure? Well  the fact that they\nhave to get all the way to IKEA and then they have to spend\n25 minutes searching. Yeah  but if they\nknow what it is... Just out of interest... if you are at\nMalmö Central station  and by public transport \nyou want to get to IKEA Malmö  'cause IKEA's are not normally\ngood for public transit. No  they're out there. Eh  it's 23 minutes. Well... It's 23 minutes  Sam. It's possible they\ncould get there  but... I think it's unlikely\nthey can get there with a full 25 minutes left. I think it's looking good  Tom.\nHere's our shop. No  no  I'm not. If they've identified the bear  they can get a train...\nMaybe. They can peg it\nthrough that IKEA  grab the bear.\nMaybe. I think I might know\nwhat a DJUNGELSKOG is. You think you do? I feel like it might be a giant stuffed bear. I bet you right now\nthat is the plush toy bear. Oh god.\nIs it the plush toy bear? Yeah  you're right.\n(sighs) That might be easy to guess. Yeah. (sighs) They do have those at IKEA. I could be— That's the type of thing\nthat she would... You know what I mean?\nI could be wrong. But I feel like I've heard\nthat word before in wri— Sure.\nI could be wrong. 'Cause a lot of\nthese Swedish words – Sound the same. But I do think that... Stupid stuff. It's not gonna be a\nrandom piece of furniture. Probably.\nProbably not. Maybe I don't know\nwhat I'm talking about. But I feel like that's a\ngood starting place  right? Yeah. This feels achievable. My guess is that they didn't— It seems they didn't attempt this.\nNo. Decided that it\nwasn't worth the time. So our theory was correct. Which means that\nit was really smart of us to go here immediately. Right. If we had started\nthis in the morning... We would've been in\nthe same position they were. This is pretty IKEA esque.\nIt is. Boxes. Boxes. Yeah  okay  yep. Worth getting that\nand some tape. Also  I wonder if anywhere\nwe could buy ping pong balls. Because the birds must be at least the size\nof a ping pong ball. Yep.\nIs there a sports shop? Oh  Sam.\nMhm? Resistance bands. Yeah. From a sports shop.\nYeah. We need something to\nmake the slingshot or... Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Is there any tool that could... If you had a really wide wrench \nyou could make a slingshot. Oh! That and\nsome rubber bands. Yeah. It's pretty good. Okay  let's go with that. Then let's go to the sports shop\nand try and find balls. Oh  there's the toy shop. Oh.\nLet's look for stuff in there. Thank you.\nThank you. These things\ncould technically work. These actually aren't bad.\nDo they have a snout? They have a snout.\nThey have a snout. I mean  I think\nthat's our pig  Sam. Here is the ball section. What about tennis balls? Uhh  hello. Oh... are they smaller\nthan the plush? Yeah....?\nYes  yes they are. Tennis balls are a better shout. All rubber bands. Three—\nlight  medium  hard. Get a three pack. Okay. I mean  we're going\nup to the checkout with resistance bands\nand tennis balls  Sam. It's obvious we're up to mischief. Unless they already got to Malmö \nalready pulled the challenge  or already on the way\nto IKEA  Sam. There's no way. Uh-huh  they've\nsurprised us before. Look  I love your theory. I got nothing else. I love your theory. It's like  that word sounds\nvaguely familiar to me. It makes sense to me that Amy would pick\nthe giant teddy bear. We need this. We really need this. Thank you.\nKiitos. Alright  where can\nwe do this  Sam  that's not absolutely freezing? Well... I don't know if\nyou're gonna find that in this country  but... Good point. Somewhere sheltered. Oh  hang on.\nHere on the left. Welcome to\nthe Angry Birds dome. Stage one: construction. A little block there.\nWatch out  that's unstable. Oh yeah  it is!\nThat's what we want  but— Oh no  hang on.\nThe slingshot must go side on. Does it?\nIt's a 2D game. (chuckles anxiously) Watch me rotate this\nwithout it falling over. Oh  that's pretty\nimpressive  Tom. That is Angry Birds. I'm happy with that  Sam. Alright  how's the... How's our slingshot looking? Well  I'm just\ntrying to figure out the best way to construct\nthis  because... Okay. Oh  this might work actually. Just kind of hand hold.\nYeah. Yeah. I'll get you a tennis ball.\nHang on. Yeah  we might need\nmore slack. Eight feet away  which is... Well  I'll measure it. Eight feet. What's eight feet\nin centimetres  Sam? I don't know.\nBecause I don't speak\nyour ridiculous units. It's like two point... Two and two thirds meters. Just here?\nMhm. That's two and a half metres. Okay  I think I've gotta try\nto tape this on or something. Okay. Sam  I've only got a wide... I think they might have\ngone for it. Well that's—\nThey'll have reduced odds if they go for it. They will have reduced odds. But I think they might\nhave gone for it. I don't hate reduced odds.\nI don't hate reduced odds. 'Cause we really\nwant them to fail. Yeah  we do. Oh  they went for it! They went for it.\nThey went for it. Oh man. That's a lot. Oh  are they\nat the IKEA already? Are they?\nYes. They're at the stop for the IKEA. How did they\nget there that fast? Because they made\nthe correct connections at the right time.\nMm. Damn. There's the IKEA. Oh  there's a bridge\nstraight to the IKEA. I thought there was\na mistake for a second because I was like \nit's showing— it's saying we should just walk\ndirectly across the highway  over a field to the IKEA. Let's walk directly\nover the highway to the IKEA. Let's do it. DJUNGELSKOG  right? D-J-U-N. Okay  it's 5:02 \nwhich is actually... Our train got in\nseveral minutes late  so we might be... We might have a little\nless than 25 minutes. We should... move a little bit. The Swedish teens\nare laughing at us  Ben. Okay  okay. That's slingshotty.\n(rubber stretching) Yeah  yeah.\nIt even makes the noise! Yeah  Sam  put a ball in it. Mm.\nHold on. Can I try a thing  Sam? I think it's how\nyou're letting it go. Okay  that's—\nThat's how we do it. Good news  I nearly hit it. Alright  practice \npractice  practice. Why do we get backspin? That's so tricky.\nYeah. Okay  that was good.\nNever mind. That was good. Good.\nGood. Good. That was good. What you do is you pull back  you angle up  you fire. Good. I'm impressed at how\ngood this aim is. You pull back \nyou angle up  you fire. Nnngh. All we need is a one in three. Oh  well  and for\nit to work when we hit. True. We should take\na test shot at it. Yeah  we definitely should.\nIf it doesn't knock it down... Definitely should. Whoa. That one completely backfired. Hey  Tom  on the bright side?\nYeah? They're not in the IKEA yet. And it's 6:06.\nAlright. So they're reducing their odds And they are panicking.\n...slightly. There's less than\n25 minutes in the day. Oh god  this IKEA's three stories. Okay. Made it to IKEA. We're about two minutes late. So we only have\n23 minutes to do this. Start the time.\nAlright  here we go. Start looking.\nThere will be a map. We probably want to\nget to children's IKEA. Let's try there first.\nThat's my best inkling. Okay. Let's try that first. This is not the actual thing. Stop the ball if you can  Sam.\nYeah. We're gonna do some practice shots.\nBut if you can't stop the ball  then we'll know if it works. You pull back  you angle up  you fire. That would've hit.\nYeah  not— I'm not sure if it has\nenough force  but... Oh! That would've had—\nThat would've hit it. That would've had enough force.\nYeah. It was  you know...\nThe aim was not there  but... You pull back \nyou angle up... and you fluff it. (inhales sharply) Mmh. I don't like the\npressure for this  Sam. Pull back  twice  up. Fi— no  nope. Pull back. No  I can tell that wasn't working. What's wrong here? I think we may need to\nengineer a better slingshot. Yeah  I mean \ndo you have thoughts on how to do that? Unfortunately not.\nMm-kay. Maybe if we make it\na bit looser? That...\nSee  that was good. Wasn't on target \nbut it was good. Oh  we need beaks on these. Oh yeah.\nForgot the beaks. Yes!\nOkay. Well  no  but also... Good aim. There we go. That's it. Alright  you build.\nI'm gonna drill my shooting. Whoa! (laughs heartily) Sorry  Sam! Okay  that says \"Skog Duva\" which makes me think\nthat SKOGS is... Like plush.\nPlush. Yeah.\nSo I really like that. \"Skog-duva\".\nThis all says SKOGS— But that all says SKOGS \nwhich I think is a really good sign that you could be right. Because it was\nDJUNGELSKOG  right? Yep.\nOkay  is it this way? Or is this... No  this was a maze. Okay  no  no  no.\nThis was wrong. What's the way outta here? I'm still just\nlooking at everything. That thing's plush. What is?\nWhat's this called? BLÅVINGAD.\nBLÅVINGAD. Let's just keep moving.\nChildren— I'm trying to check the signs.\nNo  I understand. I understand. \"Akrins\" AXSTAD. Bänkskivor. None of these things. None of these things. That's RÅSKOG. Wait  RÅSKOG? But that's like a... Okay  well I don't like\nthat piece of information. But let's just keep going. That was spot on! Sorry about that. Oh yes. Oh yes. Yeah. Sam  I'm getting this.\nThat's great. Sam  I'm starting\nto dial this in. I knew it was good. I knew it was good\nbefore it'd even left the slingshot. Alright  Tom.\nYeah? Let's consider\nthe next three a test. Yeah. Let's see if\nyou can get the spot in one of these three.\nAlright. There we go.\nThat would've gotten it. Probably.\nBorderline. There we go.\nYou got two out of three. I did. Let's keep going until\nI get three in a row. Okay  this way. FAMNIG HJÄRTA. Okay  that's big heart. But we're still going. Okay  based on the map... we still got a ways to go. We're at three and\nchildren's isn't until 10. Mhm.\nOne. Two in a row. Three in a row. That was a little too far left.\nAlright. My aim's not great now. Sam  my hand's gonna get tired\nif I keep doing this. I've locked it in. I think let's\npractice it for real. 'Cause it's possible there are\ncertain shots that won't... Okay. I'm happy to keep\nreconstructing it. Alright  so these are\nlive fire practices. Yeah. Alright  let's\nmake this your first. That would've gotten it.\nThat would've gotten it. But there were\nmultiple stuffed animals that said 'SKOG'. Right? What are these? DJUNGELSKOG.\nWait  what? These are DJUNGELSKOG? DJUNGELSKOG.\n(wheezes) This—\nBecause it's a monkey. 'Cause it's a monkey. Because it's in the jungle!\nOh my god. DJUNGEL— It's a\nSKOG from the jungle. It's a SKOG from the jungle.\nOkay  wait  wait  wait  wait. Let's send it to Amy.\nLet's send it to Amy. Oh... my... god. Let's (bleep)-ing go. Ohh!\nYou wanna buy him? I'll take him on\nthe rest of our journey. Yeah  yeah. I think that\nwe should buy him for Amy. 'Cause she's— I know she said\nwe didn't have to bring it to her  but— We're gonna get her\nher DJUNGELSKOG. Alright  wait  wait  wait. No  we gotta call Tom and Sam. Oh no. Oh no.\nOh. Are we getting the call?\nWe're getting the call. Oh no! It wasn't the bear.\nIt was the monkey. It's a DJUNGELSKOG.\nCheck out our DJUNGELSKOG. Yeah.\nYeah. Alright  you've stolen it.\nAlright  we gotta go. We gotta go. Bye! Bye. Wow  that's absolutely huge stuff. Okay  well let's check out\nand go get outside the IKEA. Wow. So that flips the score \nwhich was 8–7. Now it's 7–8. And they haven't\neven locked Finland. And the day's almost over.\nYep. (growls) That puts the score\nto 8–7 to them  Sam. Yeah. It's not great Tom  but... No it's not. Hopefully they\ndon't get Denmark and... Oh  I was feeling—\nI thought— Yeah  so was I! Ugh. Mmmgh  just minutes. Minutes of—\nMinutes. Alright  live fire\npractice round two. This is your first\nof three attempts. There we go— oh!\nNot to the ground. Ah. There we go. Not to the—\nYes to the ground. Oh!\nIt's close. Nope  misfire. Hope you don't have the yips. Dunno what that means. But I do know\nwhat that means. Nice. No. Boom.\nThere we go. If you wanna call it and go for it  'cause you have the feel \ngo for it. I think there's logic in\ntaking the time we have  but if you just feel\nlike you've got it and don't wanna mess it up more \nI understand. Also  hand and arm\nare getting tired. It's up to you. Pressure's\ngonna get to me  Sam. Pressure's gonna get to me. Let's do  I think\nthis is number seven. But you're well beyond\n50% at this point. Little left. Little high. Well also... I just wanna imagine\nthat's Ben and Adam getting to IKEA  you know? Oh  that was good. It seems to help. Do you wanna go for it? We're going for it. Three shots to lock Finland. Three shots for glory. Gimme a bird. These are our beak ones. These have beaks  alright.\nLet's hope that doesn't— I hope dry beaks\ndoesn't throw me off. Alright.\nRight  aim. Aim. Aim.\nFor the glory  Tom. Ben and Adam—\nNo  that was not correct. Ben and Adam at IKEA. No! It's alright  Tom.\nWe got two more. Ball number two. I knew it was wrong\nthe minute it left my hand. Lock in. Lock in. Feel it out. Well  what I need to do\nis just get angry! (sighs harshly) Stay calm. I don't think you need to get angry.\nI think you need to stay calm. I'm not gonna lie.\nIt's not great. Oh. Call 'em. I hate that you're grinning.\nI know why you're grinning. Because it's to throw them off.\nBut I hate that you're grinning. I'm grimacing. Oh. Oh  that's\nalso a DJUNGELSKOG. Oh  maybe they're all DJUNGELSKOG.\n'Cause they're— they— These are also\nkind of from the jungle. I think they're just\nmultiple DJUNGELSKOGs. But that's— I was\nthinking of that guy. Dude  you nailed it. You nailed it.\nYou nailed it  Ben. 100% vindicated.\nI knew what DJUNGELSKOG was. What's the news  boys? Finland is undefended. Oh boy.\nWow. This has been\na tough day for you. That's a rough day  boys. It's been a really rough day. I've had a lot of fun. If it makes\nyou feel any better  you can keep the DJUNGELSKOG. That's actually not true. We have Amy—\nWe got it for Amy. Good luck.\nGood luck. Bye. Bye. Oh  DJUNGELSKOG.\nWhat have they gotten into now? Those poor boys. (grumbles profusely) Hey  at least they can come\nto Finland now and fail this. Who knows? I had it locked in  Sam. Yeah.\nI cracked under the pressure. It's tough. It's just like golf. Golf is hard.\nGolf is hard because it's— it requires such calmness. I'mma be mad at\nmyself all night now 'cause it's the end of\nthe game day  right? It's... What time is it?\nPretty much  yeah. How long do we have?\nWe have five minutes. Well  we need to\nWe need to clean this up. clean this up a little bit. I guess let's walk\ntowards the station. Yeah. Between us  I'm taking quite a bit\nof the blame for this. We are not as good\nat challenges as they are. Certainly not\nbased on the statistics. Right? Tomorrow  we speedrun. Tomorrow we let them chase us. We let them come here and\nspend a huge amount of time trying to build Angry Birds\nand do it. We let them spend a huge\namount of time on everything  and we run. I think it's the only\nlogical thing to do at this point. It's the only thing we can do.\nWe have a lot of flight budget. We have two days left. Maybe we can just outrun them. Okay  so we've got\na few extra minutes left in the day. We're just gonna go\nback to the station and end our day there. So we can get up bright and early\nand go back to Copenhagen. Big day. Big day. We pulled it back.\nWe pulled it back. I think if we can pull\nDenmark out  then they are in big  big \nbig  big trouble. I couldn't agree more. Anyway  we've got\n15 seconds  so... Alright  well\nwe're at the junction of Fredriksgatan and  uh \nSödra Jarnvägsgatan. Vuhh  close enough. We are outside\nwhatever that place is that says Art and Ham. So I guess first thing\nin the morning  we head to the airport. First thing in the morning \nwe head to the airport  Sam  and we run. Okay  well...\nWell... End of the day. It's 5:30 pm  and this guy\nneeds to go to bed. Yeah  he has gotten\na li'l cranky. Alright  we will see you\ntomorrow morning  7:30 am at this exact location. And then we're gonna\ndo a perfect job and win the game  I think. I think\nThat's my plan. that's a very good plan. It's my plan.\nAnd I think we should do it. Okay  we'll see you\ntomorrow morning. Good night.\n(both smooching) Alright  6:30.\nSee you tomorrow. Good night. ♪ Good morning \ngood morning ♪ ♪ It's 7:30 am \ngood morning ♪ We're at \"Svåger-top\". It's a brisk morning\nhere in Sweden. It's cold and...\nIt is cold. I fear there's a possibility that we will end up\nsomewhere even colder today. Very possible. But for now  we are\ngoing to Copenhagen to attempt the Denmark steal  and then we will figure out where to next. Let's go to Copenhagen. Welcome to day five.\nGood morning! We're so back.\nIt's still dark out  Tom. (cackles) This is a long night.\nYeah. Well  let's walk to the station.\nYes. 'Cause I think the first move is inevitably gonna be\na train to the airport. Yeah  we did look\nat ferries  but... the flights have been\nway cheaper than expected. So we still have\nflight budget left. It's faster. It gets us\nto more connections. We're going by plane.\nYeah. We think we're getting\nto the point in the game where there is diminishing value\nof locking countries. Diminishing.\nNot zero  but diminishing. Increasing value of just\nsimply claiming countries. Yeah  and on\nthe flight yesterday I managed to identify\na three-jump sequence that would get us\nthree countries claimed today  which at this point in the game\nis almost impossible. The catch is... that we can't book the next flight\nuntil we land... and the connections are tight. The state of the game now \nTom  is basically that... Ben and Adam are\n24 hours behind us. They're starting from Malmö. We started from Malmö.\nYeah. They'll start heading\ntowards Copenhagen a little bit earlier than we did \nbut not by that much. And they will pull\nthe challenge immediately and find they cannot even\nstart it until 10 am. Well  yeah.\nUnless they find a LEGO store. (laughs) Unless they find\na LEGO store. Yeah  okay. 'Cause if they\nwere paying attention to the tracker closely  they probably would've\nfigured out that... We went to the airport\nand there wasn't LEGO there. And they do have the advantage\nof knowing that we failed. So that does give 'em\nan advantage  and just  they know that they need to be more methodical\nand come up with... you know  that it is\nhighly failable. How did...\n\"Y-Yungel-skorp\" sleep? What's his name? Oh  not well. He kept waking me up. But he's  you know \nhe's very young  so he can't get through it. He can't sleep\nthrough the night yet. Whoof! I am a little worried about\nthis Denmark challenge 'cause it took them a long time\nand then they failed. Yeah. It's not a good sign. No. A little scary. And I will say\nit is still the case that we have not  no one... has succeeded at a challenge\nanother team failed. It's true. Because seemingly\nthey didn't even try this Sweden one. No  they didn't\neven attempt it. I still believe\nour instructions were as good as\nthey could possibly be on that set  Sam. I struggle to see\nhow we could have sped that up by 25%.\nRight  yeah. What would've done it was—-\nwould've been a different LEGO set. Yeah.\nSo  they'll do that  and then their best\nflight to Helsinki is the same one that we took.\nSame one that we took. Which means they will come here\nand they'll try and do Angry Birds. You know  one interesting thing that I saw  Tom?\nWhat's that? So starting around\nlike 1 pm today... Uh-huh? It starts snowing\npretty strong here. Okay.\nAnd I don't know— I mean  obviously\nit snows a lot here. I'm sure the airport can\nhandle a lot of snow  but... Maybe  I mean \nit continues into tomorrow. Maybe they face some difficulties. I've been trapped\nin Oslo Airport before. Uh-huh.\nBecause of snow. Look  even the best airports \nthey just get backed up with de-icing and runway clearing\nand stuff like that. I think our biggest\nadvantage today  Tom  is that if they are just replicating our day yesterday...\nYeah. We know they're\ngoing to move slow. And we know the challenges\nare gonna be difficult. Yeah  and... if the— if we move fast \nwhile they're moving slow... that could...\nThat's the plan. start to gain us an advantage.\nThat is the plan. Alright.\nSo  Sam... Let's get to the airport.\nLet's move fast. I mean  let's—\nWe're not in a rush. The flight's at 11.\nSo we've actually got loads of time. But you know  metaphorically \nlet's move fast. Now we gotta transfer\non the train to Copenhagen. Seemingly  'train'... in Swedish is 'tåg'  which sort of makes... our game tag into\na really fun pun here. Copenhagen. (yawns) Everybody....\nwants to go to Copenhagen. We've done it. We've boarded\nthe train to Copenhagen. Just barely. Good news  it's\nonly a 30 minute train. Airport  six minutes \nplatform two. Did you book the flight yet?\nNo  we can do it on the train. We were kinda busy yesterday. Yeah  well  we also didn't know\nwe necessarily wanted it yet. That's true. Still dark. (laughs) Starting to get—\nSorry  Finland. We've not really shown you\nin the best light here  have we? Is that a pun? ...Yes  I absolutely\nintended that. Okay.\nYeah  100%. Alright  Tom  the... The 11:15 to Vilnius:\nstill available. Yep. It'll be a total of 308 euros\nfor the two of us. For the two of us?\nYeah. We've been really lucky\nwith flight prices  Sam. Mhm. And the potential\nconnections onward looking good? Looks on time.\nI can double check the price. Here we go. We identified there's a... three-flight route. We can go to Lithuania... then Poland... then maybe... Croatia. I'm not convinced by Croatia. I'm not convinced\nby Croatia either. But the timing is perfect.\nIt gets in at 5:20. Even if we don't make\nthe third country... we have a chance to\nlock a massive country in case it goes to a tiebreaker.\nWe need the area bonus. I think you said yesterday that even though\nwe don't have the luck  we have to play risky here\nto try and stay ahead. Yeah. Adam and Ben have a\nless risky path of victory than us. Yeah. Alright. Book it.\nWe're going to Vilnius. Let's do it. It's gonna be\nreally embarrassing if it turns out to be\npronounced 'vil-nis' or something like that. Jet Lag staple.\nMispronouncing places. We are booked. Next stop  Lithuania. The lads are moving\nat speed through Denmark. They are nearly back\nat Copenhagen. Back... in Copenhagen. Are you ready to\nsimply lock in  Benjamin? Ohh  I have never been\nmore ready to lock in in my life. Denmark  have no fear. Ben and Adam have arrived\nto rescue you from Tom and Sam. Adam  are you ready to see\nwhat the Denmark challenge is? I'm ready  Benjamin.\nOkay. Attempting to steal\nwith this challenge. Build a LEGO set blind.\nOh dear. Build a LEGO set blind. Denmark: the birthplace of LEGOs. Build a LEGO set with\nat least 200 pieces in under 45 minutes \nand for some good fun  do it blindfolded. Only one team member\nmust be blindfolded. This team member must\ndo all the assembly. The other team member\nmay use the instructions to guide the blindfolded builder  but is not allowed to\nassemble the LEGOs himself. He may hold and move\nexactly one piece at a time  as long as he doesn't\nput pieces together or take them apart. Well  step one is going to be\nacquiring a LEGO set. It's 8 am and I don't know that you can buy LEGOs\nat 8 am. May be tough. Here's something that I know. We both love LEGOs. We do. We are intimately\nacquainted with LEGOs. Back at the airport.\nTom  Tom. Yeah?\nGive us tunnel facts. This is the northernmost underground railway\nstation in the world. Yay. I looked that up yesterday after you said give us\nsome tunnel facts  and I didn't have any. The lads have made it to Copenhagen Central Station. Okay  so probably about now\nthey're realizing that... (chuckles)\nhopefully... They cannot do a challenge\nfor another 40 minutes. That's actually not as bad as—\nNo  time zones  Tom. One hour and 40 minutes. Mm. If they've just pulled\nthe challenge... then they're desperately\nlooking around for anywhere that might sell LEGO\nthat is not the LEGO Store. There's a LEGO Store...\nOh  in the airport. In the airport?\nWell  this is what I was gonna say. I figure that the only place\nyou can buy LEGOs at 8 am is the airport. So we're gonna have to...\n(imitates swishing) Maybe.\nUnless it would be faster to wait for\nanother place to open. Let me see. No  no. I think we need to start\nheading to the airport  frankly. Well  my— Is the\nLEGO Store before security? I don't know\nthe answer to that. Worst case scenario \nwe could get our next ticket. Yeah.\nAnd just go in  and then leave. My opinion is we should just\nhead to the airport right now 'cause that's where\nthe LEGOs are and we should go from there.\nOkay. 'Cause there's a train\nin two minutes. CPH Lufthavn.\nYeah. It's track two.\nOkay  great. So what we need to\nfigure out is  one  how can we get these LEGOs\nas quickly as possible? And then two  how can we... then get as quickly as possible \nthree miles away from the airport to do the LEGOs and then\ngo back to the airport? Kind of an album cover. Thank you  Tom. So Tom  you remember\nhow I was telling you that it gets snowy this afternoon?\nYeah. It's not that many yet.\nNot yet. But look  there's\n1  2  3  4  5 cancellations already this afternoon.\nNow  two of those names – Oulu  Rovaniemi –\nthey're far north. They're far north.\nSo the snow's moving in there. But not Geneva and Tallinn. Yeah.\nAnd not New York. And it's not like\nthey're just delayed. They just flat out cancelled 'em.\nSo maybe shortage of aircraft? Hopefully these are omens\nfor difficulty for Ben and Adam. Hopefully if they're\ntrying to fly here. 'Cause I bet they won't\nlook up the weather. They don't— They don't—\nNo. They always assume\nthe best case scenario. (laughs)\nI mean  so far that's worked out\npretty well for them. Okay. We've arrived at the airport.\nNot for a flight  but for LEGOs. Sure hope that... LEGOs are pre-security. I'm just getting grumpy\nanytime I see LEGO now. There's a toy shop just there. I can only assume that Ben and Adam are in a\nsimilar position right now. Yeah  should we\ncheck their location? Yeah  let's see\nwhat they're up to. Oh  they've done\nthe same move as us. They've gone to the airport?\nThey've gone to the airport. Oh! There's also the possibility\nthey do what we didn't. They book their next flight \ngo through security  get a LEGO  leave  and then come back.\n(chuckles) 'Cause we know that you can\nget LEGOs post-security. Yeah  but you\ndon't save much time. You know  by the time\nthey get back to Central  yeah  it'd be almost 10  and they might not\nget the best LEGO. And there's a better\nselection at the LEGO shop. Well actually we\ndid see a better LEGO post-security yesterday.\nYes we did  didn't we? At Copenhagen Airport.\nOh  we did. We found the LEGO shop.\nTom  look at this one. This one would've been doable. And that one\nwould've been doable. Oh no. Yeah. Alright. Yeah  so far \ntheir tracker is pre-security. I wonder if they went through\nthe same logical jumps we did. We could  if they\nwere post-security  buy a ticket on the flight\nthat we think we want to take. And then go in. It'll take a little while \nbut we might have to. Yeah  I'm pretty sure\nthat that is post-security. Almost certainly. Yeah  I think we might\nhave to buy a ticket and go into the airport\nto buy these LEGOs. So now  the question is where do we think\nwe might want to go next? So just looking at the map \nlooking at what's remaining... are there decent flights\nto anywhere in Poland? No. Definitely not. Yeah  I mean \nOslo's just right up there. Right  because it's\nnot a huge airport. (gasps) We can fly into... What time? It doesn't give us\na ton of time to do this— Well  it gives us basically\nno time to do this. Yeah  but we have\nto get in past security  get the thing  go three miles \ndo the whole challenge  get back to the airport. We have an hour\nand a half to do this. That means we have 45 minutes to go  boom  out  attempt  back here  go. I think this is our best flight.\nOkay. So we think we have\na route that looks good. We can fly to a kind of\nweird airport in Norway and then have time to\nmake a connection down and end the day\nin Warsaw  Poland  which we feel like is a really... solid way to pick up\ntwo countries today. It doesn't give us the most time to get the LEGOs and\ndo this challenge  but I think that this...\nI think this is a good flight. Okay  get those tickets. How much time are\nwe gonna have here? So I think we want— So we realistically don't have a lot of prep time. But that's okay. Let's assume that we got\nto the shop in the airport. This is what we'd have found \nand that's probably— The Minecraft stuff\nwould be pretty easy  I think. Oh  that's...\nThat's blocky. 238 pieces maybe. But there's a lot of\ntiny little things that have to be put together\nprecisely there as well. But I think\nfewer than with ours. 'Cause ours was\nThat's true. one of these or something.\nYeah. Egh. Okay  the DJUNGELSKOG\ngot flagged in security  so Adam is dealing with that. I'm running to just see\nif I can find a LEGO set. Okay  there are LEGO sets here. We need something\nthat's 200 pieces. Closest to 200 pieces. 82  204? It's pretty good. But I feel like we\nwant something that is as repetitive as possible. One of these  325. 278  no. Mini orchid  274  no. How many pieces is this? This doesn't even say. Okay  so... not all these sets\nhave piece numbers. But I looked this one up.\nIt has 220. Which is slightly more\nthan that Harry Potter one  but it's very repetitive \nwhich I think will be useful. Okay  I found the perfect LEGO set \nbut I don't know where Adam is. (no speech) We really  really can't\nafford this  okay. This.\nPerfect. 220 pieces.\nIt's all repetitive. Let's go. How's their tracker looking? Alright  let's see\nhow they're doing. It looks like they were airside and now they're not? So did they do\nthe thing we didn't? They went airside to buy and then they're going\nback into the city? Because they know\nwhere they're going. They might have been\nable to find the LEGO set that we found at the airport. Yeah.\nThat we thought would be good. If they found\nthat pride LEGO set... that's gonna be easy.\nOh yeah  they are... They are outside.\nThey are definitely landside now. Okay  yeah  this is not good. If we want any chance \nany chance of making that flight  we need to take the 10:15\nfrom this station  back here. So we're gonna get in  9:45. We gotta just start immediately. We'll have\nhalf an hour to try it. Well  and you got stuck for... Something. I still think we can\nmaybe pull it off. Where are they?\nWhat are they doing? Alright.\nGate 11. Let's get outta here\nbefore Helsinki freezes over. No more cancellations yet. That was a pun. That was just completely wasted.\nCompletely wasted. Okay. As soon as we get\nthree miles from the airport... we can start.\nYou got a blindfold? Great. As soon as we get three miles. Okay. There's our plane  Tom.\nI think this is gonna be... Ah.\npropeller plane... Good little plane.\ndebut on Jet Lag: The Game. I like this. Is it bad that just\nfor 5 or 10 seconds  I couldn't actually remember\nwhere we were going? It's all a blur. (laughs) I think it's Latvia. It's not. It's Lithuania. It's one of those two.\n(continues laughing) Okay  we're gonna just build\non top of this box. Okay. Gimme a second. Okay. There's three? There's three flowers.\nOkay. Okay  take this.\nOkay. Now  okay  we're gonna...\nput that down actually  sorry. We're gonna build\nsix of these  okay? Okay.\nSo  here's this. Okay.\nThis flat  okay? Okay. So you're gonna put\nthe— this on there. It's— There's only\none way it can go. Super easy  yep. And then you're gonna\nput this on the other side. Oh. Where'd it go?\nWhere'd it go? It's right there.\nIt's right there. Hold it— Hand it to me. Okay. Okay  and we're just\ndoing that six times. Got it  love it. I'm ready. Doing good. Doing great. One more. I thought there was six.\nWas this six? This is six.\nOkay. Okay  so now... take this wheel and we're gonna clip\nthose equidistant around. Yep  just like that  perfect. Okay  put that down. Okay.\nYep  put that down. Okay  so we're gonna\nmake six of these. I love when we have to\nmake six of something. There's no way\nthat plane has Wi-Fi. We are not gonna know\nthe results until we land. If we find out the result of this\nwhile we're still here... we've been delayed. Unless they nail it\nin 15 minutes. Oh  okay  yes. If they call us immediately \nthen we're in trouble. Yeah. Here's another one. Here  here  here. This guy  this guy  this guy. Now you're gonna put that guy\non top of that guy  okay? The one that you just built. Yep  j— no  flip... Yeah  yeah  yeah  perfect.\nOkay  put that down. Now we're just doing\nstick time. Love it. There you go.\nWe're moving quick. We got plenty of time. I'm gonna hand you this.\nYou're gonna put it in the top. And then your flower\nis gonna go right on top of that. Okay?\nThis way? Yep.\nGood? Yep  yep.\nYou got the first flower. What I hope is happening \nI hope that right now  one of them is just\nvery  very frustrated. I don't really mind which one. I just want one of them\nto be really annoyed. Yeah. They're gonna be really\npeaceful and calm aren't they? Stick. Gidgy. Stick. Gidgy. Stick. Gidgy. Stick. Gidgy. What is the second word\nyou're saying? Gidgy.\nGidgy? It's like a little gidgy. Imagine you're actually\non Ben and Adam's side. I know we're not. Imagine it. What advice\nwould you give them? For doing the challenge?\nYeah. It would've been useful\nif we had ahead of time agreed on terminology.\nThat's true. Because up meant up... Well...\nYeah. It was like out  in \nleft  right  up  down. Except sometimes it was\nup-down or front-back. You'd say rotate 90 degrees. There are three possible axes\nand sometimes it's obvious if it's a long  flat piece.\nRight. But if it's\njust vaguely cubic... Yeah. If we had taken just five minutes\nto standardize terminology  we could have saved\na little bit of time. Yeah. Okay  so rotate it\nso that the pointiest part of the petal...\nYeah. So you're holding a petal.\nPointy like that? This way? This orientation? So make sure the pointy part\nis facing the sky. Yeah.\nYes  facing the sky. No  no  no.\nIt's not facing the sky. How is it not facing the sky?\nRotate it  rotate it. No  rotate it the other way.\nThis? No  no.\nNo? Rotate it.\nLike this? Nope. Okay  what the (bleep)? This? That— You're\ntouching the pointy part. This?\nYeah. Okay  now just flip it\n180 degrees. Yeah  yeah  yeah  okay.\nNow stick that on there. It needs to go up.\nLike that? Yeah  that's perfect. Okay.\nOkay. And we are just\ngonna need to do that on each side. Zero Celsius  Sam. Balmy. (laughs) Okay  third flower. So I believe that this is\nactually the exact same flower. But in a different color.\nI guess that doesn't matter to you. So you know this well.\nHere's your wheel. You're gonna put the wheel down. Now we're making\nsix little petals. Okay.\nWe know how to do that  okay? Boom. Here's this  this  and this. This  this  and this. And this. Isn't LEGOs so fun? Yep  yep  yep  yep. We love Denmark. Yep  yep  yep. Okay  got it. Okay  so now we're building\nthe core thing again  okay? Yep.\nPerfect. And you're gonna go ahead\nand put that right on the middle of your flower. And Adam  I have\ngood news for you. It's time to\nbuild the long stick? It's time to\nbuild the long stick. Let's do it.\nThere you go. And we're just gonna\ngo one at a time. Folks... The botanical set is the\nreal key to this challenge. Can you imagine if we had\na regular LEGO set? Yeah  well  I almost bought\na Harry Potter one. Jesus. And then I was like \nno  it's just gonna be  I was like... I gotta find one that is... easier to repeat  okay. Yep  yep  yep  yep  yep. God  this rules.\nYep. And yep. Boom  boom  boom. Finally this. And you're gonna go ahead\nand pick up your flower and you're gonna pop\nthat right on there. Is that it?\nAnd Adam... that is it  in 24 minutes. Ohhh! (bleep) yeah! Let's go! Here's our lovely bouquet. Okay  what's the next train\nback to the airport? Let's (bleep)-ing go! (coughs profusely) Let's go. That was incredible. We still might\nmiss this flight. So we gotta... (cracks up) We gotta go. We gotta go. Oh  no. No  no  no  no  no \nno  no  no  no  no  no. They're calling early.\nThey're calling early. It's concerning. This is bad.\nThis is bad. This is bad. They're gonna show us a... fully completed LEGO set. We have some flowers for you! We built some\nincredible LEGO flowers. Do you wanna know\nhow long it took us? 27 minutes. I'm gonna hang up on them. Yeah. (blurts laugh) That's tough for them.\nThey did not have much to say. What's really annoying... is that that's one of\nthe sets we rejected. Actually... These are... These are kids' ones?\nThese are kids' ones? It's not great  Tom.\nIt's not great. It's not great. What does that make it? Pretty hard to beat\nis what it makes the score. Whew. Okay  back to the airport. Nope. I think you're allowed to leave\nthe airport and come back. Yeah. Yeah. Look. It's gonna be tight. We're not out of the woods yet. Alright buddy. Let's do it. Okay. Okay  the flight boards\nin what  15 minutes? Boarding starts\nin 15 minutes  yeah. Okay. Then let's boogie. Okay. Let's hope that it lets us\nback in the airport. Yeah. I thought this might happen. It's not letting us back in\n'cause I think we left the airport  so we have to talk to a person. Hi  it said to see agent. We checked in  but then we left\nthe airport. So now we're back. We need to go down to SAS? Okay  our flight\nleaves in 45 minutes. Thank you. Okay. Oh shoot. Not a chance.\nLook at those lines. Talk to SAS. Is there any way\nto get to a person that's not through\none of these crazy lines? Service point?\nSAS service point? Hi  we checked in and\nwent through security  but we are here. Yes.\nYeah. Our flight leaves— Okay.\nThank you. Thank you. Oh  shoot. Hello. It's digital. Uh-huh. The flight leaves in 43 minutes. Okay  thank you.\nThank you. Thank you.\nThank you. That was faster than\nI thought it would be. That was pretty good. Okay  up  up  up.\nYep. Okay  camera has to go off\nwhile we go through security. Wish us luck. Okay  I made it through this time. Ben's bag got pulled. What news  Sam? It doesn't have it. What? It doesn't show up. The connection to Warsaw? It's not bookable. Sam... I... If we don't make that... and they take Finland... ...we're done. Yeah. Can we at least get to Estonia to stop them taking\nthe ferry south tomorrow? Even if they're snowed in? There's a Riga\nand Tallinn flight. There's a Riga flight. I can check that. Let's check that. Are we? Are we still? Are we still— Okay. Oh. Welcome to Lithuania  Tom. Oh  yeah. I wish we had better news here\nother than just another bus. Yeah  a lot of bus gates. Okay. Flight has been\ndelayed 20 minutes. I think we're gonna make it.\nWe're gonna be just fine. We would like to\ngive a huge shoutout to Diego at the\nCopenhagen Airport who put us in fast track security. Yeah  on the\ncondition that we... We shout him out. shout out Diego at\nthe Copenhagen Airport. That to me is a very good deal. Okay. I think we are\ngoing to make it to this place near Oslo.\nYep. Look Ben  we recognize this. Off to Sandefjord. Sandefjord. I've always wanted\nto go to Sandefjord. Me too. Since two and a half hours ago  I've always wanted\nto go to Sandefjord. I was really... excited to go to Sandefjord\nwhen I learned that it was a place. You know you're going\nsomewhere weird when you do this to\nget on the plane. There are not a lot of people\non this plane to Sandefjord  Norway. But... But we are certainly on it. But we are certainly on it\nand we are happy to be on it. We are learning a lot\nof words for 'arrivals'  Sam. This is a very\ndifferent vibe of airport than the other ones we've been in.\nYeah. Yeah  because that appears\nto be just a town over there. Yeah. That's just\nthe end of a street. I imagine this is just\nVilnius's original airport. I guess. Or at least a rather old one. Because they haven't built\nairports like this in a while. I mean  I wish we were\nseeing more of Lithuania. Well  I don't  I wish we were on a flight to Poland\nvery shortly  but... Yeah. Okay  should we head inside\nLet's head in. And make our plan? We need to figure out\nwhich flight we are taking. How many airports\nhave you seen that look like this  Tom? It's really nice. It's very train station esque. Right? Geez  this is... Okay!\nThis is unique. Well  here's a good\nplanning spot  Tom. Okay  so the first thing is\nwe are not taking the flight that is honestly\nthe reason we came here. Yeah. It's sold out. To Warsaw.\nBecause it's sold out. And not only is it sold out  but...\nIt's a thousand. The price went up to... 1 100 euros for the two of us. Great  yeah. So I mean  our next best option\nseems to be... It's either\nthe 15:15 to Tallinn or the 15:20 to Riga  and we really need to call that\nin the next few minutes so we don't get locked out.\nYes. So I've just checked\nboth Tallinn and Riga. There are no onward\nconnections we can make today. Okay.\nSo... That's really bad news.\nSo... it seems like... between Riga and Tallinn... only Riga has a flight that\ngets us anywhere useful at a decent time\ntomorrow morning. Yes. We could in theory\nsteal Liechtenstein. Yeah. Maybe we could\nsteal Liechtenstein and get to Luxembourg. Yeah  or somewhere else  yeah. Or somewhere  anywhere. Book. Book  book  book  book.\nGet us to Riga  Sam. Get us to Riga.\nIt is the only option we have left. I just noticed  I mean  I think this will make\nour decision earlier  but flights are\ndiverting from Tallinn. What? It must be getting\nthe same snow. That snowstorm's arrived. Yeah  but just from Tallinn— The Warsaw to Tallinn flight!\nWe were thinking of getting that! Yeah. Yeah  I mean  hopefully\nthe weather's better in Riga. Riga looks alright.\nCloudy conditions. Yeah  Riga's good. Riga's good. Okay. Oh  let's hope for terrible \nterrible weather in Helsinki. At least we didn't go\nto Tallinn! Let me book to Riga. The— It said  unfortunately \nwe are unable to confirm this flight fare that we offered you\nbecause of technical issues. Oh no.\nAnd it's actually 830 euros. Oh my god! (laughs hysterically) (sighs) Because if we take that flight \nwe then can't take any more. The budget's gone. Pretty much. And we can't go to Tallinn because of the weather that\nwe were complaining about. We can try.\nWe can try. Let me see what happens\nif we try to book to Tallinn. Lemme see what\nflight they're on. Sam  I'm... We've been certain they've\nbeen going to Helsinki  right? Yeah? I can't find either of them\non the tracker. And Adam was last seen\nin the airport an hour ago?\nYeah? But that's— So they didn't take the flight\nthat we took then. No. Where might they have gone? There's a flight to Nice. That makes a little bit of sense \nbut not a ton. No  no  'cause that'd\njust give them Monaco  right? Unless they just wanna\ngo somewhere warm. We're here in Norway. Welcome to Norway. What's this place called again?\nWhere are we? Sp— Spa— Svag— I don't know. They've landed.\nThey're in Norway. In Oslo?\nIn— In— Well  it says \"Skaggrak\". Skagerrak  Skagerrak?\nIt's the secondary... They must have been on\nthat flight that I thought  so... Yeah. If they're gonna\nthe secondary airport  that probably means\nthey're gonna try to lock. We should go to Tallinn. Oh  although...\nWhat? There is a Warsaw\nthat they could make... Oh no! That gets in early enough\nfrom that airport. Oh no. Okay  there's a bus\nin three minutes that we really want to\nmake  buddy. I don't think\nthis airport is that big. Let's explain to the poor audience\nwhat we're doing because they're probably\nvery confused. Okay. It's not that confusing. We just have to get\nthree miles from the airport. And so we're taking\na bus to the train station and we'll take a train until\nwe're three miles away. It's not so bad. That's exactly\nwhat we're doing. And then we're gonna go ahead\nand open the Norway challenge. But we wanna kinda do it quickly because there's a flight\noutta here to Warsaw  Poland  which is kind of our\nwhole reason for coming here  was that it was\nsuch a good connection  so... Yeah.\nPriority número uno is... Make that flight.\nMake that flight. Gotta make that flight. The sun is already going down.\nWhat time is it? It's almost one. Oh  well \nthat's basically nighttime. Okay  so... Hello. We're on the train. We're gonna get off in Tønsberg. Yes  that's what\nwe're going to do. How do you pronounce\nthat O with the— that guy? No one knows. There's no one in the world\nwho knows how to pronounce it. Too bad. We're getting off in Tønsberg and then we're gonna\ngo ahead and open this guy and see if we can go ahead\nand lock up Norway. If we go to Riga  we haven't got enough\nflight budget left to get to places we'd need. Yeah. The only other flight we have out of here is Tallinn.\nOh. There's no— There's\nliterally no other choice  Sam. Book Tallinn. I mean  okay.\nLet's check for the 20th time. Yeah. Warsaw  we can't take. No.\nSold out. Our only option now  Sam... Now the Warsaw flight\nis unavailable  the only option is Tallinn. Okay. No? I don't know what\nto tell you  buddy. It's just not showing up. What  it's sold out? It must be. It's not showing up anymore.\nOkay. Okay  hello  camera.\nHello  camera. So the flight that we wanted\nto connect to out of here... That flight is—\ndoes not exist anymore. And now we are in... the middle of absolute nowhere\nin Norway. I just don't...\nSo that's kind of fun. So that's kind of fun. Alright  so we have a little— We have an hour and\n40 minutes 'til our flight. Okay. I'm gonna force you\nto go outside  Tom. (laughs) We're in Lithuania.\nThat's fair. We need to look at Lithuania.\nThat's fair. The Lithuanians\nare gonna be mad if we don't look at Lithuania. Clever.\nIt's really cold outside. So make sure to set\nthe automatic doors so you have to get close to 'em. There is an airport train station.\nIt's not much  but there is one. Also...\nIt's single track. Yeah  and I do like just the catenary there.\nIt looks really nice. That's not a design\nI've seen before. See  Lithuania has\nelectrified railways. You know where it doesn't? Most of the United States? Yep.\nYeah. Alright.\nAlright. We have come to\nthis street corner to appreciate Lithuania. We appreciate Lithuania and the point it has given us. Okay  it is kind of cold. Back to the airport. Do you wanna go get\nthrough security? They appear to\nhave left the airport. Okay. So I guess\nthey're trying to claim? They're either trying to claim or get to the other\nOslo airport  but... it looks like that's\nall their points for the day. It'd be pretty funny if they\nwent to the wrong airport again. We need to see how early we can get out of Sandefjord\ntomorrow morning. Because... we gotta get back in the game. There's nothing if we go\nall the way to Oslo. We couldn't get to Oslo\nfast enough  I don't think. Should we go to Oslo...\nFor the morning? Yeah  probably.\nFor the morning. We should probably ride\nall the way up to Oslo now. 'Tis a nice little airport. I'm a fan. We could get— We could be stuck here\nfor a little while  Tom  I'm gonna be honest.\nWhy? Because the inbound\nflights to Tallinn don't look great. We thank you for airBaltic\nand wish you a pleasant flight. Sam  our incoming flight\nis from Tallinn to Vilnius. Uh-huh? It has not yet left Tallinn. Yeech. That's not good. That board up there that said it's only\nfive minutes late? It's a lie. It's a complete lie. Yeech. If that flight's\ndelayed any more... Actually I think we... And we just got delayed\nto 16:00. Norway has the nicest drunks. This guy came up to us \nand he was like  \"My bag is full of drugs. Do you\nguys wanna come to a museum?\" Yeah.\nAnd we were like  no. Well  actually Adam was like  no.\nAnd I was like  maybe. But then Adam was like  no. Alright  Adam. Benjamin... It's time to lock Norway. Oof  in Oslo. A place that we did not think\nwe would be coming today. Yeah.\nThey are still in Vilnius. Which does not seem... right 'cause they've— they're\nstill at the airport. They didn't attempt a challenge. So I don't know why\nthey would've been at the airport for this long. No  I mean  maybe\ntheir options were just really bad. It makes me wonder if\nsomething has gone wrong. Because transparently \nI'm trying to do the math here. And we're up 10–7. Oh  the math is looking\na-good. It's very good. I mean  if they don't\nmake it out tonight  which they would\nneed to leave soon... Yeah. I think that would be that. Alright  we have been\ndoing... math. Yeah. I have looked at a lot\nof flight schedules. We believe that if they lock Norway... ...that might be game over. Yeah  because we\ncan't steal Liechtenstein. We can't get there.\nWe can't get there. There might be a way\nfor us to claim three. I don't know.\nWe think. Steal Oslo...\nand get somewhere else. I'm not sure where\nthat somewhere else would be right now  but... If they  if they win\nthe Norway challenge right now... I think that might be it  Tom.\nI think that might be it. Just for extra clarity \nhere's the basic math. The score right now is 10–7 and the game automatically\nends at 5:30 tomorrow. In order to tie  we need to – by 5:30 tomorrow –\nnet three countries. The trouble is \nin the case of a tie  the team who has claimed\nthe greatest area wins and Ben and Adam have\nlocked enough big countries to guarantee that they'll\nhave the greatest area  which means that actually\nwe need to net four countries. With existing flight schedules  there is only one\ntheoretical way to do this. First of all  we need Ben and Adam\nto get snowed in or something and not claim anything else\nfor the rest of the game. Assuming that happens \nif our flight does leave tonight  we would get to Tallinn \nclaiming Estonia. Then tomorrow we could fly to Norway\nand steal it  netting two more. Then if we were fast enough \nwe could maybe get a flight to one more unclaimed country. We don't know for certain\nif this is even possible  but here's one thing\nwe do know for certain: If they lock Norway  there is no possible\npath to victory for us. Ugh. Hopefully it's\nsomething weird with... (chuckles grimly) Maybe it's eating\nsome of their weird fish stuff or something  you know? You ready? I'm ready. Let's go down there where there's— Let's go  there's like a thing.\nIt's like a whole thing. Oh. You wanna go there? Benjamin... You ready? I feel that if we lock this  I am gonna sort of\nstop being worried. I think that this could\nvery potentially seal their fate. Are you ready?\nLet's take a look. Here is the Norway challenge. Appreciate your surroundings. Appreciate your surroundings. The Norwegian idea of \"kos\" means:\n\"embracing peace and happiness  \"being in the moment \nand fully appreciating the surroundings\nyou find yourself in.\" For this challenge  spend ten minutes silently\nadmiring your surroundings. One of you will write a list of ten things\nin your surroundings  while the other draws\nyour surroundings. All ten of the things\non teammate one's list must be undeniably visible\nin teammate two's drawings. You may attempt this three times \nbut must go to new surroundings (ie. at least half a mile\naway from prior attempts). That's nice.\nThat is nice. Okay  well... We should try and do this\nbefore the sun sets. Yeah  yeah.\nWell  we have an hour. Sam  our flight status\nhas changed. Not on the boards \nnot with any announcements. But instead of 'status: delayed'  it now says 'status: unknown'. Mm  interesting. Actually  I don't see any flight\nthat has left Tallinn anytime recently.\nIt's only inbound flights. So maybe... (laughs) I don't think\nwe're going to Tallinn. Maybe our flight's\ngonna get canceled? That would be bad\nfor our chances  Tom. (cackles profusely) A lot of things are bad for\nour chances at this point. That would be\ndevastating to our chances. Yeah. Well... Our chances  Sam  were\npretty much already devastated. Hello camera.\nHello. We found something\nbeautiful to admire. So Adam is gonna draw this and I am going to name\nten things that I can see. All ten things that I list have to be in\nAdam's... illustration. Yep.\nI think we can do that. Alright buddy \nwe got ten minutes. Ready to start admiring?\nYep. Okay. Alright  I'm gonna\nstart the timer. They've been\non the harbourfront next to the opera house\nfor a little while now. Yep. That's very open\nand very cold. I wonder what they're up to. It's a nice area.\nIt's lovely. I've been there before.\nYeah. Oh  that's nice.\nThey'll have a great camera shot. Great view of... Polar plunge maybe? (chortles) (phone timer ping) That's time  Ben. Okay  no more admiring. Your admiring is finished. Alright  Ben \nwhat did you write down? So my first thing is the hills across the water. Yes  those are the hills. The trees on those hills. Yes  these are\nthe trees on the hills. The water itself.\nYes. The water fowl. Yes  the little birds\nin the water. The little— yes. The sky. Yes  I even wrote\nthe word 'sky' 'cause I was worried that people would think\nI didn't mean to draw the sky. I did a little bit of shading.\nHell yeah. The pillars in the water. Yes  the pillars are here. The cruise ship. Obviously  yes.\nIt's a big one. I actually literally didn't even\nnotice it for a little while 'cause the sun was blocking it. The buildings to the right\nof the cruise ship. Yes  the buildings \nright there. The floating platform \njust to the right over there. Yes  that is right there. And my very last thing  Adam  is the beautiful sunset. And of course there's the wonderful sun setting. Ben... In that case \nthat means that we have locked the great country of Norway. And with it  if they\nhave not yet left Vilnius... I think they might be... I think things might be...\ndonezo. very  very bad for them. And there they are. And they're still\nthere at the airport. Maybe they have a flight out. Let's call them.\nI don't think so. Gentlemen.\nHello  Sam and Tom. Hello.\nHello. We have spent... Oh  can I just say incredible composition\nof the shot there. Oh  thank you.\nPretty looking. Thank you  well... Way better weather\nthere than here. Yeah. And you know  the reason that the shot\nis composed so beautifully is that we've just spent\nthe last ten minutes admiring our scenery. Yes. And I drew...\nAdequately. a beautiful picture of it. And Ben wrote down\nten things that he saw. And wouldn't you believe it? All ten things\nthat Ben wrote down were visible in my picture. We have some other\nnews for you as well. Yeah  what's going on?\nWhich is that... Why are you still in Vilnius? The flight that was meant to\ntake us to Tallinn from here... has just been announced\nthat it is so far delayed that we can no longer take it. It goes too far into\nthe rest period. Ooh. Yeah  there's supposed to be\nalmost a foot of snow in Tallinn today.\nYeah. We are stuck here.\n(giggles) There is no path forward.\nYou have locked Oslo. We cannot get anywhere\nuntil tomorrow morning. We need four points because\nthe tie's broken by area  and you've got that as well. There is no path for four points\nand zero for you tomorrow. That is the game. Well  if y'all want\nto maybe head to London  I think we have\nsomething to give you. Yeah.\nOkay. Alright  gentlemen \nwe will see you in London. Maybe we should all\ntake the teleporter. Teleporter. Teleporter. Okay  fine  Tom. Teleporter.\nWell played. Stand up.\nWell played  yes. Do you know how to do this? Teleporter.\nWell  it depends. Are we doing Star Trek\nor are we doing my kids shows\nfrom when I was a chi— from when I was like... Whichever is the one\nwhere you just jump and then you end up there.\nWe're gonna jump. Kids show teleporter.\nGot it. Okay  you ready?\nReady? Yeah. Alright. Three  two  one. Hey!\nOh  hey guys. We're here.\nWelcome back. Good to see ya.\nWe got our DJUNGELSKOG. Eyyy! He made it too  he made it\nthrough the wormhole. Okay  it was a monkey.\nIt wasn't the bear. It's both.\nIt was. It's both. Okay. It's a monkey or a bear.\nAnd it's also— Or a panda. Right.\nA panda counts as well. Well...\nThat's the game. Unfortunately...\nYou took that. (laughs) There was nothing\nwe could have done there. Yeah. There were several things\nwe could have done earlier  but there was nothing\nwe could have done there. And we learned\nin the wormhole our flight was actually\ncanceled  so... Yes.\nOkay  well... that is tough. It is— It's our job to\ngive you a thing I believe. I believe...\nDo you have them? I do. Well \nI'm actually just gonna— It's gonna kinda\nfloat magically in now. Okay. Oh  there it is. Oh my god.\nWoah! I didn't know\nyou could float things through the air  Tom.\nYep. There we go. We have 33 individual\nsmall trophies  one for each country\nof Schengen. And if you assemble them\nlike a LEGO set... Wait  wait  let me... Yep.\nOh yeah. Ben... Now all you need to do is just\nmove your hands really fast. Just move 'em. (imitates whooshes) And like cartoon animals fighting  we have one massive trophy\nfor season 13. Whoa!\nWhoa!\nThey assembled that really fast. It was really good. Explains how they got\nthe LEGO challenge. Absolutely. Congratulations!\nCongratulations! Thank you.\nThank you. It's been an absolute honour\nto be part of this. It was so much fun.\nThank you so  so much. Thank you for coming\non our show  Tom. Thank you  Tom. We were honored to have you. So despite our\nregularly coming to Europe and riding a lot of trains... Yeah.\nYeah  yeah. And the nice thing about trains\nis that they're not as exhausting. But this time \nyou took a bunch of planes. We did.\nAs well. How are you feeling? Yeah. That has to have some—\nhad some impacts  right? Well  we're professionals.\nWe feel fine. The question for you  Tom \nis how are you feeling? Yeah  I wanna know\nhow Tom is feeling. Honestly... ...jet lagged. (group cheers) Waaa-hoo! He said the thing  Ben. Bye! He said the thing. See you in...\nBye! See you in season 14. Oh my god \nthat's so many numbers. (grunts) Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Alright  let me try... Let's do a test of— Let's both crouch\nin the bush. Three  two... Hello!\nHi. Welcome to\nour secret hiding spot in New York City. I know— I know\nit doesn't look like New York City but that's what makes it\na good hiding spot. We hope. Welcome to\nGrand Central Terminal  the starting point for\nour special one-off game of hide-and-seek\nacross NYC. But right now  it's 12:30. So you know\nwhat that means  Ben. It's time to go  go  go!\nIt's time to go  go  go! Surprise!    Surprise!\nSurprise! Happy birthday.\nHappy birthday. Happy birthday.\nHappy birthday. We got you a one off\nepisode of Jet Lag: The Game where we play hide-and-seek\nin New York City. Just for you.\nThat is true. We wanted to see what\npublic transit in America was like. And we also \nas capitalist fiends  wanted to promote\nour product  the home game. Therefore  we made this whole one-off special. Yeah!\nNot a full season or anything. We have Amy  our colleague. Amy— Amy heads. Yeah.\nAmy— If you watched this season  you know Amy wrote\nthe challenges for the season. And now she's on the game. It's pretty fun. I think it was actually\na really good round. Yeah  it genuinely\nplayed out in a very fun way. It was pretty crazy. Here's what I will say though. That's not enough\nto hold me over for the whole off-season. What if—\nI'm gonna go crazy. What if  Ben...\nWhat if. What if we had this whole\ncomedy debate show? What? Called\nAbolish Everything!. Produced by\nWendover Productions  aka the producers behind\nJet Lag: The Game. What if I told you that you were on\nthe first episode of the show? I didn't know that. What if I told you I was on\nthe second episode of the show? I did know that. Yeah. There's so much going on\nduring this off-season. There's also all sorts of\nother original stuff on Nebula that's come out recently \nand that's coming out soon. It's a big year\nfor Nebula Originals. But how do I watch  Sam? Well  you go to\nwww.nebula.tv/jetlag. Why do I do the \"/jetlag\" part? 'Cause that's our promo code.\nThat gets you 40% off. It gets me 40% off an annual\nsubscription to Nebula.TV? What does that bring\nthe cost to? $36 a year.\n$36 a year? That's only $3 a month. You would be losing money to not do that right now. That's true.\nI'm pretty sure that's the truth. Yeah. Anyway  go to\nnebula.tv/jetlag. Do all the things\nwe just told you to do. Thank you for watching\nthis season. I hope you enjoyed it. Bye!\nSee you next time. Thank you!\nBye!"

        "transcript": "(grunting) Hello  welcome to my\nsecret hiding location. I frankly have no idea\nhow they are going to find me. Good luck! Welcome to\nhide-and-seek across Japan. We're the Seekers \nwe're in Tokyo  and Ben is... Where am I  you ask? That's the whole show. It's hide—\nWe're playing hide-and-seek. And so you don't know\nwhere I am. Welcome to our six-day game\nof hide-and-seek across Japan. The goal of this game is simple:\nHide for as long as you can without being found. Right now  Adam and I are\nstarting in Tokyo as the Seekers  while the first Hider  Ben \nhad three and a half hours to find a hiding spot\nsomewhere else in the country. In order to find him  we'll have to piece together\ninformation about his location using these 62 questions\nin our giant question menu. Ben has to answer these\nquestions truthfully  but in exchange  he'll get to draw cards\nfrom the Hider Deck  giving him big advantages\nlike Time Bonuses or Curses that can slow the Seekers down. Once we find Ben \npositions will rotate  and it will be\nsomeone else's turn to hide. After the end of six days  the player with the longest\nsingle hiding run wins. We'll go over all the\nnitty gritty rules later. For now  Ben's clock is ticking. So Adam and I need to\nfigure out what to ask so we can start moving\nin Ben's direction. Okay. Here is our map.\nYou  the audience  are seeing a digital\nversion of the map. So Sam  the bad news is that\nI think that from Tokyo Station  you can get further in\nthree and a half hours than from any other\nplace in the world. So  I sort of think the\nfirst thing we need to do is make sure that he's not just... somewhere in the\ngreater Tokyo area. Well  I think the one-two punch\nthat we would want is: confirm he's not in\nthe Tokyo metro area  and then we need a direction. Okay  so now that\nwe've got our strategy  we need to start\nasking some questions. In this game  our questions are\nbroken into six simple tools. Matching questions allow us to check\nwhether something about our location is the same or different\nfrom Ben's. Like  is his prefecture\nthe same as ours? Is his nearest major city\nthe same as ours? Things like that. Measuring questions are similar \nbut they allow us to check whether something is closer to\nor further from Ben than it is from us. Like  is he closer\nto a Shinkansen line? That's the bullet train \nby the way. Is he closer to a coastline  etc. The Thermometer – a new tool in this\nversion of hide-and-seek – allows us to ask\nwhether we're getting hotter or colder to Ben's location after we've traveled\na certain distance. The Radar can check\nwhether Ben is or isn't within a certain distance of us  and Photo questions allow us to ask Ben for\na photo of something  like a bridge or the\ntallest mountain he can see. Finally  we've got Tentacles  a new tool for dealing\nwith dense metro areas that we'll get into\nonce it's relevant. The point is  there are\na lot of different ways we can approach this \nbut we've gotta do it quickly. I'm a little bit tempted  Sam \nto plop down a 50-mile Radar. Okay  so 50 miles\ngets us to Odawara. That would be this.\n100 would be a decent bit further. I don't hate 100. I mean  100 for us\nwould confirm that he is... He has definitely Shinkansen'd\nhis way out of here. I... agree with you. Should we hit it?\nOkay. Let's ask if he is\nwithin 100 miles of us. So I'm allowed to wander around\na little bit in my hiding zone. There's a sort of town nearby\nat the bottom of this mountain. So I'm gonna go check that out 'cause when I started\nclimbing up this mountain  I was ignoring all kinds of signs that were translating like\n\"Violent monkeys\"  \"The monkeys will try\nand attack you on sight.\" I'm gonna be honest.\nI have been hearing monkeys. So I think that\nif I stay in here longer  I might be killed by monkeys. Oh  slippery. (hard scraping)\n(grunts) Oh  okay  we've got\nour first question. It is a 100-mile Radar\nfrom Tokyo Station. And let me tell you... That's gonna be a miss. I am not within\n100 miles of Tokyo. So let's go ahead\nand let 'em know. Oh. It's a miss. Okay  so he is not\nwithin 100 miles of us. So we're... Let's measure that and\nmark it on the map. A Radar  which\nthey've just asked  is worth two cards. So that means that I get to look\nat the top two cards of the deck... and draw one of them\ninto my hand. So  the top two cards\nare gonna be... a five-minute bonus\nand a discard two  draw three. Now  the five minute bonus...\nI mean  it is an extra five minutes. But I think ultimately\ndown the line  the discard two  draw three\nis going to be more useful. So we're going to\ngo ahead and keep that. Pretty exciting. Oh  and  I should mention. We're selling this. We've finally designed a\nversion of hide-and-seek that can be played\npretty much anywhere. You can get the Hider Deck\nand all the other goodies you need to play this yourself \nwherever you are in the world. Do I have anything else to say?\nNo  you should do that. You should buy\nthis product  please. Here is what I... kind of think we should do. There are three Shinkansen lines\nthat require going north and one requiring going south. I think we should head up north. And then we can ask\nif we're hotter or colder. And what that would do is... That would successfully\ndraw us a line... that totally cuts off this Shinkansen line\nthat goes sort of west. So we need to start\nthat question now  basically. We'll start it now \nand then we'll go and ask for hotter or colder.\nOkay. I think we should\nhop on a Shinkansen so that if we decide\nwe want to keep going  we're already on the fastest train. This one? We just have to get in\na non-reserved car. Let's go ahead\nand step on it  Sam. Yeah. We've sort of learned\nfrom Ben's mistakes. Little update.\nI hear the monkeys. They're louder.\nI think they're getting closer. I do not want to die\nat the hand of a monkey. I d... I... I know that this may not\nbe politically correct  but I would fight a monkey ...if I had to fight it. Oh  what the (bleep) is that?\nOkay  let's go. (slips  hits ground) Goodbye  Tokyo. Alright.\nJust the station. Goodbye  Tokyo Station. We've gone a half mile.\nCan you text? Yeah. Now we will know which... basically which side\nof this line Ben is on. If we're hotter  right \nthat means we went the right way. He's up here.\nIf we're colder  right... then he went that way. There's a town right down there\non the bottom of the mountain. I'm gonna try and go down there. No  I can't deal with this. Okay  so it looks like\nthey've just used the Thermometer tool\nto go a half-mile north and see if they've\ngotten hotter or colder. And let me tell you... They're hotter. Now they know that\nthey need to go north. So  the moves they're making \nthey make a lot of sense  but they still got\na big area to cover. And let me tell you. The next move that they make\nis going to matter a lot. Oh  Sam.\nHotter. We are hotter. I am really glad because the thing about this map is that... while this might be\nour hotter direction  this is geography's\nhotter direction. Yes  it is\nless dense that way. It's less dense the way we're going. I mean the weather. Oh sure  oh yeah. It's going to be colder\nif we get up there. That's true. Well  we're hotter  which is great. It means we're going\nthe right way. Yeah. Now  I think we'll\ncontinue up to Ōmiya. Then the question will be \ndo we stay on this line  which goes more northwest? Or are we going to\nneed to switch at Ōmiya and get on the Shinkansen\nthat goes northeast? The Niigata line... There's not a whole lot\nin that direction. There's not. Okay  well... Now that I have answered their... Thermometer question... I get to look at\nthe next two cards. We've got: Curse of the\nImpressionable Consumer and Curse of the\nMediocre Travel Agent. Wow  okay  two Curses. So  just really quick \na note on how Curses work. These are cards that Ben can keep in his hand\nand play against us when he thinks they'd be\nmost advantageous. Both of these Curses do\nsomething to slow us down. Curse of the Impressionable Consumer\nforces us to go buy something that we've seen in an advertisement\nbefore we can ask another question. And Curse of the\nMediocre Travel Agent allows Ben to send us off\nto a location of his choice and fetch him a souvenir. These are both quite useful  but they also both\nhave casting costs that level the playing field. The first Curse makes\nour next question free  and the second Curse could\npotentially give away some hugely valuable information \nbecause the place Ben sends us needs to be further from him\nthan our current location. In this game  choosing\nthe right Curses and casting them at the right time\nis a crucial part of Hider strategy. These are both pretty decent. So  the Curse of the\nImpressionable Consumer... basically means that\nthey gotta go out and they gotta find\nan ad for something and they gotta go buy it. That's gonna be really\neasy to do in Tokyo. Curse of the Mediocre Travel Agent basically just means\nthat I can send them a half-mile off on a little\nadventure at any time. So I think that...\nI'm gonna take that one. I think that I can use that\nto maybe screw them on a train later\nor something  yeah. I think that is—\nI think that's the one that I'm gonna keep. He didn't. Oh  he waved back. He waved back.\nHe did? Yeah.\nThat's awesome. Okay  Sam.\nHere is the deal with this. We need to find Ben.\nWell  yes. This is a big decision point. Basically  I would really like\nfor us to figure out which Shinkansen to take without having to actually\ntake one to check. Yeah  you want to see\nhow long it takes to get between Niigata and Sendai? Oh  god. We need to figure out\nhow to slice this map properly. Do we want to just... YOLO it.\nGo to Shin-Shirakawa and ask if we're in\nthe right region? I kinda... I'm not against the idea of\njust going significantly north. But again  but as you said \nif we're in Sendai  and we have to get to Niigata... Well  we're gonna\nhave to backtrack. We'd have to backtrack\nall the way  for sure. There's gotta be a\nbetter question to ask. Okay. We've made it to town. I don't really know what\nthey got going on here  but let's try and figure it out. (water rushing) I don't even know why\nI set up this shot. (hums staccato rhythm) What are they doing? I seem to be correct. I think they have\ngotten off in Ōmiya. So they're going to hit me\nwith a question soon. I don't— I do not know\nwhat it's going to be. But if they cannot figure out\nwhat line to go up... they could be putting themselves\nin a very risky situation. And let me tell you this.\nClock is ticking  boys. You know  for every minute that you can't figure out\nwhat to ask me... that's just more time for me. You know what we should do? I know what we should do. Maybe. If we go this way... we could do a\nhotter-colder here... and then that would\ntotally cut that off. Mmm. I'm just saying. The problem is \nwe have to waste an hour that we will never get back. Right  but we risk\nlosing three hours. Or we can make a judgment call. My opinion is that we\nshould reduce our risk right now. Because it's\nthe one single run that wins it all.\nWell— So it's really bad\nto do high-risk and then be wrong.\nI think I'm fine with that. I'd also be fine with risky \nbut I agree that it is this early good to be risk averse. Okay  yes  text him?\nYeah. Folks  they've started\na Thermometer. Who cares?\nThey don't know what's going on. They're done  okay?\nThere's— They have no clue. I want to address something  okay?\nI need to address something. Before the game started \nAdam was like  \"You should not wear\nthat jumpsuit.\" Because it looks like\nthe flag of Imperial Japan. And... I was trying to do\na Where's Waldo thing  but I do— I feel like I\nneed to go on the record. I do not endorse.... that era of... Japanese governance  okay? I do not like Imperial Japan. Emperor Hirohito  okay \nI'm calling your ass out. You should not'a done\nthat stuff. Wee! Train. Alright.\nAlright. Sam  welcome to...\nHanagawa  I think. A place that is\nfive miles west of Ōmiya. Let's ask Ben if\nwe are hotter or colder. Adam and Sam have\nfinished their Thermometer. I'm afraid... It's colder.\nThey did not go the right way. Which is to say \nam I off of the Niigata line? No  I'm not. I'm off of a different line. You still got a lot\nof map left to look. So... Sorry! Alright.\nYou wanna see the answer? Yeah. Okay. Well...\nSo he's colder. What does that mean  Adam? Well  it means that\nwe probably should have gotten on that other train. But it's good—\nI told you— I'm just kidding. It's good that we checked. It is good that we checked.\nNow we know. Now we know. So now we should just go back\nand do the other thing. I just want to record\nthe clip now for later  where I say \n\"I feel like Ben is here.\" Look  if Ben is there... that's gonna really suck for us. Yeah  the one flaw\nwith this plan is there are places where\nthe fastest way to get them is through Niigata.\nYeah. But are on the\nother side of our line because we just couldn't\nget a perfect angle. And that would be... I wouldn't love it. For the audience's perspective \nit would be hilarious. It would be very funny. Alright.\nShall we get back on our train? Yeah. Let's run it back. Let's see what we got here. Ooh  it's another Curse.\nOh my goodness. Curse of the Ransom Note. Curse of the Ransom Note. The next question\nthat the Seekers ask must be composed of\nwords and letters cut out of any printed material. Casting cost: Spell out\n\"Curse of the Ransom Note\" as a ransom note. Or a 10 minute bonus. I mean  10 guaranteed minutes.\nThat's not nothing. There are a lot of Curses that probably cannot\ntake 10 minutes. This is a tough one. I'm gonna take\nCurse of the Ransom Note for now. I might discard it later because it's not\na very powerful one. But  I guess it's better to just have  if I need it  rather than a 10 minute bonus.\nSo I'm going to take the Curse. Either way  it's both\npretty good options  and... We're doing good.\nWe're doing good  okay? Don't worry. Okay  so  this is our map. But the good news is  that with the\n3 ½ hours that he had  he could not have gotten\nto the island of Hokkaido. So we can eliminate that. Meaning that he's\nsomewhere... on here. Okay  so we have a pretty good transfer onto the fastest Shinkansen up to Sendai.\nYeah. That gets us kind of in\nthe center of what is left. Yeah.\nAnd Sendai is a big hub. Yeah. So I think that seems right.\nI agree. One thing I think we\nshould do now though  is I would like to request\na picture from Ben. It takes 15 minutes\nfor him to answer. Yeah. So it's good\nfor us to do it now while we aren't doing anything. Is he in a denser place?\nIs he in a really rural place? Yeah. Knowing that\nmight be kind of useful. There's a few interesting\npictures we could request. We probably\nwant the ones that... have the highest likelihood of\njust bleedover info  basically. Yeah. I think\nthat we should do... five buildings.\nYeah. Which has to include\nthe bottom and up to four stories. That's going to give us \nif you're in a rural place  you're going to show us quite a bit.\nYeah. I think I like five buildings.\nOkay. Request photo of five buildings? Sure.\nAlright. I will let him know. Let's make Ben work.\nYeah. It looks like Sam and Adam are heading back to Ōmiya Station. Which makes sense. They are probably gonna\ngo get on the Shinkansen. Ooh  okay.\nThey've asked me a Photo question. They want a photo of five buildings. See  the thing is  I really \nto the best of my ability... want to avoid showing mountains. Because that's gonna give\nthem a lot of information. I think there's a view. If I just make sure that\nI crop it below there where you can't see the mountains. Or maybe this way. Okay  yeah  I think there's\ndefinitely an angle here where if you just  you're\npointed away from the mountains  you can go boom  boom \nboom  boom  boom. I think I can make this work. So I'm gonna go ahead\nand take this picture and... send it over to them. (clicks) Alright  welcome  back\nto Ōmiya  Sam. Ben has sent us a picture\nof five buildings. Yeah  we have a\nrelatively quick transfer. So let's just get on the train\nand then analyze it  maybe? Yeah.\nBut  quick reaction is small. Train. Twaaain! This train's\nabout to go real fast. It's gonna go so fast  Adam. It's sort of one of\nthe fastest trains around. I don't think you understand\nhow fast this train's about to go. Okay  Sam. Let's take a look at the picture ...that Ben sent us. It's giving... town. There are multiple people\nout and about. You know the one\nthing I'm noticing? This. Yeah. Kind of looks like\na tourist shop. It...\n'Cause... Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised if he\nwent somewhere modestly touristy because it has\na really cool thing. Yeah  if I were Ben \nwhat I would do to find the location would be like  prettiest\nsmall towns in Japan. You know... We're almost three hours in and we haven't been hit\nby a single Curse yet. It is somewhat frightening. He's probably saving up. Yeah. Okay. So I provided them their photo which means that I get\nto draw another card. Since it's just a photo  I don't get to look at\nthe top cards or anything. I just have to draw\none from the top  and that's the card I get  so... Curse of the Jammed Door. Curse of the Jammed Door. For the next three hours \nthe Seekers must roll dice to pass through a doorway. Casting cost: Discard a card. That's a pretty fun one. I'm not sure where\nthat'll be most useful. But I'll hold on to it. I got quite\nan arsenal cookin'. The train is going very fast. The train is going\nreally fast. Wild  premature guess  but... I do know from research... that this coast... is quite touristy. Mm  okay. Well  let me just throw\nsomething out there. If we wanted to... we could ask him to send a picture\nof his biggest body of water. And if he is on the coast \nthat'd be a huge hit. I mean... Interpreting quite a lot\nfrom quite little  but... coastal town... you're gonna want\nan ice cream vendor. I know  that's what I think. You want to do it?\nYeah. Okay. Here's your photo. Alright  you send it.\nGo for it. Oh! Okay  they've asked me for a photo\nof my largest body of water. I am almost certain\nthat it is this... this river here. Let's go take a photo of the river. I don't know what they're\ntrying to do with that  but... Maybe they're trying to... figure out if I'm\nright on the ocean? The name of the game... is just to take a picture with as little extra\ninformation as I can. Okay. I think I can get\na good pic here that really doesn't say\na whole lot. That doesn't say much. No. That is a—\nThat's a river. Yeah. Okay  well that's useless. Alright  well  there's\nanother picture for them. Does mean I get to\ndraw another card. Alright  hopefully \nI got something good. Let's see. Oh! It's another Curse! Curse of the Lemon Phylactery. Before asking another question \nthe Seekers must each find a lemon and affix it to the outermost layer\nof their clothes or skin. Casting cost: Discard a Powerup. I do like this Curse. I wanna put it on 'em.\nI wanna hit 'em with it. You know  I wanna hit 'em with it. I think that there's\na very good chance that... this will slow them down\nand annoy them greatly. And honestly  if they're on\nthe Shinkansen right now  and I put this on them  it means that they're\nnot going to be able to ask me another question\nuntil they get off the train and go deal with this. So  I am gonna... I'm gonna cast it. Now  the only problem is that in order to cast it  I have to discard a Powerup \nmeaning I have to discard my discard two  draw three.\nThat's fine. I'm going to go ahead and\nplay that on them now. We got a photo.\nWe received a photo. It's a Curse. Nngh-kay.\nWell  I tell you what. This means we can't do the thing\nwhere we ask a question while we're still on the train.\nTrue. That is smart.\nI have to give him that. You  I think  are\na very experienced... affixing items to your body player. Well  we both have to do this. Oh  yeah  sure. Okay  fine. Yeah. Damn. Okay  so while Sam and Adam deal with strapping\nlemons to their bodies... I'm gonna go find some food. It seems like there's\na couple restaurants in this little town  so \nlet's see what there is to eat. So  hello. Do you want to know\nwhere I am? It turns out that this whole time \nI have been hiding... in The Snack Zone. Today on The Snack Zone \nwe are going to be eating... uhhhh... Boo  whoa. Uhm... That tastes the way that being shot in the eye\nwith a laser feels. Not only are we out here... enjoying this thing... But we're also  we're\ncooking up some plans. Because I've still got three Curses in my hand. So we've got\nCurse of the Ransom Note. Makes them ask their next question\nas a ransom note. Curse of the Jammed Door. Prevents them from\ngetting into buildings. Curse of the Mediocre Travel Agent. Sends them somewhere\nthey don't want to go when they don't want to go there. It looks like they're\ntaking the train all the way up to Sendai. They're gonna get off\nthe train in Sendai. Once they get off\nthe train in Sendai  they're going to have to\nattach lemons to themselves. So they're going to\nleave the train station. Then  boom. You hit them with\nCurse of the Jammed Door. Hopefully  you lock them\nout of the train station. Maybe they'll just be able to get\nright back in the train station  but hopefully you can\nat least delay them getting back in\nthe train station. Then... Here's where it gets good. Then  if we can identify\nwhat train they want to get on... out of the station... that's when we hit them with\nCurse of the Mediocre Travel Agent. We wait until that train\nis about to leave  send them right back\nout of the station. I think that if I play my Curses\nat the right time in Sendai  I can trap them there\nfor quite a while. And hopefully prevent them\nfrom gaining any more information for a while  so... Sam  welcome to Sendai.\nDo you feel that? It's not as hot. It's a reasonable\ntemperature here! This rules!\nThank you  Ben! You ready to go find a lemon? Yeah  let's go find a lemon. (sighs)\nAlright  it looks like Sam and Adam\nhave made it to Sendai. And they're probably\nout looking for lemons. As soon as they get\nthose lemons attached  I am going to hit them\nwith the Jammed Door Curse. My hope is that it's going to make getting back into the train station\na huge pain. Unless they could find\nlemons in the train station  which would be bad. Whoa! Are there lemons here? There are oranges. Unfortunately  those are oranges.\nOranges  but no lemons. Oh  that's brutal! Well  the other thing is\nwe have to go to more of a general store\nanyway to get tape. True. Oh  that weather is amazing.\nOh  wow  this is incredible. Alright  Sam  so... The key here is we really\nneed to attach these robustly. Because if they fall off \nit's an hour penalty. My thinking? Here. No  I disagree with that.\nWhat? Your arms are moving\nall around all the time. Well  yeah  but \nthis is the thing you're going to pay\nmost attention to. It's small.\nI think we can get a really good  strong fix. Okay. You want it—\nI think that way is better. (tape squeaking) Whoa  go slow and clean.\nOkay  okay. Methodical. (tape squeaking) Oh yeah  that's not going anywhere. Oh  you have hair in your arms. It's gonna suck more\nat the end for you. Yeah. You gotta do the crisscross. Yeah  no  I totally am\nwith you on the crisscross. (chuckles)\n(tape squeaking) Yeah  no  that's quite secure.\nHow long is it? It's an hour. Easy. No-no-no. No  it's just  it's at any point. Oh wait  really? We have to keep it\nfor the rest— until we find Ben.\nI didn't realize that. Yeah.\nOkay  well. (bleep) Alright. Well  it looks like they've got their\nlemons attached  so... I'm going to hit them with\nthe Curse of the Jammed Door. I don't know if that's going\nto really do a whole lot  but it should at least\nslow 'em down a little bit. So now I think\nthat we want to ask a Matching question. And we have been\ntalking on the train. I think we want to do\nnearest Shinkansen line. Great idea. However... We are once again Cursed. Wait  really? Curse of the Jammed Door. For the next three hours  whenever the Seekers want\nto pass through a doorway into a building  business \ntrain  or other vehicle  they must first roll two dice. If they do not roll seven or higher \nthey cannot enter that space. Any given doorway can be\nreattempted after 15 minutes. Three hours!? Jesus! I'm starting a timer now.\nYeah. That's a lot \nthat's many hours. We can still ask our question.\nYes. Which is  if\nhis nearest Shinkansen is the same as our\nnearest Shinkansen. So ours is this big green one. If the answer is yes \nit's like  okay  yeah  he's in this area that we're in. If the answer is no \nI would say that that is bad news. And  means that he's\neither closest to this one  or he's in the hell area\nwhere he actually is over here. I think he's in the hell area. (sighs) It's possible. It'd be funniest.\nI mean  that seems like the kind of thing we'd\nwrite in the script. So let's ask him that. The next train to where I am leaves their station pretty soon. Oh... okay. Okay  so they just asked me if their closest Shinkansen\nis the same as theirs or not. Now  it's not  because... I am closer to the line\nthat goes up to Yamagata. That's gonna tell them\na lot of information. And I think it's going to tell them\nto get on the train out of Sendai that I don't want them to get on.\nThat train leaves... in about 15 minutes  so... I think that what I'm\ngoing to do now... is I'm going to send\nthem on a little... send them on a little vacation. And if I can time that\nquick enough... I should hopefully get\nthem to miss that train. The answer is no. (bleep)\nWhich is a bit of a curveball. (bleep)  okay. Okay. Well  hey  it's good\nwe know that! It is? I mean... (bleep) All signs point to\nhe's on that purple line. I mean  the thing is \nwe can get to that line in an hour. Yeah  it's not so bad. Okay  for what it's worth... Oh  we got another one. (sighs) Oh  god. Curse of the\nMediocre Travel Agent. The Seekers must go to the\nHider's chosen location  spend at least 10 minutes there \nand acquire a souvenir before asking another question. The location must be further\nfrom the Seekers than the Hider. What I was literally\nabout to mention was that the next train\nacross to the purple line leaves in ten minutes. (wheezes) Great.\nWell  let's get walking. Yeah  okay  well...\nAwesome. Okay  so now that I've answered\nthat Shinkansen question  it does mean that I get\nto look at the top three and draw another one. So  hopefully I get\nsomething good in here. Okay. Ten minute bonus. Curse of the Distant Cuisine. Curse of the Distant Cuisine. Find a restaurant within your zone\nthat explicitly serves food from a specific foreign country. The seekers must visit a restaurant\nserving food from a country that is equal or\ngreater distance away before asking another question. And Curse of the Drained Brain. Curse of the Drained Brain. Choose three questions\nin different categories. The seekers cannot\nask those questions for the rest of your run. Casting cost: Discard your hand. I don't know what to do. Okay. So I've been—\nOkay  so  between these three... 10 minute bonus \nit's just not that big of a bonus. Curse of the Distant Cuisine  it's gonna give them\ntoo much information. I don't want to tell them about\nany restaurants that are here. Curse the Drained Brain  I do think I could use\nthis in the endgame. Because I do think that\nI can eliminate three questions that would be really useful once they actually get here. Alright  we're\nalmost at the stupid park. Why are you already\nbadmouthing the park? No  I'm sure\nthe park will be nice. Alright Sam  we have to\nenjoy a ten-minute vacation and find a souvenir. Wheeeeee! Whee! Whee! Whee! Look. I am not making this up. The monkeys are dastardly. So  I've been looking\nfor hiding spots for a little while now. I haven't really found\nanything perfect  but there are a lot\nof these really... amazing temples here.\nThey're really something. I mean  how cool is that? It's just  I think this whole\narea where I am right now with all these amazing temples \nit's like too obvious  you know? I think that...\nthis is why people come here. So I need to find something... really off the beaten path. Something that\nthey're not going to just immediately\nsort of gravitate to. I think I'm going to keep looking. Oh! Oh!\nAwh! Okay  should we\nlook for a souvenir? The thing is  there's\nso little litter here. Yeah  there's not a lot here. I mean  we could bring\nhim a wonderful leaf. There's a little rock.\nThat is a rock. You know  that's a nice gift. Here's a bigger rock.\nIt does have a better shape. I do agree that this\nis a better rock. Alright  I think\nwe can do this rock. So  the second\nthat our timer is done  we want to hit him with the... with the Radar  right?\nWhich one? Yeah  what are you doing?\nThe 50 mile Radar— Peeling. You're gonna eat it?\nI was peeling it for you. Oh  okay.\nWell  that's an interesting choice. So we want to hit him\nwith the 50 mile Radar as soon as we're done  right? I believe yes. Well  the nice thing is \ngiven how much we've eliminated  if we hit him with\nthe 50 mile Radar  and it's a hit  then that's actually\na pretty small area. And we probably\nwant to take that line over to that line.\nYeah  probably. Oh  god. I knew it was going\nto be really sour. But it was a lot more\nsour than I thought. Oh  jeez. Alright  well  our time is up. Alright  hit him\nwith the radar quickly before he can Curse us again.\nAlright  alright  alright  alright. Let's— Okay.\nLet's go back to the station. Tell you what \nmy lemon is itchin'. Okay  so they've just\nhit me with a 50 mile Radar. So before I answer that  I'm gonna hit him with the\nCurse the Drained Brain. Because my hand is empty right now. So I basically don't\nhave to pay for this. It's kind of the\nperfect time to play it. So I'm going to get rid of photo of the tallest building\nfrom my train station  the train service question  where they can see if their train\nwould stop at my station. Both of those are really\ngoing to help them figure out exactly what my station is \nwhich I don't want them to do. And then I'm also\ngoing to get rid of the quarter mile Radar  because it's very useful\nin the endgame. So  those three\nthey cannot... now ask. ♪ I was waiting for love ♪ Oh  Ben. What? Curse of the Drained Brain. The Seekers cannot\nask three questions of the Hider's choice\nfor the rest of the run. He has banned three\nvery useful questions. For how long?\nFor the rest of the run?! Yeah.\nWho wrote that question? It's tough. But the 50 mile Radar\nwas a hit. I am within 50 miles of them. So they've got the map\nquite small now  which really emphasizes\nto me that... I've gotta find a hiding spot. Ooh  it's a hit.\nOkay  that's good news. Okay  so we probably want to\njump over to that line then  right? Yeah  probably. The good news is we have him in a not that huge area. Probably. Now that I've\nanswered their Radar  I do get to at least look\nat the top two and draw one. Ugh  give me something\ngood  please. Okay.\nCurse of the Unguided Tourist. Curse of the Unguided Tourist. Send the seekers an unzoomed\nGoogle Street View image from a street within 500 feet\nof where they are now. Without using\nthe internet for research  they must find what you\nsent them in real life before they can use transportation\nor ask another question. And a discard two  draw three. So Curse of the Unguided Tourist  that could be useful to\nbasically prevent them from getting on a train again. Discard two  draw three. I just don't think\nthat's going to be that useful to me now  so... I'm going to keep this Curse \nand hopefully... it can come in handy later. Okay  Sam.\nSo this is the entrance. Do you have it zoomed in\nso we'll be able to see it? I would hold it  I would maybe—\nThis square. This square?\nYep. Nice job  Adam. We can go in.\nThat's not the last hurdle. We can go in. We don't know if we can\nget on the train yet  but we can go in the station\nand roll for the train. I found a giant bowl of soup. I don't know why it's here  but... maybe I could hide in\nthe giant bowl of soup. What are Sam and Adam up to? Are they going on a train? Are they coming for me? Which platform was it? Was it three or four?\nSeven. To Yamagata  that's us?\nBelieve so. Okay  then\nI need to roll the dice. Alright. Alright. That's bad.\nThat's brutal. Well... We've got more time to\nformulate a strategy. It kinda looks like\nthey're not on the train. No. They're still in Sendai. Which either means that they\nhave not yet figured out the line that they need to go on... I mean  I guess the other option is that maybe the\nCurse of the Jammed Door locked them out of the train. That'd be pretty... That'd be pretty... Pretty spicy. (giggles) That's brutal. Wow  this is really brutal. We need to figure out\nwhat the (bleep) to do here. Huh? We need to figure out\nwhat to do. Here's what I think\nwe should do  Sam. While we have all this time... We could ask for a Strava map\nwith the six turns and we could try matching\nit to all the places. I was going to\nmention Strava map. We know Strava map is useful. Yeah  okay. Look. Ben has gifted us with time. Let's use it. Okay  so just to be clear \nwhat we're going to ask for is... he has to walk\na half-mile on Strava and make six turns\nand then send us a picture of that outline.\nYeah. And then we're going\nto try to match it... Let's do it.\nto the streets on the map. Okay.\nShall I text? Yeah  go for it. I feel like I'm already\nkinda out of the way out here. But I'm gonna keep looking around. I know that it might seem obvious\nthat I should just go back... up the mountain where\nthe monkeys are. But it's... not that hard to find that place.\nThere are not that many paths. It doesn't really\nbranch off all that much. I actually don't think it would be\nthat hard for them to find me if I went up that mountain. Look  it sounds like copium. It sounds like I'm\nscared of the monkeys. I gotta be honest \nI'm scared as hell of the monkeys. Oh  I'm so scared of\nthose monkeys  man. But I do think that\nI can find a perfect spot. I can find a place that\nthey're just not gonna go. Strava map? Really? Okay. They are going to\ntry and match it up. And I guess there probably just aren't that many\nspots remaining... that they could check. And so this is going to be\na decent way of confirming  but... We'll see. While we wait  Adam  I'm looking into the\nkind of furthest extent he could have gotten\nin his time yesterday. Yeah. So he started at 3 pm  and he had to be in\nhis spot by 6:30 pm. Yeah.\nSo theoretically... he could have taken\nthis 3 pm Shinkansen  but that terminated in Yamagata. At what time?\n5:46. So  he would have\nonly had 45 minutes. So  this is really useful. So  he needs somewhere within a 45 minute\nradius of Yamagata. Well  let me see.\nSo  like  so  Shinjō... He could not\nhave gotten to Shinjō. Could he have gotten to\nany of the stops before Shinjō? Yes  he could have gotten... as far as Higashine. Higashine  yeah  I see that. So  eliminate everything north. Yeah  so that's good.\nSo this is great. So we can exclude...\nIf you're right... we can exclude all of this. So that means then  Sam \nit's actually very limited. He could be on this\npart of this line that we're about to go on. He could be on these—\nthis Shinkansen. He could be on this line \nor he could be a little down here. But that's not a lot.\nNo  I mean... That's quite limited. This is gonna help our\nStrava searching  I think. Yeah. I think that with the Strava \nwe might be able to lock it in. Okay. We're walking. We are walking. You know how we be. Ugh. I should have eaten something\nother than that melon thing. We've come back to\nthe end of the platform because we're about to\nget the Strava answer. Let's make sure that we\nhave looked at all the lines because the transfers\ncould exclude stuff that is unintuitive.\nYeah. What about the line that\ngoes up from Yonezawa? Okay  no. So he couldn't have\ntaken that line either. So this line out of Yamagata \nthe transfer was after 6:30. Okay. So that's eliminated. So I actually think he has to be\neither on the Shinkansen or on the line\nwe're about to take. Yeah. These are looking strong for—\nThis is going better for us than we thought it was  honestly.\nAlmost uncomfortably so. I actually think\nhe is going to be on the line we're about to take. Because I don't think he\nwould do a Shinkansen stop. It is— It would be weird\nto do a Shinkansen  but... these towns are just like nothing. I don't know  Sam.\nI mean  Yamadera? That's exactly what\nI'm looking at  actually. Because it has a lot\nof tourist shops. It has stuff.\nIt's definitely touristy. I mean  I like\nthe sound of Yamadera. ♪ Walkin' ♪ Well  that is Strava done. Oof  alright  well  means\nI get to draw another card. Oof  okay. Discard two  draw three. Not really that useful right now. Maybe later. Okay  he has sent\nthe Strava map. That's an interesting shape. No  I mean  this Strava\nshape definitely changes my thinking about this line. Oku-Nikkawa? Doesn't match that at all.\nHe's not in Takase. Let's check Yama—Yama\nwhatever the (bleep). Oh  yeah.\nYes  that's it. Oh  yeah.\nThat's it. You see that? Oh  yeah! That is it.\nYamadera  yeah. Benjamin Doyle! I believe that Benjamin Doyle\nis at Yamadera station. Your goose is cooked!\nWe've cooked your goose  Ben! Alright  well  back to\nlooking for a hiding spot. Just gonna keep looking. And as soon as they\nstart heading this way... I'll just have to pick.\nOkay  so  we know where he is. Yes.\nIt's a very small town. Well  let's say we believe\nwe know where he is. We know where he is. Adam  explain to me what your... emotional wellbeing is gonna be like\nif we are not allowed on this train and have to wait on this platform\nfor another hour. It's not gonna be good. And the thing is  there's a really\nreal chance that it happens. Yeah.\nAn almost 50% chance. Yeah  and it'd be funny  so...\nWell  yeah. It'll be nice to\ntake these lemons off. I gotta tell you. I'm not feeling good\nabout this dice roll. No  no  me neither.\nNot at all. No.\nDo you want to do it? I think you should do it.\nThat way we can blame it on you. Here it is  yeah. You ready? The doors are here. So nice up here. It's like I got hit with\na wave of tranquility. I think that this is a museum. Oh! I think it's a Bashō Museum. The famed poet. Oh. Wait  now that I'm Bashō \nI'm gonna write a haiku. Writing poetry is hard. Come on  come on  come on. Oh my god. Well. When's the next one? It's another hour.\nHey  but good news  Adam. The Curse will\nbe over by then? I think so.\nAwesome. You wanna go look around?\nYeah. Got another hour. Here's an option. This bridge here is\npretty out of the way. I've gone sort of down\nthe road randomly. I have never— I have\nnot seen this bridge in all the time that I've been here. That's kind of tranquil. Nah  I'm gonna keep going.\nI'm gonna keep going. What are Sam and Adam up to? They should be on a\ntrain heading my way now. Oh my god  they're still in Sendai. They must have rolled bad again. Oh my god. (chuckles) Oh my god. Oh  I'm so sorry. That is brutal. Okay  well... I think I might go\nget some food then. I bought you a sweet treat.\nOh  thank you. It's very thoughtful.\nLet's go outside and try it. Welcome to this episode of\nChoo Choo Chew Derailed. Welcome to The Snack Zone!\nNo. Today  we're trying these\nseemingly mochi coated strawberries. I guess. Four dollars. I mean  that is luxurious.\nMmm. Ooh  things could\nnot be going better! I do not know exactly\nwhat this is. Ooh. Ooh. Oh  that's delightful. Oh! Alright  let's finally\ntake our stupid train. Yeah  our Curse clears with three minutes to spare  right?\nYeah. We're pretty lucky\nwith the timing. Can you believe it  Sam?\nWe're finally leaving Sendai. It's been.... I think  four hours?\n♪ It's been ♪ Huh? You know \nin that song  \"One Week\"? ♪ It's been ♪ Alright  well  it looks like\nSam and Adam are on the move and they're heading towards me. Given how long they've\nhad with that Strava map  I've gotta just assume the worst. And assume that they\nknow exactly where I am and that they're\ncoming straight for me. So here's the situation. I've been scouring\nevery inch of my zone. It is tempting to want\nto go into the woods  but there are kinda\nthree different trails that I could take.\nThere's this one... But in order to get up there \nyou gotta go through this temple  and that closes soon \nso I can't do that. It's the same situation\nwith this one. This is where I started the day  but you gotta go through\nthe cemetery to get there. The cemetery also\ndoes seem to close. I went up here... to the trail by the Bashō Museum. But that just seemed to be... The trails seem to be closed  so... I think that I kind of\nhave no choice but to hide somewhere in town. So  I've got about an hour before they get to me. I'm gonna scope out\nthe rest of town and just see if I can find a really good nook to hide in. Hopefully  I can buy myself\nsome more time when they get here. Yeah  we're getting\ninto the mountains now  so it'll be more scenic. Okay. Hello. I think that I may have\nfound my hiding spot. I'm right here at\nthe edge of my zone. There's this bridge right here.\nRight under there. And  well  I mean  first of all  this looks cool as hell.\nBut also  bridges. All of these bridges that\nI've seen in this zone look pretty much identical. And so  if they use photos to determine that\nI'm under a bridge  it's actually probably not\ngoing to be that helpful. Because there are\nquite a few bridges. And if they're checking\nall of them  this is going to be one of\nthe last ones that they check. So I think that there's\na very good chance that that will buy me\na bunch of extra time. Let's go down there\nand scope it out. Yeah. Oh  I kind of love this. I think this might be my spot. I think I'm just going\nto post up here for now. If they get off my station \nand the endgame starts  then... good luck finding me. Gotta hope that I can buy\nmyself some extra time. Okay  this is nice. Looks like a good spot. Alright  Adam. Yeah?\nWe are going to arrive in... six minutes. So we need to decide when\nwe're getting him with what. Yes. I think the second we get there  we need a picture approximately\nof his hiding location. Because the worst case scenario is\nhe gets us with some Curse. And we need the ability to\njust search without a Curse. The three smart options\nare photo of him  photo straight up  photo of the tallest\nthing he can see. If he's in the woods \nhe's in the woods. All the pictures will\nshow the same thing  except for maybe the tallest thing \nbecause maybe he can see the shrine from the woods.\nYeah. And then we can figure out\nwhat angle he's looking at it from. Yeah.\nSo I think we go with that. Yeah. Okay  let's try tallest structure. What are the odds that\nwe're just completely wrong? Not zero. Whew. Alright. Well  it looks like Sam\nand Adam are almost here. Seeing as they haven't really\nasked any more questions  I figure that they're probably... they've probably figured\nout that I'm here. So  I think they're\ngonna be here momentarily and start searching for me.\nBut you know what? I'm in my lane. I'm flourishing. I got my Curses.\nI got my tracker. I got my snake. Oh my god  it moved.\nOh my god  no. Alright  let's hope this is it. Let's do it in\nfive... four... three... two... one....\nWe have everything? Okay.\nHit it. Wow  the weather\nhere is amazing. Yeah  I think we might\nbe going up some stairs. Yeah  now if\nyou look in Google  it's like the famous\n1 000 steps of wherever the (bleep)\nor something. Oh  yeah.\nYeah  he's up there for sure. Oh  yeah. Oh  yeah. For sure. Well  it would seem that... they've arrived.\nAnd the endgame has begun. They immediately went ahead\nand asked for a photo of the tallest building I can see. And  the tallest building I can see is this bridge  so... There you go. I'm gonna send them\nthe photo of the bridge in a minute. I guess that'll\ntell them something. But not that much. Oh  this is it. This is it. This sign was in it. Yeah  wait  here \nlet me pull it up. Sam. Yep. Alright  well  at least we\nknow we're in the right place. Alright  are these the stairs? I mean  I have to believe\nthat he's up the stupid stairs. We should at least\nstart climbing the stairs. Yeah  we should\nstart going up them. He'll send his picture soon. Honestly  the very\nbig-brain move by Ben would be to not hide.\nYeah. 'Cause this is like  you know \nimmediately you think  oh  he's going to be up there. And then we walk\nall the way up there  and it's like  Ben's not here. They're going up to\nthe temple. They're going— This is  in fact \nexactly what I predicted  is that the thing that\nthis place is known for... which I can say it now \nYamadera. The thing that Yamadera\nis known for is the awesome temple they have at the\ntop of the mountain. And it seems like\nSam and Adam went right to the base\nof that big long path. Alright  let's go ahead and\nsend them a photo of the bridge. And that will probably narrow down their\nsearch quite a bit. Unless they can't tell\nthat it's a bridge. Yeah  it's not a bad idea.\nOkay  he's under the bridge. He's definitely under the bridge.\n(rasps) Okay  let's go check the bridge. Okay  let's go.\nThere's that bridge. Yeah  that one\nactually doesn't look right. It doesn't look right.\nBecause this is concrete. Yeah.\nHe's definitely at the river. Yeah  well  he\ncould be underneath maybe that underpass.\nNo  there's water. He could also be on this side. Well  let's just go\ndown to the bridge. I bet Adam really wants to\nmake the catch happen soon. Well  I want it\nto either happen soon or in a really long time. But probably soon. I get to draw another card. Let's hope it's a good one. Curse of the Cairn. Curse of the Cairn. You have one attempt to stack as many rocks\non top of each other as you can in\na freestanding tower. Once your tower falls  the Seekers must\nconstruct a rock tower of the same number of rocks\nbefore asking another question. Okay... I mean  I do have rocks here  but not really the\nkinda rocks that I need. So actually I think\nwhat I'm gonna do is... I'm gonna discard... these two Curses because they're basically\nuseless at this point. And I'm just going to draw three. And my goal at this point is just to draw into as\nmany Time Bonuses as I can unless I can get a Curse\nthat I can play here. But there are sort of\nlimited instances of those. Okay. A randomized question. A— Ohh-ooh! A 30 minute bonus! So that's pretty good. And a 10 minute bonus  not bad.\nThat's exactly what I wanted to see. I don't know how useful the randomized question\nthing is going to be  but... It's not going to hurt.\nI might be able to use it. I'm feeling pretty good. Let's see what they're up to. We might have just\nwalked right over Ben. So it's not that bridge. Well  unless this side\nlooks different. Let's get on the bridge and then we'll be able\nto see up and down. Okay. Yeah  so... Under here is brick. Yeah. So it's not that.\nIt's not that. It doesn't feel like it's that \nbecause it's like a flat wall. I mean  there's\na bridge down there. Perhaps Sam and Adam\nwill not fall into the same trap... as last time  but... The last time in hide-and-seek \nas you remember  I hid under a slide. In retrospect  I really\nshould have picked a spot that I was willing\nto actually stay in for more than five minutes. And... that was\nvery intentional because I knew that they would\nask me to send a picture. And they'd  you know... It would be very clear\nthat I was under a slide. And so instead of\nasking more questions and narrowing down the area  they just spent way too long trying to find this slide. Which is just a huge waste of time. But I do think that\nSam and Adam... They kinda lock in. And so if they think they\nhave enough to go off of  they're just gonna go off of that  and they're not gonna\nask excess questions. But honestly... They shouldn't do that.\nThey should just ask more questions. This is mostly a Sam thing. Adam might be arguing\nwith him about this. Let's just check the map\nto see where all the bridges are. Just trying to see... Do we want to confirm\nthat he is on the river? I mean  we see water.\nI guess you're right. Because we could ask a\nquestion confirming it. What? We could compare\nour distance to a river. I mean  we see water. I feel like there's\nprobably something. I mean  really  we just\nneed to go that way or we go this way. Okay.\nI feel like. Which one do we\nthink is more likely? I slightly think this way. See  I kind of disagree. There's that highway looking thing made of concrete this way.\nOkay. I feel like the thing\ndown there is not going to be like a road. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. They're coming my way.\nNo  go check other bridges. Go check other bridges.\nDon't come this way. Go check the bridges\non the other side. Go— Oh  no  go away. Look  the river\ngets all narrow here. It splits into two.\nLike this bridge. I wonder if he's under this. No  it's the wrong material.\nUh-oh. Nope. They're going\nthe wrong way. They're going to check\nthe wrong bridge again. They're going to check\nthe wrong bridge again. No  yeah. I mean  it seems like\nthe most likely candidate is the one downstream.\nOkay. And there's no other\nbridges this way? Not that I can tell\nwithin the zone. This is what I'm saying.\nIt's just like... I feel like it would be\neasier and faster to just ask me another question. You know \nmaybe I draw a good card. But probably I just draw\nsome dumb bull-(bleep) that's not even gonna help me. Instead  you're out here\nchecking all the bridges on the Tachiya River. The other side's\nnot the right material. That's not promising. Yeah  it's the wrong material. There's another\nbridge further down. Oh  come on  Ben. This seems to be\nthe last option. At least the material's right. No  it's brick\nagain on the other end. What the (bleep) I think we just\nhave to keep going down. Well  no  that's too far.\nThat's too far? Yeah  there's definitely\nnot another one in this way. I think... I'm not sure we got this one.\nThat's just... That's on the other branch.\nOh my god. It's completely on the other end?\nYeah. That blows. I mean  do we want to... I think at this point \nwe might need to ask a question. Well  here's what we can do. We could ask a half-mile\nRadar from here  which would basically\ninclude half of the area because we're on the edge.\nI guess we might as well because we're not worried\nabout more Curses  right? Not really.\nYeah. I mean  there's not much cost. Okay. Oh  yep. And there they go.\nThere they go. They just asked for\na half-mile Radar. And it's like... Look  you guys. You're gonna have to ask\nmore questions anyway. You shouldn't have gone and\nchecked all those bridges. You should've just\nstarted asking questions. Now  I get to draw\ntwo more cards. Is there water\nflowing under that? There actually is.\nOkay. This seems promising. No  but very close. It's a miss anyway.\nOkay  I think we got it. Radar's a miss.\nIt's a miss? I think we gotta head to that.\nOkay. Okay  well that's not great. Yeah  I mean \nall signs point to that one bridge that we missed.\nOkay. Now I get to look\nat the top two cards and draw one of them. Well  there are\nsome Curses in here that I could get that\ncould be quite good. (chuckles) It's a ten minute bonus or it's Curse of\nthe Gambler's Feet. Curse of the Gambler's Feet. For the next hour \nSeekers must roll a die before they take any\nsteps in any direction. Casting cost: Roll a die. If it's an even number \nthis Curse has no effect. I do have to\nroll an even number in order to get to work \nbut  I'm gonna try. I got my die. You know \nI'm gonna get up close. We're gonna make sure that\nwe can see the die here. So I'm gonna take one\nof these guys  and... We need an odd number. Oh  that's a five. I am so  so sorry  Sam and Adam. This is what\nI was talking about. Alright! Three. Three. Six. One. Four. Alright  well look. Sam and Adam are not moving fast \nbut let me tell you  they're at least moving\nthe right way. Again  either way  it's gonna take them a\nwhile to get here  so... I'm still sitting pretty. Three. This sucks. I think we wanna go this way.\nOne. Well  let's make sure\nwe go the right way. Two. Five. Four. Five. Two. As I look at the map\nand I watch Sam and Adam sort of slowly limp towards me as I know that they are\nliterally rolling dice every time they want to take steps \nI'm reminded that... this is a lot of fun. And you can in fact make your friends do this\nvery same thing at home. Because you can buy  again \nyou can buy this game  and you can play with your friends \nand you can make them roll dice a bunch of times\nand get really mad at you. You just can't have that kind of fun\non PlayStation 5. Adam.\nOne. Say Jet Lag: The Game\nFive. ...hide-and-seek\nis a fun home game that people should want to play.\nOne. Look. Should we include this Curse? I ultimately do think\nthe Curse is fun. Yeah. Four. Five. Two. Three. Five. Two. Two. One. Five. Four. Three. Five. Five. Three. Three. One. Four. Six. Five. Four. One. Six. Four. Five. Six. One. Looking promising. Two. One. Four. Five. Four. One. One. Two.\nTwo. Three. Six. One. Four. I see him.\nI found a small man. Hi  Ben! Should we come down\nand meet you? Hello. Sorry  I know that I did\na lot of annoying things to you. You got your lemons  though. You got your lemons nicely—\nGive him his souvenir. Oh yeah.\nBen  here's your souvenir. Oh boy  a rock.\nDo you love it? I love it.\nWhoa  that's littering. It's a rock. Okay. Aaahhh... Good bye.\nAdam  good luck. Alright  where's the... Where do you think he's going? Figure it out.\nThat way? Alright.\nThis timing is not perfect. But frankly  it could be worse. Let's see what we can do. Alright. Let's see\nif we can pull this off. Alright  well... It took looking until\nthe very last minute. But I finally found a hiding zone\nthat I feel good about. And I'll see you tomorrow morning\nto show it to you. Good night! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Adam  where are you? Well  you know \nyou'll find out soon. And you  actually \nyou could find out right now if you subscribe to Nebula. Because the next episode\nof Jet Lag: The Game is up right now on Nebula. You could see exactly\nwhere I'm hiding. You could see if I get found\nor how long it takes. You could learn all that\ninformation right now by watching the next episode\nright now on Nebula. Are we allowed to do that?\nLots of quality— No  we can't see. We can't know. But there's lots of quality\nentertainment for you right now on Nebula \nincluding: We have a whole aftershow\npodcast exclusive to Nebula where we talk about\nthe behind-the-scenes. We talk about\nall kinds of strategy stuff that we don't actually have time\nto talk about during the show. So if you really want to get into\nthe nitty-gritty of the episode  you listen to The Layover on Nebula.\nThe game design. We talk a lot about\nhow we designed the game. We talk about\nwhat we had for dinner. Mhm. Sometimes we talk about\nreally stupid stuff. It's enthralling. And that's not\nthe only thing on Nebula. There actually are  like  way  way  way more other things. So  in addition to\nthere being  you know  a lot of your favorite\nYouTube creators also post their stuff on Nebula  it's often extended \nor early  or ad-free  or some combination of all of this.\nWell  it's always ad-free. Oh  sorry  well \nit's always ad-free. But it's also often\nearly and extended and sometimes a combination\nof all these things. But there are also\na lot of Nebula Originals  Nebula exclusives \nthings that are only on Nebula. There's actually a whole\nseries that we made. The Getaway  a reality series that's sort of like\nThe Mole or The Traitors  but we made everybody\nthe mole  and they didn't realize\nthey were all the mole. That's fun. But other people\nhave made things too. There are narrative films like Dracula's Ex Girlfriend\nand Identiteaze and Night of the Coconut. And there are documentaries. Documentaries such as\nones that we've made  like The Colorado Problem. Boomers is a documentary that just came out \nand that's a good one. Brian McManus made a whole series  Battle of Britain.\nI mean  there's a lot of stuff. I think what\nwe're trying to say is that there's a lot of\ntop-quality original content made by  you know  kinda\nindie creators and stuff. And  you know  it makes sense\nbecause turns out the creators founded Nebula. Whoa!\nWhoa! We were like \n\"Yo  what would it be like if we made a streaming site \nbut it was actually cool and dope?\" That was really cool  Sam. That was awesome\nhow you did that. And ethical and\npay the creators well and... not just making a cooking show\nfor the 10 millionth time. Anyways... Nebula's good. That's the pitch. And you could check out\nwhy Nebula's so good for a discount for 40% off.\nOoh! If you were to go to\nnebula.tv/jetlag. And here's the crazy thing. You see  you know how\nin the show  we take a bajillion\ndifferent trains  and we fly to foreign countries  and we have to buy food\nand all those sorts of things? Every single dollar of that comes\nfrom our Nebula subscribers. This show is entirely funded by\nall our Nebula subscribers. And turns out that there's\ntens of thousands of people who have found it worthwhile. Not just for early episodes  but also for all the\nother stuff on there.

        "transcript": "Alright  well... I believe that this spot\nhas a few things that should throw them off. Here's hoping. Welcome to episode two of our six-day game of\nhide-and-seek across Japan. Quick reminder  in this game  the Hider has three and a half hours\nto travel anywhere in Japan  and then the Seekers\nhave to find them as quickly as possible\nby asking them questions from the giant question menu. Last episode  Ben was found in\nthe small town of Yamadera after hiding for\n9 hours and 19 minutes  plus 40 minutes of Time Bonus cards. Last night  Adam traveled from\nYamadera to his hiding spot  and now Ben and I\nneed to go find him. Ben! Ben! Wake up! Ben!\nOhh... ohh... Oh  it's time to go get Adam.\nLet's go  let's go! Alright  alright \nlet's go get him. Let's go get him.\n(both grunt) Alright  Ben. Seemingly the first decision\nwe need to make... is basically... which direction we go\nout of this town. Yep  there's one train\nin each direction. We gotta figure out\nwhich one we're getting on. My instinct... is that he went to Sendai. Because that would get him\nonto a much faster high-speed line. So he could get much\ngeographically further. Yeah.\nAnd I think  you know  everyone's first instinct is\nmore about physical distance. Right  like if he went\ntowards Yamagata last night... where could he have really gone? He could have gone a little bit up. He could have gone a little bit\ndown towards Yonezawa. I reckon a Radar is\nactually pretty useful  'cause more or less \nI think it'll tell us whether or not he took a fast Shinkansen. Take a look at a\n50-mile Radar. Yeah  let's see\nwhat that gets us. It would include Fukushima.\nIt would include Sendai. It would basically\nsplit the map in two. The things that he would go to if he did not take a fast\nShinkansen out of Sendai  and the things that\nhe would have gotten to if he had taken a fast\nShinkansen out of Sendai. What do you think?\nShould we hit him with it? (exhales stiffly) I think hit him with it.\nAlright  sending. Okay  so if the Radar...\nis a hit  we go to Yamagata. If it's a miss  we go to Sendai.\nI think so  yeah. Alright. Okay. So  somewhat predictably  they have started\nwith a 50-mile Radar. That is certainly a miss. I will tell them that. I mean  the thing about that is that it does\neliminate quite a lot. And especially  I think  it eliminates almost all of\nthe possibilities in the north. So it kind of gives them\na direction  I suppose. They can presumably just\ngo to the Shinkansen now. But that means that I get\nto draw my first cards. 10 minute bonus. Veto. I think it's gotta be veto  right?\nYeah  okay. Keep a veto. Alright. What's next? Do you want to check\nout this cool castle? So  what I do know \nBen  is that... Adam spent  legit  three hours searching\nfor his spot. Yeah  that sounds like Adam. What you looking at?\n(giggles) Find anything interesting? Sorry. And he was not happy\nwith his options. Oh  good. But what I do think \nbased on the three hours  is... he's not— he's gonna try\nto do something tricky. He's gonna try to do\nsomething unintuitive. We've gotta calibrate\nfor trickiness  I think. No  I know.\nHe likes winning. He does like winning. And I think he's\nintimidated  honestly  by your 9 hours and 59 minutes. Yeah. The thing about trains\nin these countries  Ohh!\nyou can get far. What? It's a miss.\nAlright. That's great.\nI think that's great. I think that's good. And that means that almost certainly\nhe couldn't have gone to Yamagata. Yeah. Here comes\nthe train to Yamagata. Which we are not taking  right? I think that we are\ngoing to skip that one. Okay  so... What do we do? So this is (bleep) Castle. Or I guess it's\nthe ruins of (bleep) Castle. This is a really old house\nwith a traditional thatched roof  which is kind of cool. There's a little sign here that explains it's\na Tateana structure. It's called a Kabetachishiki\nTateana Jukyo. I definitely said that wrong.\nPretty neat  though. I do have to be honest with you that there are just such an\ninsane number of bugs here. So I am going to go to a\nslightly more open area and see if that helps. Hello  butterfly. Okay  we're just looking at\nother questions we can ask to try and figure out... what direction to go once\nwe get to Sendai  'cause... Yeah  so... I feel good\nabout going to Sendai  but I don't know what we're\ngoing to do after that. Yeah  I mean  the one thing\nthat is uniquely useful right now  and Adam and I were\nactually looking at this  and we wanted to use this\nuntil you Cursed us yesterday... (snickers)\nwas the last name of the prefecture. Because basically \nhalf of the prefectures in our likely area end with A.\nAnd we're currently in Yamagata. So we would exclude or include\nFukushima  Akita  Niigata  and  you know  some others. Whereas these ones  you know  it sort of splits the area\nin two  basically. I mean  the best thing\nyou can do with these questions is just to split the\nremaining area in half. Okay  well  we need to ask now\nbefore we leave Yamagata. Should we do it?\nI think let's do it. I think let's do it.\nOkay. Yep  train to Sendai is here. I think that'll be useful. Yeah  it might not be the thing\nthat gives us direction right now  but it'll very much be useful\nat some point. Yeah  I like it.\nOkay  let's go to Sendai. Okay  they've asked for\nthe last letter of my prefecture. They're in the Yamagata prefecture \nwhich ends with A. I'm not gonna tell you\nwhat prefecture I'm in  but it does not end with A.\nI'll tell you that. But I do get to draw...\nthree more cards. Five minute bonus  not great. Veto question  again  okay. And then a bonus. Well  awesome. Not great cards so far  guys. Not great cards. This is not what we need. I wonder what they're up to. Okay  so they have headed east towards Sendai on that line. Which is the sort of better\ndirection for them to go. I would have preferred\nif they had gone west. So that is annoying but ultimately probably not\na huge difference maker. Alright  we got our answer. Not a match. Okay. That's a lot of... That's pretty good. Especially considering that... we're almost certain he—\nthis is all gone. Just 'cause he couldn't\nhave gotten that far. So  he basically... is probably up here. Yeah. He— I don't even know if\nhe could have gotten down here. We can look into it.\nOr he could be in Tokyo. Which would be so annoying.\nWhich would be so annoying. We should investigate\nthis area here. Yeah  so what's in there? Because I actually think\nthat there's a chance that he could not have\ngotten here. Because I think that\nhe could have only taken the fastest Shinkansen from Sendai \nwhich might not stop there. Interesting  interesting. Oh no  wait.\nOh  this is tricky. So he could have gotten\nto Ōmiya. But Ōmiya is in Saitama. But he could have gone\nto Ōmiya and gone north. Why would he have\ndone that  though? I don't think\nhe would have. But... Okay  I won't cross this out \nbut I think that the chance that he could have gotten here...\nWe can consider this unlikely. Very unlikely. I know that this is cursing us \nbut I'm just adding a little 'probably not' this area. So... We don't think he's here. We think it's unlikely\nthat he's in Tokyo  because he could\nhave really just gone to Tokyo Station. The sort of behavioral\nanalysis on Adam says no. Yeah. He could not have gone\nto Hokkaido based on time. So we think he is in one\nof these two prefectures. Yeah. Since this is\nthe Shinkansen line  we could go from Sendai\nall the way to Morioka. In just 40 minutes.\nYeah. Yeah. Well  if we went up there  then we could just ask\nthe prefecture question and hopefully slice the\nremaining map in two. And especially  I mean  that's the biggest prefecture.\nYeah. I think that there's\na very good chance he's in that top one.\nMhm. Adam  we're coming for you.\nI think  probably. Maybe.\nMaybe. I think so. Okay  so obviously\nwhile we're here... we need to be looking\nfor hiding spots. Now  the woods is\ncertainly an option. But here's the thing. You have to hide within\n10 feet of a path or an area meant for walking. And the path network\nin this whole area is not actually as complicated\nas I might like for it to be. So I'm gonna bank\nthis area as a possibility  but I think we should go to the slightly more developed\narea of the hiding zone and kind of check that out. Okay  so this area... I think is just too open\nfor the most part. They could go here and\ntake a big look around and  you know \nfind a picture of the tallest manmade structure\nif they made me send that. Let's see if there's\nanything kinda further down. Okay  here's a thought. What if I hide in the woods \nbut not the woods they think? What if I hide... in those trees? Right? Because once they\nsee that I'm in trees  they'll assume I'm in the big park. And they'll go there and\nspend all their time there. They probably won't\neven think to check a different set of trees. Welcome back  Sam. Thank you. Alright  should we head to the Shinkansen section\nand head north? Yep  I think we're just\ngoing to send it up north and check and see if he's\nin the same prefecture. Might as well. I think we got time. And honestly  if we end up\nbeing right about this  it's going to save us\na ton of time in the end. Oh yeah  I think it's a risk.\nIt's certainly a risk. But one worth taking.\nYeah. Alright  let's find a Shinkansen. Look at that.\nIt's a bamboo forest. Kinda fun. Probably can't hide there  though. Okay  so they've just\narrived in Sendai  which means that they should\nbe having to make a decision. I'm actually not sure if\nthey know with confidence which direction to go. But even if they do \nthe bigger question is going to be how far in a direction do they go? And I don't think they have\na good sense of that. My hope with this placement\nis that there's a good chance they overshoot me. I have to say  it's been a while\nsince they asked me a question. Which is a little surprising.\nThey've only asked two. You'd kind of think they'd\nbe asking me questions  you know  before they got there  so that they could\nget right on a train. I mean  maybe they are just\ngetting right on a train. Alright. Adam's either going to be\nvery pleased or very upset that we are getting on this train. Yep. Alright  so\nwhat I said before... Kind of interesting\nthe way it turned out. They did get on a Shinkansen. Wrong one  boys. Wrong one. They are headed the wrong way.\nAlright  good. Okay  so this path is\nkind of intriguing to me because I think that if I\ngo down it far enough... I can maybe access the woods\nthat are on its left. And that could be very interesting. Because  again \nI'd really like to hide... in a different set of woods\nthat they won't expect. Oh  maybe down there. Okay  now we're talking  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Those are some random woods. Okay  and this is a weird path.\nVery weird. Alright  Ben.\nWe're here. We're about to enter into\nthis prefecture here. Come on. Oh  there we are.\nOkay  we're in it. Let's text him. This is nice. Oh  lovely. Let's go dip our feet in the river. That sounds like it\nwould be so nice. Well  they have asked if I am in the same\nprefecture as them. And the answer is\nthat I simply am not. I simply am not! This also means I\nneed to draw my cards. I really need these to\nbe better this time. Alright  one. Okay  we got a Curse. Curse of the\nMediocre Travel Agent. Choose any publicly accessible place within a half mile of the\nSeekers' current location. They must go there \nspend at least 10 minutes there  and acquire a souvenir\nbefore asking another question. Casting cost:\nTheir vacation destination must be further from you\nthan their current location. Two. 10 minute bonus. Three. Got another Curse. Curse of the Frozen Dot. Place a point on the map\nat least 1 000 feet from where the Seekers are currently standing. If in exactly 15 minutes  they are within\n250 feet of that point  they are frozen in place\nfor the next 30 minutes. Yeah  Curse of the\nMediocre Travel Agent  for sure. For sure. Well  that was better. Our answer should\nbe coming any second now. What do you think?\nOh  god  I don't know  Sam. I think he's probably\nin this prefecture. I agree. If he went much further north \nhe wouldn't have enough time to transfer onto\nanother smaller line. Oh  honestly  his ability to do\nthat in here  even  is pretty limited. It's a no. Alright  okay. That's big.\n(sighs) Okay  quickly  let's decide. Do we want to do a Thermometer?\nI think we got to... Okay  so now at this point... He could either be...\nup in this tiny area... or he could be down in Tokyo or he could maybe\ntechnically be in here  but he would have had to\ndo something really weird. Or we've messed up\ncatastrophically. Or we've messed up\ncatastrophically. Don't forget that option. I think we need\nto do a Thermometer because I think we need\nto know if he's up here. Do we want to do\na 5  a 15? I mean we could do\na 15 really easily. Yeah  I think we just hit a 15. Okay  should I start it?\nYeah. Yeah. 'Cause  boy  if he's... If it's wrong  if it's colder \nwe have (bleep)-ed up a lot. Alright  we're at the\nend of our Thermometer. That was quick.\nAlright  send it. Now I'm getting nervous. Now this is giving me flashbacks\nto our time in Switzerland. Shh-shh-shh-shh.\nWe're not there yet  Sam. We're not there yet.\nNo  we're not. But if this Thermometer\nis not hotter  we got an issue. Alright  they have done\na Thermometer. 15 miles. Seemingly  they're just\ntrying to figure out if I'm north or south of them. Again  I could veto  but I feel like they could\njust get the information from a Radar if I did that  so... I don't actually think\nthat that would be worth it. (sighs) Okay. I will tell them. Colder  colder. We're cooked! Okay  no  we're not cooked.\nOkay  well  we need to get off. Okay  yeah \nwe do need to get off. Also  we're cooked. This is it.\nShh  shh  shh. It's so over  Ben.\nShut up  shut up. It's so over.\nOkay  let's get off the train. How is he south? Oh  god damn it. I don't get it. Well... Look  there's a couple of \nthere's still a couple of options. There are a couple\nof options  but... for the most part \nit's Tokyo Station. Or there's that little bit... right above Sendai. (bleep) Could he really just be\nsitting outside of Tokyo Station? Alright  two more cards. Discard two  draw three. I don't hate that. Or a five minute bonus.\nYeah  okay. I'll take discard two  draw three. Alright  well... We have our hiding spot. I say we go back to\nour castle area. Just 'cause it's a nice place\nto hang out  more than anything. I have to say that this is\npretty good for me. You know  we're  what... three hours into the game day  and I think they're\nfurther from me now than when they started. It's not bad. What do we even do now?\nWe're going back. We're going back  Sam. The thing is  Ben... Adam and I were\ntalking a lot yesterday about how tricky it is that... on the line between\nSendai and Tokyo... there's all sorts of\ndifferent Shinkansens with different\nconfigurations of stops. Some are super express\nand go straight to Tokyo. Some make a couple of stops.\nSome make all of the stops. It's very possible\nthat there was a Shinkansen... that made a weird\nstop configuration. Which means that part of that prefecture\nis fair game. Or something like that.\nI don't know. Alright  we've been\ndeep in research mode and are not pleased\nabout the options. I mean  there\njust aren't that many. 'Cause we think\nwe've excluded... We've really drilled\ninto this area here. But we really don't see options\nwhen you look at schedules and our Radar and kinda\nall the things combined. Every single thing\ncan be excluded based on one factor\nthat we can find. Yeah  but I mean  look  it's...\nYou never know. As far as we can tell \nthere are pretty few options. And it's Tokyo...\nor some of the stops in there. Yeah. But the reason we don't like it is 'cause it's pretty much\njust the Shinkansen stops. And we don't really think Adam would just go to\na Shinkansen stop. No  it seems unlikely.\nIt just doesn't feel right. Which  you know \nmaybe he's playing us. And maybe he knows that we don't think that\nhe would do that. I think we need a vibe. Yeah  photo question.\nWe need a vibe check. Yeah. Photos are cheap. I think tallest building\nvisible from train station will tell us a lot  because... If he's in Ueno or Tokyo  it's gonna be a giant skyscraper.\nMhm. I would be game for\ntallest building. Let's try that.\nOkay. Should we send it?\nYeah. I'd just gotten so comfy. Alright. (grunts) We actually\nhave to hurry a little bit if we're gonna get this in\nwithin the 15 minutes. Alright. Almost there. Alright. So this is\nbased on our judgment. What do we think\nthe tallest building is? I don't think it's the houses.\nI can really only see the houses. Those silos. I think it's that warehouse. Nothing looks taller\nto me than that. By my judgment  that is\nthe tallest building. I'm gonna take a picture of it... and send it to them. While we're here \nlet's draw our card. Ooh! Alright. It's not too bad. Little 15 minute bonus\nnever hurt anyone. Alright  we got a photo. This is giving... small. Yeah  I mean \nit's certainly not a skyscraper  I'll tell you that much. Yeah  so  basically I think we know\nthat he's not in a big city. And also  those trees look forest.\nI mean  they're dense. He's not in Tokyo.\nHe's not in Ueno. I mean  honestly... it feels like the most\nlikely scenario now is that we've messed up\nsomehow. With the assumption in that photo\nthat it's a pretty small place. Which it kinda has to be  if that's the tallest building\nfrom the station. The tallest building\nfrom the station is a single story building. I just don't see... The problem is... The way he would get down here\nis he would take a Shinkansen and then he would have\nvery little time at all to get out of the area. Especially somewhere like that. Just don't get it.\nIt's a real head scratcher. I thought we were\nso on the right track. Me too. I think at this point  I would just hit\na 100 mile Radar to check that little sliver. And also  if somehow we misdrew our map\nor something. Or we're illiterate. Yeah  I mean \nit would at least tell us that we definitely want\nto head down to there-ish. Right. I guess.\nIt's only two cards. Sent. I think we're cooked. No  we're not cooked. He's cooked. It's getting really hot. Okay  so they've asked for\na 100 mile Radar now. You know? Maybe I should veto it. I guess  what \nthey could just do... a hotter  colder. I guess they're on a\nShinkansen headed south. So they could just go\na while and ask it. Okay. Let's draw two cards. Yeah. Eh. I guess let's take\nthe 10 minutes. And I have six cards  so... Let's actually use our other\ndiscard two  draw three. Play it out. I'm going to discard\nmy 10 minute bonus and a veto. Let's draw three new cards just out of curiosity. Randomize question. Curse of the Hidden Hangman. Curse of the Hidden Hangman. Before asking another question or boarding another\nform of transportation  Seekers must beat the Hider\nin a game of hangman. Casting cost: Discard two cards. Duplicate another card.\nOh  those are some good ones. Once they get off their train... it might be time\nfor some Curses. Ben! (clattering)\nOh no. What's the status  Sam? I think this is good news?\nIt's a miss. I mean  it at least gives us\nsome good direction. Yeah  we just\nstay on this train. So we just need to\ndrill into the options... there-ish.\nYeah. There's gotta be something.\nYeah. Maybe there was a\nShinkansen that we missed. We just gotta keep looking. Alright  let's go back\nto the woods. 'Cause it's a nicer place\nto hang out. (groans flatly)\nLot of walking today. I guess I'm making myself\ndo it  but I like... I like to be in the woods. Look at our\nabsolutely busted map. Look how st—\n(clatters) We're not doing so hot  Sam. We're not doing so hot. We have asked\nso many questions. How many questions... have we asked? Too many.\nSix questions. Given that he has not\nplayed anything yet... that does mean that\nhis hand should be full. True.\nWhich means that if... we ask another question now  he's gonna have to\nimmediately play or discard something. So... This would be a good time\nto get something. I would love...\nmaybe the five buildings thing. If it is a not very dense area  he might have to send us\na pretty big shot to get five buildings in it.\nThat could have a lot of info. Yeah  and he\nmight have no choice but to sort of reveal something\nthat he doesn't want to reveal. Should we try it?\nYeah  I say  go for it. Let's do it.\nAlright  Adam. Go find us five buildings. (panting heavily) Well  great news. I made it into the woods\njust in time for them to ask for a photo of five buildings. (exhales) Okay.\nIt's actually not that bad. There are buildings\nnot too far from where I am. I think the key for me\nin terms of strategy is I don't really want them to know just how rural this place is. I want to make it look\nas urbanized as possible  I think. I mean  the tallest building\nfrom the train station probably gave that away  but... You know. Okay. What is the most busy looking\nthing we've got here? Okay  this isn't bad.\nI guess it's only one building. That's some good density there. And I feel like \nwith the right angle  that could look\nrelatively... developed. Okay.\n(full mouth) We got a photo. We got the photo. It's very built.\nI know. Look at all those buildings. That's a little more\nnot a small town  more just residential.\nMhm. That's a pretty big\nand nice house for Japan. Yeah. Maybe it's a suburb\nor something. Yeah  that's what I'm feeling. It just has a small station. Now that we thought Adam\nwas likely in a suburban area  we took an even closer look\nat what his options were  and we found something\nwe had missed. While we previously thought\nthat he would have arrived at any Shinkansen stop in this area without enough time to\ntransfer onto a smaller line  we found one train that would have gotten\nhim into Utsunomiya with about 25 minutes\nto get out of the city. That put Utsunomiya at the\ntop of our suspects list. So  we started looking\nat satellite views of all the lines out of Utsunomiya\nto see if anything seemed right. Sam  just anecdotally \ndoesn't this... I'm looking at Kōnoyama Station. And it's a suburb\naround a golf course. I'm not saying that\nthis is the station  but it's got the same sort of\ndensity of trees  and... Density  it fits. I just don't really see the trees\nthat would be necessary. But I'm still looking. Real quick \nlet's draw our card. We already have a full hand. So  I'm gonna have\nto decide what to do. Five minute bonus?\nYeah  I'll just discard that. Just discard that.\nThat's fine. Oh man  it's hot. Oh  it's hot. Wait  can you pull up— Are you recording?\nYeah. Can you pull up the\ntallest building photo? This guy? What? Do you think you see it? Show me what you're seeing.\nLook at that. Oh  yeah.\nAm I crazy  or is that that? Here's what— Here  let me— Wait  wait  wait  wait. Because he even has\nthe light pole. Just by the way \nwe aren't allowed to use Google Street View in this game.\nWhat happened here is way crazier. I clicked on this station\non Google Maps  and this picture  showing the\nbuilding in the background  just happened to be\nthe display image. Yeah  it does have\nthe light pole. And it has the white sign. Let me— Let's— Okay. This is crazy  if... 'Cause the light rail\nwould make sense  'cause it's counterintuitive.\nIs that off the light rail? This is on the light—\nThis is off the light rail. And it'd be counterintuitive.\nIt's weird. This is towards\nthe end of the line that he could have gotten. Here's— Here— Let me show you what made me\neven look at this station. It's for a castle. Adam Chase. Castles are Adam Chase's\ngreatest weakness in this world. He loves a good castle.\nHe loves a castle. Let's go find a nice spot\nto sit down. Okay  so quick update.\nThey're getting pretty close. I was hoping they\nmight undershoot me. Doesn't seem like that's\ngonna be the case. Now we're hoping\nthat they overshoot. So yeah  so basically... I'm hoping that we are\nnot cutting to them getting off the train. If we're cutting to them\ngetting off the train... That is not\nsuper awesome for me. That was a long train ride. Welcome to Utsunomiya. Productive  I think. Let's hope. I think we're about to get\nhit with a bunch of Curses. Yes  but if this spot is not it  I am quitting. Yeah  I think that's fair. (pneumatic hissing) (door mechanism clicking) Okay  well \nthey got off their train. I don't love having to\ndiscard two  but I think I'm going to do\nCurse of the Hidden Hangman with a veto question and\nrandomized question discarded. Just buy myself some time here. Alright  so now they cannot\nmove or ask another question until they beat me at hangman. So I have to think\nof my hangman word. Famously  the hardest\nword in hangman is 'jazz'. So for five letters \nwhich I have to do  you could do like 'jazzy'. But I think that\nthey might be like  \"Oh  Adam will pick\nthe hardest word.\" And they'll see through that. So I think I need\nto pick a hard word but one that is not that... ...strange. Curse of the Hidden Hangman.\nWhich one was that? Curse of the Hidden Hangman. Before asking another question or boarding another\nform of transportation  Seekers must beat the Hider\nin a game of hangman. To play  the Hider chooses\na five-letter word  and the game ends after\neither a correct word guess or seven wrong letter guesses. The Seekers cannot\nchallenge the Hider for ten minutes after a loss. After three losses \nthe Seekers are released. Alright  well  this is a\nfairly high stakes game of hangman that we've gotta play. If we fail  then we get\nstuck here for a little bit. Alright  should we start\nwith just  what  A? E.\nE? Okay. So they have started\nwith E. No. (bleep) He's picked a— How about I?\nI. Also  no. Hit him with an A. A. Yes. Smack dab in the middle. Maybe we should do a T. T. No. (bleep)\nHit him with an S. S. Oh  shee... H.\nNo. Alright.\nWe moved into the shade. The camera has melted. N is one of the\nmore common letters. N. No. Alright. We're doing good.\nWe're doing good. It's a no. C? I like C. I feel like that's kinda... You never expect...\nto see a C. C. (bleep) Yes!\nOkay. Okay. Do an L. L. Good.\nOne more wrong guess. Ack! No?\nNo. Scar... Scarf. 'Scarf' is pretty good. 'Scary'?\n'Scary'. Yeah  I feel like\nR is promising. Let's hit him with the R.\nHit him with the R. The R. We got it. Okay  one more. Is it 'scarf' or is it 'scary'?\nIt's 'scary'. The word is 'scary'. Ye-hes! (chuckles) Barely made it out of that.\nAlright. Okay  we'll challenge\nhim again in ten. Ben  for round two. Go with the E. Let's do it. E. No. Y.\nY. Okay  that's annoying that\nthey guessed that that early. Oho  we got that. A.\nNo. Hit him with an O. Also no. Hit him with an I.\nNo. Alright  this is going\npretty good. It was the U all along. Yeah  okay. Should we try M?\nYeah  try M. M  no. (bleep) No. Do you like L or F?\nF. Okay  yeah  there is an F. Yes  there we go. I bet it's 'funny'. But should we try\n'funny' or 'fuzzy'? Try N.\nNo. Alright  come on.\nOne more. One more wrong guess.\nOne more wrong guess. (grumbles) Send him... 'fuzzy'.\nNo. Is it 'fuzzy'?\nLock it in. Oh (bleep) (giggles)\nYeah! He said (bleep) Okay  let's go get him. I mean  look  that\nstill bought me a while. Because it took a while to\nplay the games of hangman. So... ultimately... it could be worse. They're not asking any questions. So you have to imagine that they are trying to\nfigure out what to do. And there's still a pretty wide area\nwhere I could be. So I don't think that... they have a direction\nto go right now. This is great. This is the fanciest\nlight rail I've ever seen. Yeah  I don't think I've ever been\non a light rail this nice. Eeyuh-oh! It looks like somehow\nthey are headed towards me? How could they possibly\nknow that I'm this way? Oh my god! How did they figure that out?! That's insane. From what  from the photo? They can't have figured it out\nfrom the photo. Okay  well  we don't have time to get to the where\nwe were going to hide. Okay  let's find a spot.\nLet's find a spot in here. (bleep) This is it. This better be it. I need to get out of\nthis open woods area. What do we think about this?\nUnder this bridge? No  if they ask the\ntallest thing I can see... they'll see a tree  and then they'll know I'm\nin a bridge in the woods. (bleep) me. What the (bleep)? What the (bleep)? We're getting\npretty close  Ben. Technically  Adam\ndoesn't have to be in his hiding spot\nuntil a half mile out. But I have to imagine\nhe's gonna be near it right now. I'm worried that we're\ngonna get by the Curse. As soon as we get there.\nYeah. I think if we just ask him \nbecause I feel like we'll probably only need one  maybe\ntwo questions to find him. Yeah. But yeah  I feel like\nwe ask him a question right before we get there.\nWhat about tallest structure? The tallest structure\ncan be good. I just  I worry that he's\ngoing to return nothing if he can't see anything. I mean  that would\nbe useful  but... Yeah  but he's probably\nable to see some structure. I feel like  right?\nYeah. Okay. Hit him with\ntallest structure. (bleep) me. Nope. Have to find a path\nthat's not on the map. Okay  maybe here? Around here? Okay. Alright  this is the spot. Here it is  Ben.\nIs this the building? I think it's that. Sure looks right. That  I think  is our building. I mean  that  look \nit's the exact... That's gotta be it. It's— That's gotta be it.\nI think that's it. I mean  we should look\nfrom the station perspective  but it is the tallest\nbuilding around. And these...\n(tapping glass) are the right kind of light poles. That looks like\nthe right light pole. (doors click open)\n(tap sensor beeps) It is 100% it. Because  look  you can see the electric thing\nin the right spot. Yeah  that is 100% it. Because you can see there's\na paper in the first window. That's there. Yeah.\nThe trees are the same shape. The sign's in the right spot.\nThat's it. I don't know what angle\nhe took it from. But we got him. I think we got him. Bet he's by the stupid castle again. Yeah  let's start\nwalking to the castle. Because that's  I think \nthe most obvious spot. Alright. This is my hiding spot. Now  the reason I picked it... I mean  I was very frantic  but...\nIf you go to Google Maps... it'll tell you to enter\nthe park the other way  and I'm hopeful that they'll do that\ninstead of going up this way. Alright  that would be the\ntallest manmade structure. Now that I've sent them\nthe tallest structure  let's pull another card. Okay! I'll take that. That's not bad. Alright  we're gonna do two things. First  we're gonna duplicate the Curse of the\nMediocre Travel Agent. Then  we're going to cast the Curse of the\nMediocre Travel Agent and make them go to the\nNishigi Dental Clinic. That should buy me some time. Alright  we got the photo  Ben.\nYeah  what's it look like? It's forest. Okay  forest. Actually  the one thing\nI'm noticing... Visit the Nishigi Dental Clinic. Why do we have to do that? The Curse is making us\nvisit the dental clinic. Curse of the\nMediocre Travel Agent. The Seekers must go to the\nHider's chosen location  spend at least 10 minutes there \nand acquire a souvenir before asking another question. The location must be\nfurther from the Seekers than the Hider. But hold on  Sam. We only have to clear that one\nif we want to ask another question. It also tells us something. Their vacation destination\nmust be further from you than their current location. So... So it means\nhe must be this way. Is the dentist that way?\nYeah. Yeah. Do you want to search the park? 'Cause it would take 24 minutes\nto walk to this dental clinic. So it'd be almost \nyou know  50 minutes. We've split the thing in two \nand we know he's in the woods. I reckon we\nLet's... How much woods is there? I think it's... At least we're getting in here and starting looking before we walk\nhalf an hour back that way. Is that up there \nis that a public path? That seems like\nit goes into the... park. Yeah  it says  it seems like\nthis is the way  yeah. Check this out? That  said  get in and out \nwhether it's this way or the park. I don't know  Sam.\nThese woods are dense. Yeah  but he has to be\nnear a path. Yeah. Is it this way? (mutters indistinctly) They're right behind me. Look there  Ben. He's literally right there. Aah! Ohh! I was so scared! I was so scared\nwe would be in the woods for so... many hours. Ladies and gentlemen \nwe got him. How did you know\nto come here? You're gonna hate this. I looked along... We narrowed it down to\nall the options out of here. I was looking along here\nfor bits of forest. Areas where you can get\nto forest near here. I saw \"Castle Site.\"\n\"Adam's gonna love that.\" And then I clicked on \nand then the first thing I saw in the station photo\nhad the building that you sent in the background. And that was like  that's that. Well  this sucks. Okay  I'm gonna go.\nGood bye! Bye  Sam. Good luck. See you on Saturday. This is so (bleep)-ed up\nwhat just happened. That you left Utsunomiya\nand went directly to me. You had— There were\ntwo prefectures that I could have\nbeen in at that point! And you found the exact station? Alright. I made it\nto my hiding spot. And I've done something\nso dumb... that I think it\nmight just be genius. I've come to the airport!

        "transcript": "It's 7:30 am \nthe game day just started  and I'm in my hiding spot. And I've done something\nthat I think is... so dumb that\nit might just be genius. I've come to the airport! Welcome to episode three of our six day game of\nhide-and-seek across Japan. After finding Ben in the\nmountain town of Yamadera and Adam in the forests\nby Tobiyama Castle  now it's my turn to see\nif I can set a winning time. As a reminder  in this game \nthe Hider has three and a half hours to get to a hiding spot. Then  the Seekers gain information\nabout the Hider's location by choosing questions\nfrom the question menu. I  the Hider  have\nto answer truthfully  but in exchange  I get cards\nthat can help me slow them down. So  without further ado \nlet's go to Ben and Adam  starting where we\nfound Adam yesterday as they try to track me down. Alright. Good morning from the woods. It is 7:30 am  and that means\nthat it's time to find Sam. Let's go get him. Alright  so  first things first \nwe gotta figure out which direction we are gonna go. Are we going up the country\nor are we going down the country? Well  I'd say\nthe first direction we need to go is\nsort of out of the woods. Well  we do need\nto get out of the woods. Yeah  when\nwe get to Utsunomiya  we can either go\nback up northeast  right  towards where you hid\non that Shinkansen. Or we can go down towards\nŌmiya and Tokyo area. Yeah. Ben  I would love\nto find one question that can tell us\nwhich way to go and that doesn't require us to move a lot to do so. Okay  here's my logic. So  this game rewards risk because the winner\nis the longest run. It doesn't matter. Adam's run from yesterday?\nMeaningless. Because it didn't—\nIt wasn't longest. I don't think you're\ngonna get the longest run  or at least have the best shot\nof getting the longest run  by kinda just doing\nthe same thing. And there were plenty\nof options that I saw that would have been more or less the same\nkind of location profile. Small- to medium-sized town  you know  an hour to\ntwo hours on Shinkansen  then transferring\nonto a smaller line. The thing is \nyou're required in this game to center your location\non a train station. And basically \nevery single train station in the entire country serves a town  a city  a village  some population center. And therefore \nthat's kinda what you expect when you answer or\nask the questions. But the train station here? It doesn't serve a town.\nIt serves an airport. So my guess is that... the answers are going to be\nreally confusing to Ben and Adam. And this is massive.\nThere's three terminals. Each terminal has – even just in the publicly\naccessible area before security that I'm allowed to go into – there's a bajillion different\nmeandering locations. I'm gonna have a while\nto be able to look around and find a good spot. I could be completely wrong. I mean  I have no idea.\nI mean  I've never— Nobody has ever tried\nsomething like this. But  maybe it works out?\nMaybe this really confuses them? We'll see. Okay  well  we've made it\nback to the station. There's a light rail soon.\nSo  so far  we are killing it. Sam  you're toast.\nAlright  Ben. I actually think that I have\na really good solution here. We can do a matching question about if his nearest major\ninternational airport is the same as our nearest\nmajor international airport. The reason that's good is... we are closest to\nNarita Airport here. But Haneda Airport is right here. But what's good is there are no other major\ninternational airports in the whole top half\nof the country. So if he says  \"Yes  we share\nthe same closest airport \" we know he's closest to here.\nWhich means he's up here. He's this way  right?\nYeah. If the answer's no... then we know he can't\nbe anywhere up here. He has to be closer to Haneda\nor to one of the other ones  to Osaka or whatever  Nagoya. I mean  that certainly\ngives us a direction to go. I quite like that.\nOkay. I say we go for it.\nLet's hit him with it. Sam's never gonna\nsee this one coming. Alright  I've come to hang out\nin the massage chairs because it's already\nvery hot outside. Okay  first question. Ironically  it is... is your closest major\ninternational airport the same as ours? So  as you can imagine \nthat question freaked me out a bit  but I chose to believe that\nit was just a coincidence. Just because they asked me\nabout my nearest airport didn't mean they knew\nI was at the airport. However  you  the audience \ndo know I'm at the airport. And now you know\nit's Narita Airport  which means we're gonna do\nsomething a bit unusual this round. Boop  there I am!\nNow  let's see how they do. Alright.\nI am sending them their answer. This will definitely\ngive them some direction. Alright.\nOkay. We got our answer.\nWell that is very interesting. It's the same. So it means\nthe man's gone north. Well it means\nhe's gone north or... I mean there's  this is possible. Right  he could have gone\nmaybe to Niigata somehow. Yeah  but it's unlikely. I will say  here's\nwhat I will say  Adam. I know that Sam was very bothered\nby the weather yesterday. Sure. He might have been trying\nto go as far north as possible. I bet Adam didn't\nhave a massage function in the middle of\nthe woods yesterday. First card pull of the round  so... One. Two. Oops. Okay  so I got\nCurse of the Endless Tumble  a 15 minute bonus \nand a 15 minute bonus. Curse of the Endless Tumble. Seekers must roll a die\nat least 100 feet and have it land on 5 or 6 before they can ask\nanother question. Casting cost: Roll a die. If it's a 5 or a 6 \nthis card has no effect. I don't think\nthis is gonna cost them more than 15 minutes \nto be honest. I think I'm just gonna keep\nthe 15 minute time bonus. I'm gonna get a massage now. Oh my god  the seat's\ngoing backwards. Ohh. That's nice. That's very nice. Oh man  that's a great start. You love to see it. (paper flaps) In terms of the\ncomplexity of what's happening  nowhere here \nnone of this  none of... This is much simpler to deal with. Sam is not going to be\npleased about that at all. No. Ooh  it's getting my butt now. Oh! (chuckles) Oh  it's hitting my butt. Oh yeah. Oh! Alright. Welcome back to beautiful\nUtsunomiya Station. Ben  look  I don't\nwant to jinx anything  but I would make the argument that Sam going that direction\nwas stupid of him. No  he's cooked. It's been— This round\nis basically over. Okay  so I think just hop on\na Shinkansen headed north. Yep.\nAnd go from there. Yeah. We'll need to do some stuff\nto figure out a few things. I think maybe we go up\na little bit on the Shinkansen and hit him with a\n100 mile Radar because that would include Niigata.\nYeah. So then we would know\nif it's a miss  we don't have to worry about that. I think he's— he probably\nwent further than that. Probably. I wonder where\nBen and Adam think I am. Because I think it's just... I think it's just so unintuitive.\nHopefully. Maybe the one big risk of\ngoing here is that  you know  I'm sure the first comments\non this are going to be like  \"Oh  of course\nhe went to the airport.\" Because everyone thinks\nthat I've made an entire career off of airport content.\nWhich is  I guess  kind of true. I mean  this game is called\nJet Lag: The Game  and I made... and my other\nchannel became popular because of videos about\nairplanes and stuff. Ooh  it's gettin' the butt again. What am I eating? I don't know.\nOh  it's good  though. It's pretty good  though. Alright  a Shinkansen\nwill be here in a few minutes. Given that we just have\na little bit of time right now  feels like the thing to do\nis to ask for a picture. 'Cause the 15 minutes\nit takes to send it won't annoy us at all. You know  we could do\nthe five buildings. We could do... We could do widest street \nwhich we haven't done yet. Because five buildings\nis easier to manipulate. Widest street  which you\nhave to shoot a picture across the widest street \nI think tells us quite a lot about how urban it is. Well  it'll tell us\nif there's a highway in the middle of a city \nstuff like that. Alright  I say we do that.\nYeah. What is that?\nI don't know. There's a lot of goo\ncoming out. There's a lot of goo.\nIt's mostly goo. Alright  massage is over. I'll almost certainly be back \nbut I've been sent on a mission. Need to get a photo\nof the widest street. The photos  honestly \nare the ones I'm worried about. Gotta move fast to get\nto the spot on time. Okay  seems like the\nwidest street is not here  but there's a wider one kind of\nin the middle of the parking area. Okay  I'm gonna be honest.\nI just noticed that. And if they ask tallest building\nvisible from the train station  I am cooked. Alright  Ben.\nWe are heading up towards Sendai. This train stops at... Sendai  Fukushima \nKoriyama  and... in the Snack Zone. Welcome to The Snack Zone.\nIt's a show within a show where we review\nJapan's greatest snacks. Or just other stuff\nthat we find. Today we are having ekibens. I got this one with\nan angry chicken. I got the nice chicken. Oh yeah  yours is better. That's why you stick\nwith the nice chicken. Alright  this street here...\nseems to be the answer. Mostly 'cause...\nmost of them have a median. This one doesn't have a median. I'm going to take one\nright across from here. I don't think it's going\nto be tremendously helpful. The main thing that'll tell them is I'm probably not in\na very small place. Okay  now that that's done \nlet me pull my card. Curse... of the\nImpressionable Consumer. Curse of the\nImpressionable Consumer. The Seekers must buy a product\nthat they saw an advertisement for before asking another question. Casting cost: The Seekers'\nnext question is free. Okay  that's pretty good. Ooh  this is awesome. Looks like they took\na Shinkansen north. They probably did a 50-50 gamble\nand went north. And that is the wrong direction. Oh  Ben. It's a pretty wide street.\nThat's a pretty wide street. So he can't be\nsomewhere that small. No. There's not a street like that\nwhere I hit  certainly. You know where there\nis a street like that? Where?\nAll along the coast. I would not be surprised\nif he was on the coast. When do we want to\nhit him with the Radar? When we get to... Nasushiobara.\nNasushiobara. Yeah  I think if\nwe hit him with that  we'll be sitting pretty. So  I've got a theory\nof a hiding spot... that I want to check out.\nAnd I'll explain it. But first  I have to\nbe able to find it. Man  I'm thinking about\nhow tremendously cooked I am if they ask the\ntallest building thing. The tallest building visible from any entrance of\nthe train station. The control tower is\ndefinitely  definitely visible. So if they can identify that  they can figure out with\npretty good confidence that I'm in an airport. And they already know\nmy closest airport is Narita. Alright  Ben \nwe are in Nasushiobara. Yay. Let's hit him\nwith the Radar. 100 miles. I mean  it could sink it. Boy  we'll have gotten\nthe area down real quick. Real quick. Alright  just got hit by\n100 mile Radar. Let me see. Alright  I'm about 90 miles away\nfrom the 100 mile Radar  so it counts.\nSo that'll be that. Okay  I'm back at the scene\nas far as my last card to pull. One. Two. Ooh. Curse of the Ransom Note. The next question\nthat the Seekers ask must be composed of\nwords and letters cut out of any printed material. Casting cost: Spell out\n\"Curse of the Ransom Note\" as a ransom note. The next question\nthat the Seekers ask must be composed of\nwords and letters cut out of any printed material. Or... Randomize question. I think I'm going to keep\nrandomize question  'cause if they hit me with\nthe tallest building thing  I just hit them with\nthe randomize question. That would be pretty good. Ben... It's a hit.\nI would say that a hit is... more annoying in terms of \nwhat do we do now? If it was a miss  we'd just go up.\nWell  yeah. One of the biggest troubles...\nis this guy. It's still this.\nNiigata. Here's what\nI think we should do. Is his nearest Shinkansen line\nthe same as ours? If the answer's yes \nit means he's in this half. If the answer's no... Niigata or he's doing\nsomething with this. Yeah. I think that there's a decent\nchance he's on this coast. Yeah. That's kind of\nwhat I think  too. Okay  how do we feel about that? Yeah  let's do that.\nOkay. (zipper opening) And they just asked\nyet another question. It was the nearest Shinkansen. And I think the answer is yes? I need to check.\nThey're really dumping questions on. Oh  it is so close to being a miss. I am literally less than a mile from being closer to\nthe Tōkaidō Shinkansen. Let me let 'em know.\nThat's unfortunate. One. Two. Three.\nTen minute bonus. Curse of the Frozen Dot. Curse of the Frozen Dot. Place a point on the map\nat least 1 000 feet from where the Seekers are\ncurrently standing. If  in exactly 15 minutes  they are within\n250 feet of that point  they are frozen in place\nfor the next 30 minutes. That's interesting. Five minute bonus. Gotta keep\nCurse of the Frozen Dot. I mean  these aren't good bonuses.\nYeah  that's easy. Alright  I'm going exploring. Okay  we got our answer? Okay  yes  yes. So that means that he's\nalmost certainly... I mean  he could be here \nbut he's probably on the east coast. And this is the best place— This is the best\nconnecting to the east coast. So we should get off here. Yeah  'cause you can go to Iwaki.\nYeah. Okay.\nI bet he's on the coast. Yeah  yeah. Well  we should do\nsomething to confirm it. Here  let's go set up\na shot somewhere. So... The situation is complicated. The area we're dealing with\nis so small. But if he is on the coast...\nRight. The trains to get there\ntake so long. Well they take so long  or they don't run.\nLike here's what's annoying. Last night he could've\ngone up to Koriyama and then over to Iwaki. But those trains only\nrun in the afternoon. Right  so we can't do that.\nWe would have to go  I mean... Mother-(bleep)-er. I mean  we just need to\nfigure out as fast as possible if we need to start making that four or five hour\njourney to the coast. Is it really\nfour or five hours? Okay  wait wait  Ben. If we're doing this \nwe need to figure out now because this train doesn't leave\nfor a long time afterwards. Down to Mito? Yeah.\nNo  yeah. In fact  we would\nhave to get on that. I almost think that— We need to go get on it\njust as a safety precaution. It's too big of a risk\nto not do that. Okay  we need to\nask a question though. You wanna ask about the coast? Yes  I guess coast? I don't know  I mean  I'm searching for\na better idea here. We need to ask— I'm just going to ask\nabout coastline  Ben. We have to ask something. We have to ask something.\nYeah  I think... It's gotta be coast\nor elevation  right? I'm doing coast \nbecause we can get an answer before we have to get on this train.\nOkay. (bleep) I bet you anything\nthis is what he did. Okay  finally found\na way to Terminal 2. Let me tell you  it is so hard\nto navigate these areas. This is gonna suck for them. Alright  another question. They are really...\ngoing heavy with them which might be the right strategy.\nCloser or nearer from the coast? Okay  they are 35 miles. I am just 20. Actually less than that\nin this direction. I'm just 13 or so. So I'm definitely closer. Okay  another pull. One. Two. Three. Oh  five minutes \nfive minutes  five minutes  really?\nThree five minutes? Alright  well  I guess\nI'll take five minutes. Well  it seems like\nour train to Mito is delayed. We just can't tell what's going on\nbecause everything's in Japanese. Closer. Yeah  okay  that's what we thought.\nHe's gotta... But... bwuh... Okay  what do you reckon?\nYou want to ask about if he's in the same\nprefecture now  maybe? We need to start splitting this up.\nYeah. I mean  actually \nyou know what? Maybe the cheaper way\nof doing it isn't prefecture. Maybe we ask about—\nwe do a Radar. Maybe like a...\nLike 50. Like a 50. It also could be\nthe case that he... went all the way down\nto the coast down there. You know what I mean? I don't know  man. I mean... But  yeah  no  I think\na 50 mile Radar makes sense. Okay. We gotta start\ncutting options down. What a mess  Ben. Okay  well  still searching. Now I have a 50 mile Radar. It's gonna be a miss.\nBig miss. I think that's pretty good for me. I don't think it's gonna be... massively influential. Okay. Two  two  two. One  two. Curse of the Zoologist. Curse of the Zoologist. Take a photo of a wild fish  bird \nmammal  reptile  amphibian  or bug. The Seekers must take a picture of a wild animal in\nthe same category before asking another question. The other one's\na randomize question. I think I'm gonna keep\nrandomize question. That seems good. Yeah  I'm gonna keep\nrandomize question. ♫ (jingle over speakers) Oh  it's a jingle. \"Please line up\nto board the train.\" I mean  as long as it still shows \nI think it's just a little late. Yeah. Miss.\nInteresting. Okay  this is\nvery interesting  Ben. I think that's good.\nIt's a miss. I would argue that is good. I mean  it's possible he's up— There's this little sliver.\nThat little sliver. But are there even\ntrain stations in that sliver? Let's check.\nLet's check the sliver. I mean  there's the airport.\nThere's not a lot. Thanks to their train delay \nBen and Adam had some time to analyze the 50 mile Radar miss and further narrow\ndown possibilities. Lucky for them  they realized that\nthe train they were waiting for  that they would have already\nbeen on if it had been on time  would actually get them\nto the remaining options much more slowly.\nSo they shifted gears. But look  Ben.\nIt would be faster to not take this. Okay  well \ndo we want to get on the Shinkansen at 9:30? We gotta decide quickly  because that train's\nin three minutes. Let's get on the Shinkansen \nhead south Alright  let's go.\n...and do a hotter-colder. Do you know what platform\nthe Shinkansen is on? Nope. Keep going  keep going. Is that it leaving or arriving?\nI don't know. Arriving. I think. Yeah! Let's get on this. We gotta act quickly. Wow  we almost made\na pretty big blunder  I would say. That miss is good.\nThat miss is really good. It would have been  I mean \npretty freaking tough for us if he had been anywhere in there. Our next stop is more\nthan 50 miles away. Okay.\nSo... 50 mile hotter-colder starts now. Good news. I have finally found it. Yeah. See  there's going\nto be an underpass. Yeah  there we go. Okay. Oh  wow. This is a long hallway. Okay  they're starting\na 50 mile hotter-colder. Presumably  they're\ngoing to head south then. So  my understanding... is that this is an\nold train station. It was Narita Airport's\nfirst train station before it kind of grew big. It's kind of in the\ncenter of everything. That means it's far from\nthe actual terminals. And you just saw \nit took me an hour to find this entrance. You have to kind of\nnavigate your way through the back of the\nTerminal 2 train station. Wow. This is something. (loud metal scraping) I think this... (metal scraping continues) Can you hear that escalator sound? (scraping becomes intermittent) This is terrifying. There's also\nno air conditioning here. The question is  can I\nsurvive hours  potentially? No air conditioning.\nCreepy escalator sounds. Alright  that was good intel. I think I'm gonna head back\nto the massage chairs. I think I deserve that\nafter all that. That was a big walk. Alright  Ben  we've\ngone 50 miles south. It's time for the hotter colder. Yeah.\nAll this really tells us is it just makes sure that he's\nnot in that little Sendai sliver  but I think we need to know that. You can never be too safe. I am drowning in sweat. (giggles softly) It is so humid and hot out. Okay  Ben. He has said that we are hotter \nwhich is what we expected. Okay.\nBut it's just good to eliminate that\nawful little sliver. He's not in the\nsinister Sendai sliver. So there's  at this point \nI think there's only two prefectures he could really be in.\nThe— What are they  Ben? Ibaraki or Chiba. Fortunately for us \nwe're in the Tochigi Prefecture  which ends with I. So if we asked\nif his prefecture ends with the same letter as us \nif the answer is yes  it means he's in the\nIbaraki Prefecture. If the answer is no  it means\nhe's in the Chiba Prefecture. Quite interesting. Which I would say... could be compelling. Very compelling. I will say  I am scared\nabout the cards that he has. He hasn't used any cards yet  and we've been asking\na lot of questions. No  but here's the other thing. His hand at this point\nis probably full  because he hasn't played anything. So  the more questions\nwe can ask now  while his hand is full  the better. Because that's going to\nforce him to play stuff when he doesn't want to play it \nor discard stuff. So  let's learn if he's...\nwhich prefecture he's in. Okay  just got another question I haven't even had time\nto do the card for yet. I need to catch up! Okay  first... First thing I'm going to do... is... discard my five minute bonus  because that's not useful. Now... I'm going to do... Thermometer:\ndraw two  pick one. Alright  one. Two  whoop.\nCurse of the Right Turn. Curse of the right turn. For the next hour \nthe Seekers can only turn right at any street intersection. Casting cost: Discard a Curse\nand one other card. And discard two  draw three. I'm gonna keep\nCurse of the Right Turn. Alright  now let me answer... Does my prefecture end with I?\nNo. We got an answer from Sam. What's the answer?\nBen... His prefecture does not end\nwith the same letter as ours. Ooh. Which means that he is... ...there.\nIn a tiny little baby area. A little baby area. A little baby area\nfor little baby Sam. The kind of area that\na sweet little baby might be. Yeah. Mm. Sorry  sweet little baby. Sweet little baby Sam \nwe're about to go get you. I mean  there is still quite\na lot of real complexity there  but I think that some well-placed Tentacles – the debut of Tentacles \nBenjamin – might just be enough\nto narrow him down. I think you may be right. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do a combo bonus. Because I have to...\ndiscard something before I pull the card for that. So I think I'm gonna\nuse some Curses. Because there's a combo here that I think could be\nrather annoying. I wish I could wait\na little bit longer... but I can't because\nI need to draw this card. You're not allowed\nto combo all Curses. But the first one\ndoes not prevent them from asking a question\nor taking transit. So we're going to start with\nCurse of the Right Turn. And then I'm going to play Curse of the\nImpressionable Consumer. That probably means that they\nneed to go out on the streets. So I think they would just hopefully just waste a lot of time\ntrying to find this. The thing is  I do need to... In order to play this – because I need to discard\na Curse and one other card – and the Seekers'\nnext question is free. But I think it's worth a shot. I don't think the 15 minute\ntime bonus is worth much  and the Curse of the Frozen Dot... Honestly  it's tricky. But yeah  I think\nI'm gonna play this. So now I get to draw three. (jet engines passing) Airplanes. So one... two  three. Discard one  draw two \n10 minute bonus  five minute bonus. Oh  those are not great. I guess I'll keep the\ndiscard one  draw two. Alright. Hello  we've been Cursed.\nWe've been Cursed. We've been Cursed. We've been Cursed in a way that I would argue –\n– is very confusing. It's not the\nbest way to Curse us. Curse of the Right Turn. For the next hour \nthe Seekers can only turn right at any street intersection. Curse of the\nImpressionable Consumer. The Seekers must buy a product\nthat they saw an advertisement for before asking another question. This advertisement must\nbe found out in the world  not on a Seeker's device. Casting cost: The Seekers'\nnext question is free. But the first one\nonly lasts for an hour  and it prevents us from taking\nright turns when walking. Yeah. And it's like \nwe ain't walking. And then— The other one \nnot a very good— We're headed towards –\n– literally Tokyo. We're gonna be able to\nclear that in five minutes. I'd say...\nSam  Sam. This is what many\nwould call a blunder. It is crazy that we\nasked about the airports  and he's within 20 miles\nof Narita Airport. It is crazy. I mean  literally our first question\nreferenced Narita Airport. Okay  they got this\ngreat observation deck here. So that is a...\nthat's a 787 from Zipair  which is a low-cost airline that's a subsidiary of \nI think  Japan Airlines. Alright  and here's a\nVietnam Airlines A350. Way over there is an\nAsiana A330  I think. I do love how all the\nairport workers here wear hard hats. They never do that anywhere else. Oh  look at all that cargo. Wait  Ben  I just\nrealized something. Yeah? Curse of the\nImpressional Consumer means that\nour next question is free. Which means that we can\ndo a free Tentacles. Oooh  that hoits. That's gotta hoit. Oh  that hoits.\nOoh  that's gotta hoit ya. Those are the most\nexpensive questions. Oh  we get to ask the most expensive\nquestion for free. For free. ♪ Free ♪ Look  the cards\nrequire a certain... you know  panache.\nA certain skill with card games. You  the audience  you— I bet you would do\nbetter with the cards. You would definitely\ndo better with the cards. And in fact  you can do\nbetter with the cards. Because of course\nyou could buy this game. We adapted this game \nas we have mentioned  to be played wherever you live.\nMhm. Then you would do\nbetter with the cards. And you would have\nso much fun. But there's gonna be\na thing you can click on. You can click on it.\nAnd you should click on it. I don't know.\nCould be interesting. Could be very interesting. Alright. Oof. Time for massage number two. Let's check on Ben and Adam. Okay  looks like they're\ngetting close to Tokyo Station. So they've made the correct decision\njust to come to Tokyo. Once they're at Tokyo Station \nit's about an hour out to here. But they first have to figure out \nhere's the spot  of course. Sorry  it's the massage... stuff gets distracting\nin a delightful way. It's just  oh  it's finding a\nreally good spot in my back. Hooh. Alright. Alright.\nWelcome to Tokyo  Ben! Welcome back to Tokyo. Well  we got some\nCurses to deal with. We gotta find an advertisement  then we gotta buy\nwhat it's telling us. How will we possibly do that\nin Tokyo Station? It may be impossible. There's an advertisement\nfor whatever that is. They seem to\nbe advertising rice. I don't think we can buy innovating energy\ntechnology  probably. Well... So  the right turns thing\ndoesn't apply to us in the station  because it's only for streets.\nNo  it's streets. Kind of does\nnothing to us right now. It seems to be for\nsome kind of software. That doesn't work. I mean  we might want\nto pop out of the station. Yeah. Oh-oh-oh! That's an ad for a drink. Let's go up there. But remember \nwe can only turn right. Well  but this\nis still a walkway. Yeah  yeah.\nDid you get what it was? It was...\nIt was some kind of water. It'll come back. Come back. Come back  please. Ooh! Okay  I didn't have\nmy shoes off last time. And the underfoot\naction is... ticklish. But delightful. Oh.\nCoca-Cola  Coca-Cola. Alright  let's buy a Coca-Cola. We were sitting at\nthis digital billboard for 10 minutes waiting\nfor something to come up. I bet you that\nthere's Coca-Cola inside of New Days.\nYeah. ♪ New Days ♪ Wonderful. Coca-Cola secured. Alright  we have been\nimpressionable consumers. So the Curse is now clear. They have cleared their Curses. Which  to be honest \nthat didn't impede them that much  unfortunately. Now that that Curse\nis out of the way  we are going to head to Narita  and we're going to hit him\nwith some Tentacles. Tentacle time!\nAnd it's going to be free  Ben! And it's going\nto be freaking free. (sighs)\nAlright. (exhales deeply) Unfortunately  it's actually\ngoing to take a while to get there  because we're now on slow lines.\nYeah  well... The good thing is\nI think we've got him... mostly figured out at this point.\nYeah. It's a 747. Oh  look at that big boy. Oh  it's an itsy-bitsy\nJapan Airlines plane. I love that. The (bleep) is an Aero K? I've never heard of that.\nAnd I know my airplanes. I don't think that's a real airline. Aa— I'm gonna say it now.\nI don't care. I don't care when\nBen and Adam get me. I'm sitting out here \nnice little breeze. I'm sipping sake on some ice  ripping through\nsingle-use plastics... and watching some planes take off.\nThis is amazing. I love this. Okay  what I don't love... They are on basically\nthe direct route to here from Tokyo Central. It is the most intuitive way\nto get in this general direction. But  I don't love it. They might be coming here.\nThis is bad. They might be coming here. Uh-hum... Where does that line go? Oh wait  airplane. Alright  so  hello. We are here reporting from... We are at almost the middle\nof the remaining area where Sam could be hiding. And we are about\nto deploy our Tentacles. Yes  we're about to\nactivate our Tentacles tool. So Tentacles is a new tool\nthat is useful for narrowing down sort of denser  more metro-y areas. Okay  here's\nhow Tentacles work. The Seekers ask the Hider\nthe following question: That blank can be filled\nwith one of four things: zoos  aquariums \namusement parks  and metro lines. So  if there are five zoos\nwithin 15 miles of the Seekers  the Hider must say which of\nthe five they are nearest to  cutting down the potential\nhiding area by 80%. The only caveat is that\nthe Hider must also be within 15 miles of the Seekers  or the question returns\na null answer. The tool is called Tentacles\nbecause you can envision the Seekers turning all the zoos\nwithin 15 miles of them into their tentacles \nwhich feel around for the Hider until the nearest one\npings back with a hit. The key to Tentacles is\nthat it's incredibly useful for helping Seekers\nnarrow down the Hider's location in dense urban areas. In rural areas \nTentacles are useless because there will likely be\nno amusement parks  no zoos  no aquariums  and no metro lines. But in denser urban areas \nthere will be several of each. And the more there are \nthe better for the Seekers  as it means they end up with\nmore precise information. And so we are\ngoing to ask about which amusement park\nSam is closest to. There are five within\n15 miles of us. We are going to ask right... ...now. This sucks.\nThey're getting close enough that I think I gotta start\nheading to my hiding spot. Just in case  you know? I was really enjoying\nmy plane spotting. Guess who just got Tentacled? Oh  that doesn't sound right. Oh yeah  I'm definitely\nwithin 15 miles. Oops. Well  they're gonna like that. I don't like that\nthey're gonna like that. (gasps) It was a hit. Okay  he's closest—\nAlright  wait  wait  wait. He's closest to\nFantasy Kids Resort  which is actually very interesting. Because it's close to\nanother one. It's close to this one \nand it's kind of close to this one. So that gives us\nquite the limited... Oh  that's quite good. That's quite good.\n...area. Alright  this is us. Alright. Wow  it's hot here. I forgot how hot it is outside. The answer is very. They are in Narita  the city  now. Oh  that's uncomfortably close. Okay  I sure hope\nthey're getting out of the train in Narita right now...\nand going like... \"Where the (bleep)\ncould he be now?\" The area where he could be\nis pretty limited right now. But it's gonna take a minute to figure out exactly\nwhat that area is. We got a little bit of work to do. Maybe not. I don't know. One can dream. Okay  they've been in Narita\nlong enough at least to make me believe that\nthey did not stay on the train  which would have\nbrought them right here  which is great news. So now they gotta figure out where within 15 miles of\nwherever the (bleep) I am. Let me see if I can\nfollow some logic here. What angle is that?\n85 degrees. So you  the audience  this was easy for our\nmotion graphic designers. But it actually took us\nquite a while to figure out what area that meant he was in. But you can see it\nnow on the screen. It means he's somewhere in here \nin this slice. And so I believe that means that he is on\none of these two lines. How confident\ndo we feel about that? Well  could he\nnot be further east? This is the slice. So I actually don't really\nthink he could be east unless he's at the airport. Which maybe he is.\nIt'd be pretty weird. It would be an\ninteresting thing for him to do. Honestly... I think they're gonna\nguess that I'm here. Because they know now\nI'm within 15 miles of that radius  and once you think about it  you realize that the airport's\na great hiding spot. Maybe. Here's what I reckon. I think probably another\nquestion is in order. Yes.\nOne thing we could do is we could hit him\nwith a quick Radar. Just to figure out\nwithin that 15 miles  close  or is he far out?\nYeah. I'd be inclined to\ntry a little Radar. A 10 mile or a 5 mile? 5 mile  if it's a miss  would tell us he didn't\ngo to the airport. I don't think he would\nhave gone to the airport. No  that would have been\ntoo weird even for him. Back in Terminal 2. Alright  I'm gonna hang out\nhere for a while  'cause... I'm close enough\nthat I should be able to get back to the hiding spot if they start coming towards here. What do you reckon  Ben? What's annoying is \nI would love a seven. We could do our choose.\nDo you want to choose a seven? I'll do a seven if you want. Yeah  yeah \nseven just feels right. Oh  we got a 7 mile Radar. That's interesting. That's very specific. I'm tempted to use a randomize \nbecause I have two of them. 'Cause seven miles pretty cleanly kind of\ntells them here-ish. Mmm  I guess\nI'm gonna randomize it. Problem is  the thing that they\nrandomize with could be worse. But I have another randomize.\nI think I'm gonna try it. Okay  Sam's hit us\nwith a randomize. So  there are six remaining Radars. It's just gonna be\nwhat comes up on the screen. Yeah  okay.\nWe're hoping for five or six. Okay. Six.\nSix? Okay  so that's\na 10 mile Radar. That's fine.\nThat's still fine. It's a little bigger\nthan we would have liked  but it's way better\nthan if it had been... Yeah  yeah  that's\nstill somewhat useful. Alright  well... the randomize apparently\ngot 10 mile Radar. Which  almost the same thing. I'm not sure that was\nworth the powerup. That's sometimes\nhow the jets lag. Okay  finally get to\ndraw new cards again. One. Two. That is not great. Okay  a bit of\nconfusing card stuff here. I selected to draw one  and then I used it\nto draw a new card  the Curse of the Lemon Phylactery. But I couldn't fulfill its\ncasting cost of a Curse  so I discard one  draw two to discard that \nand drew two more. And draw two.\nOoh  ten minute bonus. Not bad. Ten minute bonus. Okay  well  could've\nwished for more. That's alright.\nWell  better than nothing. It is so hot here. Sort of some of the hottest we've ever seen\nin terms of heat. I'm like in a wetsuit. Well  this is a choice\nthat you made. Yeah. Okay  Ben  it's a hit. I mean  we figured\nit probably would be. So  Ben  he's\neither at the airport  up a few stops this way \nor on one of these lines. I don't hate the idea\nof getting on this line  on the local \nand asking if he— if our train would\nstop at his station. Well  do we want\nto get a photo of... something we could maybe\nrecognize before we do that? Yes. Because if we're\nriding that line— Let's ask for a photo. Of what  of... tallest building\nfrom the train station? Yeah. Or we could do\nthe train platform. No  tallest building\nfrom the train station. He sends us a picture\nof Narita Airport as the tallest building.\nHe can see that will be very funny. Well  they have asked\nthe question. Tallest building from station. Well  that's what this is for. It's gonna be another randomize. I'm just like  I don't feel\nlike I have another option. I gotta try it. The man has done\nanother randomize. That's annoying. He's hit us with\nyet another randomize. So I guess we're gonna\nget a random photo. The thing is  we can just\nask that photo again. It just means he gets a card. Okay  random number\n1 to 14. Here we go. 13. Ooh  Strava map of\na half mile walk. Okay  great. That's pretty good. I don't mind that at all. No  that's gonna be\nstill quite useful. Okay  they got a Strava map. That'll be a bit useful. Okay  my technique is that\nthere's some very unhelpful  perfectly 90 degree turns here. So I reckon I just do the\nmost generic thing possible and do a bit of a square  you know? I think that would work. So this is the local line. It's one of the two that\nwe think he could be on. I mean  you want to just\ngo sit on the train for now? Let's go get on the train. I'm gonna jaywalk. Here is turn five. This isn't great. I mean  this is going\nto be pretty notable. But... it's the best I could do. Alright  time for a new card. Curse of the Mediocre Travel Agent. Curse of the\nMediocre Travel Agent. Choose any publicly accessible place within a half mile of the\nSeekers' current location. They must go there \nspend at least 10 minutes there  and acquire a souvenir\nbefore asking another question. Casting cost:\nTheir vacation destination must be further from you\nthan their current location. Oh  this is good. Okay  we have the map. I don't know. It's gonna be hard to match that\nwith these towns. Okay  so right now we're\ntaking off on the local line. And we're gonna ask him if our train would\nstop at his station. Because we're pretty sure\nwe've narrowed it down to two lines. Yeah. Okay  they hit me\nwith a train service. And the answer's no. And that means I get\nto draw three more! One. Five minute bonus. Two. Fifteen minute bonus. Three. Discard one  draw two. Let me keep discard one  draw two.\nI think I'll play that right now. So I'm gonna discard\none ten minute bonus with a discard one  draw two and draw two more \nwhich are gonna be... Duplicate another card.\nOoh  that could be good. And 20 minute bonus.\nOh  wow  that was so worth it. Let's go. Well  this is interesting. They seem to be heading\naway from the airport. This is despite the fact\nthat I think quite soon they're going to learn that the airport would be the\nright direction to go. Okay  not the same train line. Okay  Sam is not\non this train line  which means that \nI guess we should— He's almost certainly\non the other train line then. So we need to get off\nat the next stop and we need to get to\nthe other train station. The only other thing is he could technically\nbe at the airport. Maybe he's at the damn airport? Maybe that's why he tried to\nnot answer the tallest building. Well  we should ask\ntallest building again. I am now like \nwhat if he's at the stupid airport? I mean  the thing is\nif he's at the airport  it would at least be\nobvious with this question. Yeah.\nThat is where he's at. Look  I still think\nwe're gonna be fine  but we are getting... closer to a dangerous time\nthan I would like. He certainly has been\nmilking the end of this game. Okay  so—\nOh  it's so hot. Okay  so Sam was\nnot on the local line. So we're going back. Hurry  Ben. If we can make this. Okay  great.\nBack to Narita. We're gonna go\nahead and ask Sam for a photo of the tallest\nbuilding from the station  again. It's frankly suspicious that\nhe didn't want to answer that. Yeah. And we do think there's\na chance he's at the airport. It would be funny. It wouldn't be that funny. Alright  welp \nthey hit me with the tallest building\nfrom the train station. That sucks. Well  I think it was inevitable. Can we go back to the Keisei? Yes  we have to go\nback to the Keisei line. And we have to ride\nit to the airport so that we can get on it\ngoing the other way. Alright. I've walked this\nhallway so many times. Unfortunately for me  this is definitely an\nentrance to the train station. And that control tower is\ndefinitely the tallest. (sighs)\nSo there's no way around this. Alright. I'm sending them the photo. I think they're going to love this. Ben  he's at the airport. What? Adam says\n\"mother-(bleep)-er.\" That's kind of rude. Back here. Time to sit down. Given the Curses I have on hand \nI think I might be here for a while. I think we might have him. Adam  are you sure that\nnone of these other stations have an air traffic control tower? There have been people\ncoming through this station  taking photos and stuff.\nClearly  like train enthusiasts. So  just by the way \nfor you train enthusiasts out there  the reason this station \nHigashi-Narita  is so famous is because it basically has\nno reason to still exist. It was built in 1978\nto serve the airport  but then in the '90s  they built stations\nin Terminals 1 and 2 that made it obsolete. It's also home to Japan's shortest\nindependent railway operator  Shibayama Railway Company \na company that runs a single line between this never-used station\nand an even less-used station past the airport called\nShibayama-Chiyoda  all of which is why this station tends to be filled with\nonly two kinds of people: train enthusiasts and lost tourists who accidentally transferred\nonto the wrong line. Okay.\nWhat line is it? Wait. Is it this? Yeah  we could've taken that. Wait  no  this is wrong.\nThis is the rapid line. We need to know \nbut ours is different. The local. Yeah  down there. Down there?\nIt's the local. It's on track two. Alright. It is actually worth\nconsidering though  Adam  that the airport  I think \nhas two stops. I know  that's why\nwe're getting on the local. I cannot believe he went\nto the (bleep)-ing airport. So  we know\nhe's at the airport. But where in the airport? Well  here's the thing. I have to imagine\nthat the whole reason that he hid at the airport is that he has some (bleep)-ed up\nlittle final hiding spot that he thinks is going\nto be impossible to find. But how (bleep)-ed up\ncould it be? I think it could be\npretty (bleep)-ed up. This tunnel is so spooky. This tunnel is so spooky\nthat it includes... lizards  I think? Well  they are coming in hot. I mean  here's the thing...\nis that airport is huge. It's huge. Yeah  it's a big airport. But he's gonna be in\nsome weird ass terminal. He's gonna be in\nthe private plane area terminal bull-(bleep)\nor whatever. It's the first place\nwe ever caught Sam. You know what I mean?\nWas in a private plane hangar. Roll the clip. Do we stop here? No  no  no.\nThis is before... Higashi. Well  he could be here. Narita. Could he? Could it not be?\nI don't know. A train just came through  and it just kind of pushed\nthe air just ever so slightly  even all the way up here  to make it less stagnant\nand slightly cooler. And that was delightful. So nice. Wait  is this taking us\nto the right thing? (bleep) Ben  I think this\nmight be taking us to this (bleep)-ing thing. Yeah. Hello? Turn around.\nWe went the wrong way. We went too far  it's fine. There's a weird little station. Yeah  at the airport. Ah  god damn it. Not ideal. I mean  presumably\nthis will just turn right back around.\nYeah. Okay  well \nthis is interesting and also potentially quite bad. They... They took this line. This is the only stop past here. I don't know why they\nwould have taken this line. Rather than one of the\nNarita Airport lines. That's really weird. But that means that\nthey're going to come back via this station. (bleep) Why would they have\ntaken that train? I wonder if they just messed up. I told you it's not that far. Well  but that was very...\nI'm just saying. Alright  back we go. Alright  well  the decision\nwe need to make now  because their train is\nthree minutes away  is... Do I hit him with the Travel Agent\nusing this card  or do I duplicate this card? Yeah  I guess I gotta duplicate this\n'cause the 20 minute time  this is not gonna get me\ninto first place. Yeah  okay  so let me duplicate it. I think I'm just gonna\nsend them plane spotting. To the observation deck. That's how you get\nto Terminal 2. Hopefully they notice that... and take that turn\nand don't notice me here. I'm lucky I sat on this\nside of the pillar. 'Cause honestly I didn't\nthink about it too much. And I could've sat on that side\nand I'd be completely visible. I'm not allowed to move now \nso  you know... I think I hear the train. Let's go get him. So we have no way of knowing\nwhich terminal he's in. (whispering) Okay. The train just stopped\nat the platform. I heard it. Okay  I'm gonna be\nreally quiet  really still. What has he done? We have to Travel Agent\nto Terminal 1. Okay. Should we\nget back on this or no? No.\nNo. Terminal 1? Wait here. Wait here. Okay  the train's leaving. This could be it.\nThis could be it. Walk 10 minutes.\nOkay. Okay. To here  here. Go straight  upstairs.\nThank you. (whispering)\nThat's them. I hear them.\nThen left. Okay. Thank you.\nThank you. Okay. Well  the question is \ndo we want to try and clear it? (whispering) Oh god \nI think they're coming here. Do you think it's\nworth our time to clear it? He still has to\nsend us the photo  right? Yeah.\nYeah. I think it's— Oh  hey Sam! Oh. Hi. How's it going? (wheezes) I was very stressed out.\n(cackles gleefully) Why did you take\nthat train line? By accident!\nI thought you would. You know  this is  only 1 400 people a day\nuse this train line. And the whole thing about it\nWas that your whole cool plan? Is that nobody uses it.\nNobody uses it? Yeah.\nAs your whole cool thing. I mean  in fairness to you \nthis is a crazy station. Nobody's here. You would— It took me an hour just to find the entrance\nto this station. Truly very abandoned. Yeah  there's\nnot a lot going on. Wow  that sucks for you  man. Hey  look  it was the\nsame deal for you yesterday. Yeah  wow. What also sucks\nis your best exit would have been that one. Mmm.\n(chuckles deeply) We were just wandering there. Yeah. Bye  Ben. Alright  Ben  bye! Good luck.\nGood luck. You know \nnow that I think about it  I have somewhat gifted\nthe person with the winning run  the geography that led\nto the winningest run. Yeah  you know \nI was thinking about that. It's not the best  I would say. Yeah. Should we find a nice\ncorner to sleep in? Yeah  'cause we—\n'cause that's how it works. We sleep in the place\nwhere we end  obviously. Wait  are you joking?\nWhat have you been doing?

And it really kinda\nfeels like Jet Lag except the stakes are real. Yeah  and I legit  no joke \nhave started watching his videos and I'm really in there.\nThey are legit very good. Alright.\nAnd they're on Nebula! Seamlessly segue us out\nof this to another reason. You know what? I also... You know what also can be counted\nas an addition to cards? The number of transit creators\non Jet— on Nebula. Such as Not Just Bikes  who makes video essays\nabout transit. And sort of  you know \nI've actually learned  legit I have learned a lot about\nurban design and transit design from watching that channel. I feel like now when I go to a city  and I'm like \n\"This city's vibes suck \" I know why and that's\nbecause of Not Just Bikes. Speaking of Canadians... Michael Downie. Oh  I do like Michael Downie. He goes and rides\non cool trains and Planes sometimes.\nAlso— Not very often planes. Some— He has before. I saw a video when\nhe was on a plane. Yeah  he does both.\nBut mostly trains. Sometimes he just\ngoes to Formula 1 races  which is not very trains oriented \nbut he just has a good time. Well  they're in cars \nthey're riding around. Yeah  I guess  sort of.\nAnyway  it's great. Ben  you name one. No  maybe not. Alright  Sam  before we go \nname one more travel creator. I'm gonna name you another\nCanadian travel creator. Whoa!\nThere's a lot of them. In fact  I could even\npick between two of them. RMTransit does great\ntransit more oriented stuff. Sure.\nI'm 95% sure he's Canadian. And Rare Earth.\nYeah. One of the best.\nHe goes crazy places  in his stuff. He does not have fear seemingly. That's all on Nebula. The tl;dr is\nthat's just what we— That's just travel.\nCome out of... And that's just\nthe travel we thought of. There are more travel\ncreators on Nebula. Ben  you haven't\nsaid many things. How do they sign up for this? Well  if you go into\nyour internet browser and you go ahead and\nyou type in nebula.tv/jetlag  that's gonna go ahead\nand get you 40% off  which is a treat from us. And that's also how we\nmake sure that we get paid so that we can keep\nmaking this show. And then that is  you know... If you like the show\nand you want to keep going  that's how you should do it. And I just want to emphasize \nplease use /jetlag. So many of my friends\nand family will be like  \"Hey  I signed up for Nebula\nto watch your show.\" And I'm like  \"Did you\nuse the 'jetlag' code?\" And they go  \"No.\" And so I'm like  so not only\nare you not getting 40% off  but also now we don't get—\nWe're not seeing any— We gotta get a little\nchunk of that change. We only get it if you use\n/jetlag. And now everyone is destitute. nebula.tv/jetlag. Bye."

        "transcript": "(water rushing) Playtime's over  kids. I've been carrying around\nthis ghillie suit in my bag for four days now. And I'm about to prove\nthat the only person who can hide longer than me ...is me. I'm really scared\nI'm gonna fall off this cliff. Oh my god. Hello  and welcome back\nto episode four of our six-day game of hide-and-seek across Japan. Right now  it's the\nmorning of day four  and we're at the halfway\npoint of the game. So far  each player has\nhad one round to hide  putting Ben at the top of the board\nwith just shy of a 10-hour run. With three days remaining \nwe're all expecting to get at least one more run \nso these final rounds could completely change\nthe course of the game. When we last left off \nBen and Adam caught me in Narita International Airport  giving Ben a central and\nwell-connected starting point for his second round. If he can beat his first time\nand hide for longer than 10 hours  he'll maintain his first place lead\nand set an even higher hurdle for Adam and I to beat\nif we want to win the game. So without further ado \nlet's try to find Ben. Sam  it is 7:30 \nand we gotta go  go  go. Yes  we do. There is a Narita Express\nin 10 minutes. Yeah  and I think\nwe just want to go to Tokyo Station  right? Yeah  we definitely\njust want to head straight to Tokyo Station. I mean  there is a\npotential opportunity to ask a hotter-colder  because we're going to\nbe moving immediately. Yeah  although\nI think most likely... I don't think that Ben\nis going to  you know  go into the territory\nthat we know  because... I agree. You know  the fact\nthat we've played north means that we kind of\nhave an advantage. So  I mean  I think that means\nhe's going to take the Shinkansen that goes to Niigata...\nNagano  and Ōsaka. Or  yeah. So there's kind of three options  and they all start in\nthe same direction. I think we\nneed to walk faster. What's interesting\nabout this place is that it's got some\nvery strong strengths... and it's also got some\nvery strong weaknesses. There are definitely\nsome questions that if they ask them \nI'm in big trouble. For example  if they ask for a photo of my\nlargest body of water. As you have seen \nI am near to the ocean. And so they will know that\nI'm near to the ocean  and that's going to give away\na lot of information. So  I'm hoping that\nthey don't ask that  and that at least if they do \nthey don't ask it for quite a while. Because then I'd have to  you know \nsend them something like that  and that's... That would be trouble. What car are we? Is it six?\nYeah. Alright  do we want\nto try to figure out sort of the rough limits of\nwhere he could have gotten? We could \nalthough  I don't know. I don't think it's\nreally going to help us. Yeah  I don't know if it's— we need to for the first step  yeah.\nWe just need a direction. Okay  you know\nwhat I will say  would not necessarily\nbe a bad question  just at this point... is distance from Shinkansen because we're about as\nfar from a Shinkansen as we would naturally be often.\nMhm. So  it would be\ninteresting to know. You know what I mean? If he's close to a Shinkansen  because if he's further\nfrom a Shinkansen  that would cut down\nthe map a lot. You know what else could be kind of an interesting\nquestion to ask  just for what it's worth? Is if his distance from a major city\nis greater or lower than ours. 'Cause if it's lower \nthen it's like  well  he's in a major metro area. And if it isn't  then it's like \nwe can exclude quite a bit. I guess we could ask that  and then we could ask\nthe Shinkansen thing. Yeah  but even if we\nasked both those things  we wouldn't have a direction.\nNo  we wouldn't  but those would be two\nuseful questions to ask now. I could— How about that?\nOkay  yeah  let's do that. Let's do it\nwhile they're useful. Okay  alright. I'm gonna have to draw\na lot of circles. This... stupid\nghillie suit is too hot. I am...\nI have gotta take this off. Look  we'll bring it back out\nin a little bit. But I do not need it right now. Oh. We got our first question. Distance from major city. I am further than 29 miles\nfrom a major city. There is still much of the\ngreater Tokyo area to explore. And I hope that they waste\nas much time there as possible. Now that they have asked me\nwhether I am closer to a major city  I get to look at\nthe top three cards. Curse of the Unguided Tourist. Curse of the Unguided Tourist. Send the seekers an unzoomed\nGoogle Street View image from a street within 500 feet\nof where they are now. Without using the\ninternet for research  they must find what you\nsent them in real life before they can use transportation\nor ask another question. 20 minute bonus. Discard one  draw two. Honestly  I think that all in all  we might be overvaluing\nCurses a little bit. Because thus far \nI did have that one Curse on them that seemed to really kill them. But honestly  I got\nquite lucky with that. And all the other Curses\nhave been pretty clearable. Certainly  I think a 20 minute bonus\nis better than... ...a meh Curse. Okay  he is further. So now we're going to\ndraw all of our circles. So Adam  best I can tell \nbased on schedules... he could not have made it either onto this line\nor onto this line. Meaning  basically  if he didn't take this Shinkansen  we can exclude all of this.\nOkay  well that's good. So would we want to\nask closest Shinkansen? Well  do we want to first ask if his distance from a Shinkansen\nis greater or lower than ours? Because we're\n20 miles out now  right? Yeah  do we have enough time\nto do both if we want to? Yeah  yeah  I think so. Well  I mean  yeah \nwe could do close to Shinkansen now. I mean  20 miles or so\nis fairly useful  I think. Hit it? Yeah  yeah  hit it. Alright  team. Team Ben. We've got another\nquestion from the boys. They've asked us the question \nare we closer or are we further to a Shinkansen line\nthan they are? And they are 21 miles from one. I'm closer. I don't know if that's what\nthey wanna hear or not. Eh  they still don't have\na direction to go  but they're getting\nthe map down quick. Okay  well  it's\nanother top three peek. And let's just hope we get ourselves\nmaybe a solid Curse or a big time bonus or something. Curse of the Bridge Troll. The Seekers must\nask their next question from under a bridge. Casting cost: The Seekers must be\nat least 50 miles from you. A 15 minute bonus \nand a 10 minute bonus. Now  Curse of the Bridge Troll  that is not going\nto be hard for them to do where they are. And it does— It tells them that they are at least\n50 miles from me. So that's gonna draw—\nThat basically gives them a free 50 mile Radar. So I'm just gonna take\na 15 minute bonus  and I don't know.\nYeah  we're going kinda— We're going time bonus\nstrategy this time. Maybe that'll work.\nI have no freakin' clue. Let's go into town. Maybe we can find somewhere\nthat is not so hot so that I can stop sweating. Or at the very least \nI can find a fluid to put in my body so that I can produce more sweat\nand not die. (claps) Let's go. Hey  Adam.\nYes? The answer is... Closer. That'll probably be useful.\nYeah. Let's try to figure out\nhow to mark this. It's not gonna be easy. Here's what I think we need to know. We're about to get to Tokyo Station. Do we go up to Ōmiya? Or do we go west?\nYou know what I mean? Because these all start\nby going to Ōmiya. Yeah. So I think that's\nwhat we need to figure out. So we just need a question\nthat cuts this off  or these off. It looks like\non the airport map  so we're actually now\ncloser to Haneda Airport. Yeah. So it would draw a nice\nstraight line up to Niigata  which would split the region. And the thing is \nthere's a lot of likely territory that would be closest to Haneda. So if we hit it... we would know at least\nwe could head up to... what is it called  Takasaki? Well  if we know\nhe's on one of these  yeah  we could go up to Takasaki \nwhich would be really nice. I kinda dig... Let's try it. Let's try it.\n...airport. Yeah?\nYeah  yeah. Okay. We have reached the town. I don't really know\nanything about this town. The one thing I did see on the map\nis that there's a teddy bear museum. So that's pretty exciting. Oh man  we got another\nquestion from them. They're asking if my... closest major international airport\nis the same as theirs. Theirs is Haneda. And unfortunately  mine is too. (chuckles) That's really gonna\nnarrow it down. Which  you know  isn't great. The amount of information\nthat they have gathered in a very  very\nshort period of time. Well  I guess I'll let them know. I think at this point \nwe are really relying on them to make a big mistake. 'Cause I don't know exactly what\ntheir map looks like right now  but it has gotta be pretty small. But anyway  I answered their\nairport questions  so... Let's look at our top three. It's a 15 minute bonus \na 10 minute bonus  and a Curse of the Jammed Door. Curse of the Jammed Door. For the next three hours \nthe Seekers must roll dice to pass through a doorway. Casting cost: Discard a card. A 15 minute bonus is nice. But I think that I gotta try\nthe Curse of the Jammed Door again. I mean  last time \nit bought me hours. Hours. Man  they are going to be... very  very happy when they learn that my\nnearest airport is the same. Oh  dear. Same  it's a hit. Hohohohohoho! Benjamin Doyle. Do you think we can\nwrap this up by noon? Hoo-hoo-hoo! Oh  Benny boy. That  I mean  look \nwe're not even on— We don't even—\nLet's just fold this guy up. I don't even need to\nlook at the rest of this. We're not even close to\ndone with our first train  and we've got it down\nto one fold on the map. Or really a half fold.\nHe is in here  or in here. Technically \nthat would be annoying. That would be annoying. My best guess right now is that he's somewhere\naround Nagano. Yeah  I would agree with that. I think we want to definitely\nget on a Shinkansen. Yeah. And let's head\nkind of west  northwest. Yeah  let's just\nget into our likely zone. Yeah. And then once we're\ngetting up there  we can do a hotter-colder\nto cut off and make sure he isn't down here \nwhere he might be. Yeah. And if he is  we can backtrack \nand it won't be that bad. But I think high likelihood\nhe's up here. Yes  almost certainly. Yeah  I mean  it would be lucky if he was down there\nfor him  basically. Yeah  it would be\npretty lucky  but it would also not be that bad.\nWe could just head over there. Yeah  I mean \nit's on the Shinkansen. And honestly  there's not\nthat much around there. No. There is some good\nviews of Mount Fuji  which maybe he's into. I mean  I would say\nthat it would be... Well  you know what? You want to ask for a view of the tallest mountain\nthat he can see? From his station?\nAnd just check if it's Mount Fuji? Photos are cheap  yeah. I mean  we might as well\nask a photo while we're at it.\nJust  might as well. Sure. The station is\npretty cool looking. It's got this little\nplaza in the middle. And as you can see \nit's completely empty. Okay  so they've asked\nfor a picture of the tallest mountain\nvisible from the station. I mean... The fact of the matter\nis that I'm not really... I wouldn't say that\nI'm in the mountains. So I don't know if this is really\ngoing to be all that helpful. I believe the tallest mountain\nvisible from the station is... (clicks tongue)\n...right up there. I went all around the station  and I think that's\nthe tallest one I can see. Yeah. Yeah. I'm hoping that... you know  because\nI can see a mountain  I'm hoping that they\nkind of conclude  you know  \"Oh  he's in the mountains?\" Because if you look at\nmy station on a map  it doesn't really scream\n'in the mountains'. You might not think\n'in the mountains'. So I'm hoping that this at least sort of directs\ntheir attention elsewhere. Alright  let's sit down\nand draw ourselves a card. It's a randomize question. Hmm. I don't know if I really\nwant to discard that to play\nCurse of the Jammed Door. That Curse is better when they're...\nin a less dense area. And right now  they are  you know \nsmack dab in the middle of Tokyo. Yeah  it looks like they're just... maybe just getting\ninto Tokyo Station now. (grunts) The Shinkansen just\nleft two minutes late. I know. I have been waiting for\nthe news story about it. Well  Sam  we are on our way...\nup on the Shinkansen. And Ben has sent us\na picture of a mountain. It's not Mount Fuji. It certainly does not\nlook like Mount Fuji. To be honest  it only makes me think of\nNagano more  because... It has huge Nagano vibes.\nThe geography of Nagano... it seems actually quite similar\nto his first hiding spot  where there's a lot of these\nkind of narrow valleys  with cool onsen towns\nquite close to it. And this kind of looks like...\nI mean you can see here. It just shows these\nkind of lumpy rolling hills. Yeah. It would seem that Adam and Sam\nhave boarded the Shinkansen... north towards Nagano. And  whether or not I'm in Nagano \nI will leave a mystery. You know  they really\ndon't mess around with the bamboo out here.\nI mean  this is like a... This is like a chunky...\n(knocking) It's like metal. Look how thick this guy is. This is crazy. (knocking) Listen to that.\nThat's a solid piece of bamboo. I kind of understand\nwhy so much of the —Oh! Oh  something dropped\non me. Oh my god. Okay  so \na slight change of plans. Yeah  we realized\nthat it'd be awfully useful if we could just stay on this train\nand go to Nagano. Exactly. So we're just gonna ask\nif his nearest Shinkansen line is the same as our\nnearest Shinkansen line. There's a little bit of weirdness in that the Jōetsu and\nthe Hokuriku Shinkansens run on the same little part\nthat we're showing on the map. But we are on the Hokuriku line \nso that would be the closest. Mhm. So let's—\nOkay  send it? Yeah  I think\nwe should hit it. Hit it. Oof  okay. Sam and Adam have asked me\nwhether my nearest Shinkansen is the same as their\nnearest Shinkansen  and the answer is... Just kidding! Randomize. Pew! We're hitting them\nwith the randomize. I do think that this question\nis going to tell them a lot. And so I think that it is\nworth the randomize. Because they're probably\ngoing to ask it again  and I would like to stall. And I just do not want them\nto know that information  and so I would like to delay it\nas long as possible. We got a randomize. Well  he has\nrandomized the question. It sure looks suspicious. I mean  I will tell you  yesterday \nI used the randomize  and I didn't like\nwhat was being asked. Yeah  okay  well  let's see... what we end up\nasking him  shall we? Random number \none to ten. Two.\nTwo. Is your train service\nthe same? Well  it's almost certainly not \nunless he's on the Shinkansen. So it randomized into\nthe train service question  which is actually really good  because that question is\ntotally useless right now. No  I am not off of that Shinkansen. But it is useful later \nand now they have already asked it. So they could ask it again later \nbut for double the price. Let's go ahead and tell them\nthat I am not on a Shinkansen. Oh  shocker  no.\nHe's not on our train line  great. I think we just ask it again. It's the best question.\nYeah  I agree. And  you know \nit's at the original cost. Yeah  yeah \nbecause it doesn't count as us having asked that question.\nOkay  well  we'll ask it again. But now he gets basically\ntwo really good card pulls instead of one for having\nanswered that question. Because he got that one\nbasically for free. Yeah. It's gotta be the same. Well  but maybe...\nFake out? Well  what I'm like is like \nmaybe he is down here  and he wanted to make us\nkeep going in the wrong direction as long as possible. Maybe.\nYou know? And  of course... now that I've answered that very useless question of theirs \nI get to look at the top three  draw one  pretty good. Five minute bonus.\nCurse of the Cairn. Curse of the Cairn. You have one attempt\nto stack as many rocks on top of each other\nas you can in a freestanding tower. Once your tower falls  the Seekers must\nconstruct a rock tower of the same number of rocks\nbefore asking another question. Or a ten minute bonus. I do like Curse of the Cairn. If I really take some time\nto stack some rocks  I feel like I could get a really... nice and tall rock tower. They've asked\nthe same question again. Am I near that Shinkansen? No  I am not near that Shinkansen.\nYou know what I am near? I'm near the teddy bear museum. The teddy bear museum. Before we go into the\nteddy bear museum  one last order of business \nwhich is to... draw one more card off of the\nnearest Shinkansen question. Okay  look at the top three.\nFive minute bonus. Veto question.\nDiscard two  draw three. Go ahead and keep that veto.\nMight be useful down the line. Oh my god  it's already so cute. They got the\nTeddy Garden cookie factory  and they've got the museum. Okay  this is my favorite place\nin the whole world. Welcome to the Teddy Bear Museum. They have a lot of teddy bears here\nis one of my first observations. (gasps)\n(classical music playback) No.\nNo. Well... Well  look \nthat's good to know. It is. So we should\nget off at Takasaki. Yeah. Okay  here's what\nI think we should do now. Thermometer. Thermometer.\nYeah. Because then  we'll have it\ndown to the two Shinkansens. Yeah  okay.\nWe start it... Probably  ASAP.\nOh yeah  we're not that far. We might  honestly  for time \nwe might need to use our 5. Do we?\nBecause it's only 25 miles  and we need the time\nfor a response. Okay  okay  okay  okay.\nWe gotta do it now. Let's start the 5. (scoffs)\nThey keep asking me questions. Stop asking me questions. I just want to enjoy\nthe Teddy Bear Museum. They've started a Thermometer. Okay. It's fine  it's fine. Okay. These teddy bears are\nmaking teddy bears. Which I feel like has some\ncomplicated... implications. I guess we're probably\nnot supposed to be thinking about that so much\nat the Teddy Bear Museum. I think it's fine for teddy bears\nto make other teddy bears. Oh. They're giving this bear an MRI. The MRI machine is broken. That bear is going to die\nfrom a horrible disease. So is this angle even\ngoing to do it  for sure? Oh  I guess  maybe not. Oh  yeah  that's not\nquite going to get there. But I think we\njust need to end this. Okay.\nBecause of... Because it won't\nchange meaningfully. Okay  okay.\nWe need five minutes or so. We shouldn't have\ndone that Thermometer  because actually we're getting\noff of Takasaki anyway. Yeah.\nThat was silly. Oh  they have a giant Catbus. They have a giant Catbus. I have no idea how much\nSam and Adam have me narrowed down at this point. We're early in the day.\nWe're early in the day. We do gotta waste\nmore of their time. I'm thinking that we do... We wanna play Curse of the Cairn...\nas soon as we can. And the Jammed Door\nCurse. Okay. They finished their Thermometer.\nWhere'd they go? Their Thermometer was colder  but I think it's\nactually really close. Which is good  'cause it's like  you want to be right on\nthe edge of those lines. Cause it's gonna make them not quite sure\nwhich direction to go. We coulda done better.\nWe shoulda waited. If we had waited  we coulda\ngotten a better line. Well  Ben says colder. Which is quite the\ninteresting answer. That kind of implies to me that maybe he's in\nShin-Fuji or something. 'Cause that's a...\nTheoretically that... It's a tiny area\nwith almost nothing in it. I mean  okay  we need to\nstart getting accurate about a lot of our lines here.\nYeah. I mean  probably the\nlevel of accuracy that requires more phone stuff. Yeah  okay. Well  we need\nto get off anyway. We need to get off\nand turn around  it would seem. I mean  this is\nkind of that phase where it's like \ndid we (bleep) up? Or do we have it narrowed\ndown quite a lot? Should we just look\nfor the nearest... for the soonest back to Tokyo  or... Probably  right? I mean  at this point  maybe. Honestly  maybe\nwe should do a Radar just to double check\nthat he's not... Yeah  radar could be useful.\nYou know what I mean? A 50 mile Radar\neven would be smart. Yeah  maybe. Let's focus on getting\noff this train and... Yeah  okay  okay.\nThat is a crazy answer. That might mean that\nhe's at Mount Fuji or near Mount Fuji.\nYeah. Okay. We're leaving\nthe Teddy Bear Museum. We had good fun.\nWe are enriched. We had a lovely time.\nBut now  it's down to business. I get to draw... two cards off of that Thermometer. Let's take a look-see. Okay  top two. Curse the Endless Tumble. Curse of the Endless Tumble. Seekers must roll a die\nat least 100 feet and have it land on 5 or 6 before they can ask\nanother question. Casting cost: Roll a die. If it's a 5 or a 6 \nthis card has no effect. Curse of Spotty Memory. Curse of Spotty Memory. For the rest of your run \none random category of questions will be disabled at all times. Casting cost: Discard a time bonus. Two Curses. Curse of the Endless Tumble \nit's okay. That might be\nkind of annoying for them. Or Curse of the Spotty Memory. I don't see that\nbeing that annoying  and you have to discard\na time bonus to do that  so... I'm going to take the other one\nand I'm just going to try it now. That's crazy. In my mind that was\njust a double check. Yeah. It was like \nwell let's just make sure. But I suppose that's\nwhy you double check. Three minutes to\nmake this connection. Okay. Was this the third round in a row\nthat people have started off by going the wrong way?\nYep. I mean the thing is... If we were right\nabout our work... we've actually\nnarrowed it down a ton. Right  unless we're wrong. We actually have an\nextremely tight area. Yeah. I think we should do\na 50 mile Radar just to make sure that... we haven't (bleep)-ed up\nsomehow or something. And also to eliminate the tiny area\nthat could still be around here. 'Cause then we have\na very precise area to head to. I think so. Yeah  I think\nthat would cover it. Should we hit it?\nYeah  we should hit it. Oh? They've just done a Radar. Okay  let's do this first \nand then we'll deal with that Radar. Okay  so we roll a die. And we gotta roll a 1  2  3  or 4\nfor it to take effect. Alright... got it. So  let's go ahead and\nhit 'em with the Curse. Of the Endless Tumble. Okay  now we've hit 'em\nwith that Curse  they've asked a 50 mile Radar. It's a miss. So  we'll let them know about that \nand we'll draw another two cards. They're asking a lot of questions. Curse of the Luxury Car. Curse of the Luxury Car.\nTake a photo of a car. The seekers must take a photo\nof a more expensive car before asking another question. Or a 10 minute bonus. Fact of the matter is  I'm not gonna find\nan expensive car out here. It's not gonna happen. So  I'm taking the 10 minute\nbonus for now  but maybe... that's gonna be sort of\ngood discard fodder for the Jammed Door Curse later. Okay. Sorry  that was complicated.\nWe're all good now. They got a Curse on them \nso it's gonna take them a minute. While they deal with that... Let's go find some rocks\nto set up our next Curse. The... The Curse of the Cairn. Miss  okay.\nIt's a miss. So that's gotta mean... that he's down there.\nI mean  again... correct me if I'm getting\nanything wrong here. No  that sounds right.\nBut I think this is alright. Which means he has to be\nin this tiny area here. Well  the line being\nthat close to Shin-Fuji could be influential. Because... I think he's in Itō.\nI'm putting him  I guess  now. I think he's in Itō\ndown by the beach. It's going to be fun to have\nall the footage of us going  \"Well  there's— He's definitely\nnot down there  though. What are the odds\nthat he's down there?\" I wonder if we want to ask\nsome more photos while we're at it. Because...\nMaybe. The one thing\nabout photos is just... it's good to ruminate on them. You know what\nI actually want to ask? Mhm? I kind of want to ask\nbiggest body of water. Because a lot of these are... Oop  Curse of the Endless Tumble. That's really\nnot a very good curse. Curse of the Endless Tumble. Seekers must roll a die\nat least 100 feet and have it land on a 5 or 6 before they can ask\nanother question. The die must roll\nthe full distance  unaided  using only the momentum\nfrom the initial throw and gravity to travel the 100 feet. If the Seekers accidentally\nhit someone with the die  the Hider is awarded\na 15 minute bonus. No. Roll a die\nat least 100 feet. Oh  I guess we can't\nreally do that on a train. No  that's the\nonly thing about it. But  at this point  we could just head\nall the way to Shin-Fuji. Yeah  yeah \nlet's just go ahead and get over there  I guess. I mean  if we're\nconfident about our work... there's not much we need\nto know before we get there. Okay  then let's\njust make the connection and get over there.\nYeah. Ugh. Here's my plan. When Sam and Adam\ncomplete this Curse  I want to hit 'em\nwith a double whammy. First  I'm gonna start\nthe Jammed Door Curse. Then  I'm gonna hit 'em\nwith Curse of the Cairn. So that they gotta go out\nand build a rock tower. And them having to go\nout and about with the Jammed Door Curse is\nnot only gonna make it possible that they get locked out of\na train or a train station  but that they get locked out of any number of places\nthat they're trying to go  while they try and clear\nthis other Curse. They're doing quite well. We're only about three hours in  and I think they've got\nmy area pretty small. So  I need this\ncombination of Curses to really slow them down. Time will tell. Alright. There should be one\nleaving in seven minutes. Okay. So get off at...\nDoes this stop at Atami? Oh  I guess this\ndoes stop at Atami. Oh  yeah. Get off at Atami then  maybe.\nI guess Atami makes sense. It has the vibe\nof where he would go. Yeah  it's a strong\nleading option  I agree. So  okay  get off at Atami?\nYeah  I think so. Oh  god  oh. They're going all the way\ndown to Atami. This is not good for me  okay? That is not good. From Atami  it does not\ntake that long to get to me. I'm really relying on these Curses\nto save me at this point. I just need them to clear\nthis die rolling Curse first. As soon as they do it  you know  I've got two Curses\nto hit them with. Two good Curses\nto hit them with. But... They're getting awfully close. Adam. Adam.\nYeah? If you look out the window... the mountain type stuff\naround here definitely matches his photo. Kind of in shape. Let's see if we can... Yeah  totally.\nSee this kind of stuff? Yeah  for sure. It's the same tree type. Definitely. Oh  I'm so sweaty. Ohh. And I can't leave the woods.\nI can't leave the woods. I've gotta be here. Because when\nthey clear this Curse  I need to be able to\nbuild a rock tower. And this is where I gotta be\nto build a rock tower. Because where are the rocks?\nThey're here. The rock tower.\nThe rock tower is my only hope. They're almost to Atami Station.\nWhat's going on? What's going on?\nWe need an update. Where are you  Adam Chase?\nWhere are you  Sam Denby? It's toasty! Yeah. We need to find a\nbig  nice  open space. Yes.\nFlat  open  et cetera. Well  because\nwe need to make sure we don't hit anyone.\nYeah. I mean  ideally \nwe want an incline. Yeah. Before we roll  and as we search  we should probably\nprep our next question. So that we can ask it\nbefore he Curses us again. I agree  I mean... This is not bad. Yeah. Actually  let's\ncross the street there. Okay. I would say that I'm torn between\nwe could do a Radar... but again  that wouldn't\ngive us a direction. I kinda want a picture of\nhis biggest body of water  because I think whether\nor not it's the ocean  it'll tell us if he's on the coast.\nYeah  but honestly  so much of it is\nthe ocean anyways. Well  not really  though.\nI mean  look. There's this whole line\nthat isn't on the ocean that he could be on. There's this line that\nisn't on the ocean that he could be on.\nAre you looking? Yeah  I saw.\nThere's three main lines. But then there's sort of\nthree that are in the ocean  so it kinda cuts things in half. I mean  the only thing I\ndon't like about coastal is that... I strongly agree that I think\nhe's on a coastal route. And therefore  I think\nit's going to be... confirming what we largely suspect. It's fine.\nI mean  no. If you like ocean \nI think we can do ocean. I worry that it might be a little inefficient\nas a question  but... I mean  I guess\nit would be like  if we don't ask ocean \nwhat do we ask? I mean  I always like\nStrava map. Yeah  but I mean  look \nall of these towns. They have too many roads.\nOkay  fine  let's do ocean. Okay  but we\nhave to do this first. I believe  based on\ntheir movements on the map  that they are trying\nto clear the Curse that I Cursed them with. I don't know. I guess I just hope\nit takes a long time. I hope they're struggling. I hope they're cursing. I hope they're arguing. I hope they decide to\nsabotage each other over how dramatic\na disagreement they're having over this Curse is. But probably not.\nIt's probably a pretty easy one. They have  at least this season \nhad pretty bad luck with dice. So that's kinda what\nI'm going off of. I'm just hoping that\nthe dice are not rolling in their favor this season. That's 100? That's what it says. I mean  I— Okay.\nWell  let's try it. Ah. So that went\nstraight into the road. Yeah  that just\nbounced right out. This might be trickier\nthan I expected. I think we might\nneed to find an incline. Maybe. We might need to go\nto a park or something. Let's look at\nthat street up there. Alright  ready?\nYep. Didn't make it there.\nI'm gonna try again. Oh  that's not bad. Not bad. It's in the street. Uh-oh. It doesn't feel like\nit's gonna work. I kinda think we might\nneed to switch to grass. I mean  that would work great \nbut I think cars use it quite a lot. Yeah. Eh... I don't know  I mean—\nIt's possible. There's not a lot of\npeople on the road. We try it while\nthere's no cars. Let me go down there. Okay  go for it. Ready?\nYep. Oh  come on  come on \ncome on. Oh  nope. Didn't make it. That went far enough. Nope. Not far enough. This is definitely taking\nlonger than I thought it would. Not ideal. You know \nI can't say for sure... but it appears on the map like they are struggling a lot. I can't be sure about this. But it does seem like they may not be\nhaving the best time. Is that true? Ooh  that is just far enough. Nope. Nope. Really?! Yeah  this is tough luck. Come on! It's a good roll \nit's a good roll. Come on! Oh  it went down. No? It was— It's good. Can you see it? It's good. It's down the grate  but good. Wait  we got it?\nYeah. Ho-hoay! No cars. Okay.\nOkay  so really quickly. Curse cleared. Well  we have to tell Ben\nthat we've cleared it  and then we will ask... for the photo of\nthe biggest body of water. Alright  you texting? Okay  the time has come. They have cleared their Curse \nand they've asked for a photo of my biggest body of water. So here's what I'm gonna do. First things first \nI'm vetoing that question. I ain't sending them that picture. That is just  it's gonna give away\nway too much information. Second thing  I'm hitting them\nwith the Jammed Door Curse. They're moving around too easy.\nIt's time to jam those doors. And finally  it is time\nto build the rock tower. I do not know how much\nthat is going to delay them  but I feel like if I build\na really good rock tower... then... Oh my god  there's a\nlittle worm flying around. Is he attached to me? Alright  well  Ben... Oh  we got Cursed again. Curse of the Jammed Door. Curse of the Jammed Door. For the next three hours  whenever the Seekers want\nto pass through a doorway into a building  business \ntrain  or other vehicle  they must first roll two dice. If they do not roll seven or higher \nthey cannot enter that space. Any given doorway can be\nreattempted after 15 minutes. Thank god we just\nwalked into the train station. Oh  yeah. We'll  of course \nhave to roll to get on a train. Yeah  in the last\nthree hours  again? The next three hours.\nLet's find somewhere to sit down. We're about to get the picture  and we need to figure out\nwhat to do after that. Yep. My guess is that\nhe cast that just now because the photo is\ngoing to be of the ocean. Yeah.\nAnd he knows that's damning. Yep  it definitely is. Yeah  because I think at that point \nour choice is basically  do we go down or do we go across?\nYeah. This is the Itō Line  by the way.\nOh yeah. We could just\nroll for it right now. I mean  we could.\nI don't hate it. I mean  we might as well do it.\nWanna just do it? Yeah.\nAlright  here you go. What am I rolling for?\nSeven or more. Three and three. Not quite. So we're not\ngetting this conversion. Okay  well  you know \nit's interesting that we checked. Yeah. Ohh  he vetoed.\nHe's vetoed. What's the penalty\nof that again? If we ask it again \nit would cost double. Let's... I think maybe Strava map. You wanna Strava map him? I mean  I feel like if he's on\none of these stations... Yeah.\nThere's only one  two  three  four. Yeah  let's Strava map him.\nLet's see what we learn. Let's make him run around. Because we have to sit\naround for a while anyway before we can\ndo much  I think. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good solid base. Alright. Rock number two. I feel like this might\nsort of fit well. Gonna have to get a little smaller. Okay. Rock number four. Okay. I like the flatness of this one.\nOoh  yeah. It's a little risky \nbut I think it could... I think it could be a big win. Nope  okay. That's nine. That is nine. I mean  right now \nI think they're thinking  \"Oh man  this Jammed Door Curse.\nSo annoying.\" Well  just wait until they hear that they have to build a tower\nthat is nine rocks tall. They've asked for the Strava map. So that's the last question\nthat they're getting before they get hit with\nthe Curse of the rock tower. We've been Cursed. Sam  we have been hit\nwith the Curse of the Cairn! Curse of the Cairn. The Seekers must\nconstruct a rock tower of the same number of rocks\nas the one the Hider built before asking another question. Yep  and... He got nine. Which feels like a lot. I do feel like\nthat feels like a lot. Okay  should we go\nand try to clear this? Because here's the thing. If we leave the station  we'll have to roll to\nget back in the station. I think we should at least wait to get the Strava map.\nSure. Because maybe we can\nconfirm it on the Strava map. Sure. And then just get on the\nnext train after this one. And then do it wherever he is because we know he did it there.\nWhere we know there are rocks. Because I don't think\nthere are going to be very good rocks around here.\nBecause it's very urban. Yeah. Okay  okay. Alright  I'll wait. Okay. Starting the Strava map. I think I'm gonna try and go\nin a big circle  more or less. Okay. I think... that is it. Hopefully  they don't figure it out. Eh. Alright  we have\nour Strava map. It is... It does not scream\ndense place. No.\nI'll tell you that. Especially when you\nconsider that that's a half mile. Yeah  I mean \nthese places are big enough that Strava's not easy. I don't know  I don't know if we're\ngonna get it on the Strava map. Yeah  seems unlikely. Amusement—\nThere are quite a number of amusement parks around here. Mhm.\nJust saying. I think that... Tentacles  Sam  would\nnot be crazy at all. Yeah. (sighs) We might have to start\nlooking for some rocks. Okay  it looks like they... they did not get on\nthat next train to me. Which is good.\nIt either means... they got screwed by a Curse  or...\nthey don't yet know where I am. At least not confidently enough\nto get on a train  but... They could still get here\nin a little over an hour if they figure it out  so... I'm gonna keep looking\nfor a hiding spot. I'm kind of just wandering around\nlooking for something that is as boring as I can find. And that is...\na surprisingly difficult task. Keep your eyes peeled\nif we pass anywhere that's got some good rocks. You sure it's this way?\nIt says this way. I'm walking towards\nwhat looks like a bunch of rocks on the beach\nin the satellite. Oh  here's some rocks. No  definitely not enough.\nOkay. Well  oh  there's more here. I don't think this is enough.\nWell  you want to try? Well  that's barely nine. Let's try real quick. I guess.\nGive— Hold the camera. Let me have two minutes. Here  hold this.\nJust let me cook. Two. Three. Four. That's five. There are a bunch\nof rocks over there. Rocks over here?\nYeah. Yeah  yeah  we\ncan grab a few of these. Put them back. Yeah  I mean \nyou need something flatter. For the top one?\nYeah. There we go.\nThree more. One  two  three \nfour  five  six  right? If we start going to smaller rocks \nI think we could really get there. Yeah. Seven. Oh. Seven.\nIt's really unstable. I know  but we can just do\nteeny baby ones now. That's true.\nRight? It's so—\nMake sure to support it as— I'd say support it\nas you put it on. Okay. This— Is this a rock? I think that's wood. That's a rock. This is a rock for sure. Do we need to\nbeat it or equal it? We have to just equal it. One  two  three \nfour  five. Nine rocks.\nOkay  there we go. Cuh  cuh  yeah?\nNo  that was good. Did— did you—\nYou didn't believe me that I could do the rocks? Questioned me from\nthe moment we started? I mean... I think that we... We've cleared it and now\nI think we do a Tentacles. And I think we probably do it\nwith amusement parks. I mean \nfeel free to hit it quick because I want to get first. I'm going to do\namusement park Tentacles. Okay  let's head back\nto the train station so that we can start rolling\nand try to get in. Okay  oh my goodness. They've just cleared their... the Curse of the Cairn.\nGood rock stacking  boys. Very  very efficient. More efficient than\nI would have liked. But then they've gone ahead\nand deployed a Tentacles on me. An amusement park Tentacles.\nAnd what's interesting about that... is that I am just outside of the 15 mile range of\nthat Tentacles  which... is either going to\nconfuse them a lot if they were assuming I was\ndefinitely within that 15 miles  or if they've done\ntheir work correctly... they'll know exactly where I am. Which is not great. Hopefully  it at least\nscares them a little bit  because maybe they'll think\nthey've made a mistake. There's a chance\nthey've made a mistake  or I'm here. But they have wasted a\ndecent amount of time  they have missed quite\na few trains to me  and I don't think that\nthey're going to be able to get here until 3-ish now. I also now get to... look at the top four cards\nand draw two  which is real big. That's a lot of cards. 15 minute bonus.\n30 minute bonus. Discard two  draw three.\nDiscard one  draw two. So  honestly \n45 free minutes is awesome. Anyway  they now probably\nknow exactly where I am. So  let's keep looking\nfor a hiding place. Adam  do we want to consider planning a next question\nfor as soon as he responds  in case he's gonna follow up with a Curse that he maybe\njust pulled or something? It's possible. I think between this and the Strava \nI think we might be able to find it. Well  yeah  but we have\nalready looked at those lines. I guess. I feel like we'd at\nleast want a photo  right? Maybe.\nI mean  at least with... Ben is not within\n15 miles of us  Sam. Oh boy  that's not good. Well  I mean  that\nnarrows things down. I guess let's look at what's not within\n15 miles of here  but still. It's pretty limited. Alright  here we go  ready? Hey!\nThere we go. First time. Okay  well \nnot within 15 miles is... Probably.\nSure interesting. I mean  it's probably\nquite helpful. Yeah  we just have to sit down\nand figure out what it means. Yeah  just... I'm worried that maybe we've\njust missed something massively. We should also assume that the lines we've drawn\nare slightly off. Yes. Okay. So what does that mean? So it basically\nmeans he's not south. 'Cause combining 15 miles with the furthest\nhe could have gotten... Yeah.\nYou know. He could not be on\nthe line to Itō. I'm starting to think the only thing\nhe could be on is this. Yeah  we probably need to—\nYeah  that line looks plausible. What's he at right now? Time wise? Six and a half hours.\nYeah. But that's not\nincluding time bonuses. Yeah  so to be confident \nwe probably need to get him in the next two hours or so.\nWe need to— Yeah  we need to get cooking here. I mean  is it— Do we—\nIs there any sense in moving? Oh  there's one in...\n(bleep) two minutes. To where? To the direction we want to go.\nOkay  well  let's try it. Okay  we're gonna\nhave to roll for it. Yep. Here's my guess as to what is happening\nright now. I think that Sam and Adam\nhave me pegged down to one station  and it's this one. And they can't quite... work up the gumption\nto come here because they haven't\nyet confirmed it. They only have all of the... pieces of data pointing at it. But they don't have a thing\nthat they can just look at and be like \nthat's definitely the place. And if they can't... well  then they might just\nhave to take a gamble. I don't know. Here  quickly roll for it.\nYeah. No  can't even get on it.\nSo it doesn't matter. Oh  well there's\none 2:13 on this way. Platform 3. Okay  well let's\ngo roll for that. It's just that one. Alright. Five  six  that's an 11.\nShould we get on? Yeah.\nAlright. So... I feel like right now... we gotta ask a photo\nor something. I'm not convinced\nthe photo's gonna get us much. I mean  they often— It's always— It's often\na situation where it's not the direct thing\nthey get you. It's the indirect thing. Let's do tallest building\nfrom the train station  'cause that's always\na good one to have for when we go through\nhis station eventually. Send it?\nYeah. Ugh. They want the tallest building\nfrom the train station. Will this give it away? I do not know. I do not know. Sam seemed pretty good at\nfiguring it out last time. Okay  we are back at\nthe train station. And this is definitely\nthe tallest thing. We have to send\nthe tallest building ...that is not the train station. So I believe... it is that thing up there.\nLet us take a picture of this. It's pretty distinctive. I hope that that does not give\naway too much information  but  we'll see. Let me put you down\nfor a second. Five minute bonus.\nWhatev-ah. Whatev-ah. Five minutes is five minutes.\nI'll take it. What is that?\nOh  that's unique. That  I mean  we could\nfind that building if we found the town. And very modern  very fancy.\nVery modern. That's gotta be\nsomewhere touristy. It's got that fancy of a building. Here  hold this for a second. Let me just look up...\nWhat prefecture are we in? Could we ask about\nprefecture actually? Do you want to just\ndo the Radar first? I like a Radar just to be like  are we even in the right\nballpark at this point? Yeah. So far we have no\nconfirmation that we are. I guess let's wait a minute\nand see if we can match the photo. It looks like a rest—\nI mean a restaurant. I mean my only other\nthought would be... a university style thing \nbut I think restaurant. I'm thinking small and touristy. I kinda feel like another photo. This photo is so distinctive. Yeah  I want to drop\na 25 mile Radar just to make sure we're not way off.\nSure  yeah. No  it's worth it because\nI think they're  it's plenty. Does that definitely encompass\neverything that we want? Okay  cool  send it. (clears throat) Sorry  I was just sitting here trying to reorganize my cables\nbefore I went back out to go find a hiding place\nagain  but... Sam and Adam have just... have gone to Mishima and asked for a 25 mile Radar. It is a hit.\nI'm within 25 miles of Mishima. But that is not the right way. They were— They coulda\ncome straight down here. So I think that they must\nbe missing something. I'm just not sure\nwhat that thing is. They're gonna have to\nuntangle this mystery pretty soon  or... or this is going to\nbecome the winning run. Clock is ticking  boys.\nClock is ticking. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus (sighs) This is not\ngoing well for us  Sam. Adam  I'm really scared. We never get to the ad read\nwhen we're this far away. I know. We need to find Ben. If you guys want to see\nAdam and Sam continue to suffer  you can watch the next episode\nright now by heading on over to our streaming service  Nebula. You hear that?\nI feel like I heard something. It sounded like somebody\nwas making the pitch for an incredible streaming\nservice called Nebula where you could see\nthe next episode right now because we put up\nevery episode early. Why would\nsomeone be doing that? I don't know.\nI mean  Nebula sounds pretty neat. But I sure wish that\nit had an aftershow where you could hear us\ndiscussing what happened in the latest episode of Jet Lag. I love listening to us yap.\nYeah. Well  actually  if you\nwatch Jet Lag on Nebula  you can listen to our\naftershow podcast  The Layover  where we get into the nitty-gritty\nand behind-the-scenes and all that good stuff. And it's the definitive way\nof watching Jet Lag: The Game. Do you not think\nthese vague sounds of promoing a niche streaming site\nfull of original content... Doesn't that kind of\nseem like a sign that ...Ben could be close? I don't know.\nWe could pop down a Radar. All this talk about\nthis streaming service is making me wonder. Does it have other things on it\nthat you could watch? Not just our show and podcast? Can you—\nWhy are you talking— We need to focus. Well  actually  we have a bunch of other\nawesome stuff on Nebula  like The Getaway \nwhich was a competitive reality travel show\nthat we made  it was really fun. We also made a bunch\nof documentaries. And also  all of your other\nfavorite creators are on there making content that is ad-free \noften early  often extended  and some of it is\ncompletely original  like great shows from\nRealLifeLore  Real Engineering \nand so many others. Should we do a... We could do a Radar. We could do a Thermometer.\nSee if we can find him. But while we sort of\nmake our call on that  I do wonder how you would sign up\nfor this streaming service. Why do you keep\nbringing this up? So basically  if you go ahead and you go to\nnebula.tv/jetlag  you can sign up\nand get 40% off. It's the best way to get\na great deal on Nebula and also to support us \nbecause when you use our code  then we get some extra money\nto keep making the show. So we would really appreciate if you used our code\nwhen you signed up. (smooches) Maybe we missed a train line? Yeah  we should\nprobably look into it."

        "transcript": "Hello  and\nwelcome to episode five of our six-day game of\nhide-and-seek across Japan. Right now  we're about seven hours\ninto Ben's second run  and things aren't looking great. If Ben lasts another three hours \nthis will become the longest run and start extending his lead. If it lasts until\nthe end of the day  then things get even worse. We'll have less than\ntwo days remaining  meaning that after we catch him  I likely wouldn't even get\na second run at all. Fortunately  the remaining map\nis quite small. We have him narrowed down to this area around\nthe Izu Peninsula  but we haven't quite found a spot\nthat makes a ton of sense. We're pretty sure that\nhe wouldn't have had time to make it down here  and this part of the map\ndoesn't seem to have the mountains that he\nsent us a photo of. So right now we're heading\nup to this area here to check out the Gotemba Line. We just deployed a 25 mile Radar\non our way to be absolutely sure that we're in the right region. The good news is that\nthe Radar is going to be a hit. We're not too far off. The bad news is... well  I'll just let Ben explain. Sam and Adam... have just... have gone to Mishima and asked for a 25 mile Radar. It is a hit.\nI'm within 25 miles of Mishima. But that is not the right way. They were— They coulda\ncome straight down here. So I think that they must\nbe missing something. I'm just not sure\nwhat that thing is. They're gonna have to\nuntangle this mystery pretty soon  or... or this is going to\nbecome the winning run. Clock is ticking  boys.\nClock is ticking. Okay  it's a hit  so... We know we're not going insane. Yeah.\nWhich is good. We haven't massively blown it. He's not up there. He's gotta be on the\nfreaking Gotemba Line  man. Which one is that? Honestly  we should\njust get on the Gotemba Line and ask if he's on the same line. I agree  but if he is  we should be able to\nfind that building. I know. Passengers transferring\nto the Gotemba Line Okay  wait. Yeah  we need to get off here. ...may exchange trains here. Yeah. Okay  ready? It's supposed to\nleave in one second. Well  you know \nthese rural lines are here now. Yeah  okay.\nOkay... Go  go  go. Platform five  you said?\nYep. Is it gone? Yeah. Well  now that\nthey've got their answer  which I guess should be\nsomewhat of relief  I do get to look at\nthe next two cards and draw one  so... Let's look. It's a five minute bonus. And it's a five minute bonus. Which five minute bonus\ndo I want more? I want this one. Boy  yeah  I don't really know what's going on with them. I think that they think\nthey've crossed out my zone. And I think that they're wrong. I think that they've made\na mistake somewhere. And I think that until\nthey can figure out what mistake they made... they're not gonna find me. He has to be\non the Gotemba Line. I think so. It seems impossible\nthat he could not be. We have an hour and\nsix minutes left of our Curse. It's probably frustrating\nbecause I think that hits the next two\ndepartures from here. Okay. This is the next train. Are you rolling it? You roll. Okay.\nI'm not good at it. Alright.\nI believe in you  Sam. Come on  come on. Hopefully this'll get\nus out of the heat. I believe in you. You can do this. Nice. Okay. Let's get on the train. Alright  we're moving. Do you want to ask him\nif he's on the same line? (sighs) Might as well. Okay  look.\nIf the answer to this is no  then I'm... totally baffled. Okay  well  because Adam and\nSam are going the wrong way... we get to eat food. Which is pretty exciting. I just went to this cafe\nand pointed at stuff on the menu that I kind of recognized. And it's great. Oh man  okay. They're asking if I'm on\nthe same line as them. They're asking it\nfor double because... they technically already asked that.\nThey didn't want to. It was when I hit them\nwith the randomize  if you remember. But I think they need to know\nif I'm on this line or not. So I get to get the reward twice. And they're not\ngonna like to hear... that I am not on this line. Got an answer. He's not on the same line. I don't... (exhales) We must be missing something. We simply must be. How is that possible? So that means I get\nto look at the top three. And draw one. Twice. Discard two  draw three.\nCurse of the Zoologist. Curse of the Zoologist. Take a photo of a wild fish  bird \nmammal  reptile  amphibian  or bug. The Seekers must take a picture of a wild animal in\nthe same category before asking another question. Oh  god. That could be brutal. And draw one  expand\nmaximum hand size by one. I'm taking Curse of the Zoologist.\nSo if I can find... a frog  or a snake \nor a lizard  or something. That could make it quite\ndifficult for them to clear this. And then I get to do it again. Curse of the Black Hole. Curse of the Black Hole. Draw a 75 mile radius\naround the Seekers. They cannot ask any questions\nwhile in that zone for the rest of the round. Casting cost: Seekers cannot be within 100 miles of\nyour hiding zone. Five minute bonus... and discard one  draw two. Eeeh. So  Curse of the Black Hole\nis not going to work. I guess the question is just \ndo I want to get rid of my five minute bonus for... a discard one  draw two? And I actually think I don't. Because  at that point \nthere would be nothing else that I would want to discard.\nSo I'm just not taking any of this. He has to be on\nthe other line  then. Which other line?\nThe one that goes west. The one that you think\ndoesn't have enough mountains. It's surrounded by rice fields. Alright  well  let's get off\nthis stupid train. Oh  my god. I don't... Well... Things are going bad. So now that we have the\nCurse of the Zoologist... which I think is a very good Curse \none of the best... especially if you've got time  and I think that I might have\na little bit of time while they try and\nfigure out... their mistake... I'm gonna go tromp\nback into the woods and try and find a snake. In a safe way.\nNot a dangerous way. And it will hopefully make... Sam and Adam's head explode. Okay. What are we missing? So  here's the state of the map. With the Gotemba Line excluded  there are only a handful\nof stations left in play. There are a few down here  but we don't believe he\ncould've gotten there in time. There are some along the coast here  but the geography\njust doesn't match up. He shouldn't have been able to\nsee the mountains down here. Then there are a few stray stations\nover here and over here  but we've been\nchecking their streets against the Strava map \nand none of them seem to line up. So basically  we must be\ngetting something wrong. And the longer it takes us\nto figure out where we messed up  the more likely it is\nthat he'll make it all the way to the end of the day and put me out of\nthe running for good. It feels like we know\nall of our options. And  I feel like the\nmost plausible thing at this point is a mistake. I mean  honestly  maybe we should\nthrow down Tentacles. At this point. I mean  at this point \nwe are in trouble  time wise. ♪ Back into the woods\nto find a snake ♪ ♪ It's time to find\na snake today ♪ ♪ And we're gonna take\na picture of the snake ♪ ♪ or a frog or a fish ♪ ♪ or something that will make ♪ ♪ Adam go postal\nand kill everybody ♪ ♪ in Japan ♪ We at least believe... that he could not have\nmade it south of Itō based on the schedules\nthat we are aware of. But I would say that\nI'm not 100— That's not something I feel like \nyou know  that's not proof positive. As far as I can tell... he has to be on this line... maybe this line... or somewhere in here. Those are the only lines\nI can identify that are possible. Yeah.\nUnless he made it down here... because we are wrong\nabout the schedules. I even scoured that line.\nIt didn't seem a great fit. I mean  I didn't\nspend that much time. So  I don't know. I know that the vibes\ndon't seem right on the western line. But at this point... I think that we might have\nto check or something. You know what I mean?\nMhm. I mean  what\ndo you think  with? I mean  I would maybe\nthrow down a Tentacles. We're so lost that I'm not barely\neven worried about Curses anymore. I at least need to\nfigure out what's good. Yeah  I'm not against\nTentacles at this point. Because also  if it's a miss  then we know he's\nnot anywhere on here. Yeah. Let's Tentacle. Let's do aquarium  shall we? Sure. I'm just like \nat this point man  Yeah.\nI'll do anything. Yup. I don't... I don't see any snakes. I don't know how\nnature documentarians do it. I'm not sure what\nyou're supposed to say when you're just like  \"I don't know.\nI don't see anything yet.\" Okay  well they've\njust done a Tentacles. They've done an aquarium Tentacles. They've done an aquarium Tentacles\nfrom Shimo-Togari. I am... not within 15 miles of there. But... I will happily take\na look at four cards and take two. Or maybe not even up to two.\nSo my hand's looking pretty good. I honestly think that the hand\nis getting close to optimized. Okay  Curse of the Census Taker. Curse of the Census Taker. The Seekers must immediately\nvisit a town or city hall within a mile of\ntheir current location. When there  they must\nestimate the population under that town hall's jurisdiction and get the answer\ncorrect within 25%. Otherwise  you are awarded\nan extra 30 minutes. Casting cost: The Seekers'\nnext question is free. 15 minute bonus \n5 minute bonus  15 minute bonus. Them 15 minute bonuses\nare pretty schweet. So I'm just gonna replace\nmy five minute bonus with a 15 minute bonus. And  you know \nit's not that exciting  but honestly  my hand is\npretty freaking optimized right now. I've got an hour 35\nof time bonuses and a really good Curse.\nSo I  you know  I'm not sweating it. (wind rustling)\nYeah. You know? He is not within 15 miles of us. What the (bleep)\nOkay. So that has to mean\nhe's on the little line  right? Train's coming pretty soon. So theoretically  that's not\nsupposed to leave for three minutes. And we're done in 90 seconds. Okay. Well  we could roll for it anyway \njust see if we can get on it now. Might as well \nyeah  just in case. Okay.\nGreat. Actually  let me\njust pull something up. Okay.\nHold on a second. Here's the thing. I think that we need to\ndouble check south of Itō. Just wait a second.\nOkay. Yeah  Google was wrong. Awesome. So he's probably south of Itō? According to Apple Maps \nhe could have gotten there... Yeah  of course he could.\n5:55. Yeah  of course he could. 'Cause seemingly\nGoogle will not route you on the Shinkansen there\nfor some reason. Yeah  okay.\nSo... So that's almost\ncertainly where he is. Well  let's look into it. Do you want to look\nat Strava shapes  and I'll look at...\nI'll try to find that building? Yeah. This sucks. I feel like it's so easy\nto find a snake when you're not looking\nfor a snake. But all of a sudden  when you're trying to go\nand rassle up a snake... to have for Jet Lag: The Game... you can't find a snake. No snakes. But check this out. That's pretty cool. Maybe I should hide in there. In that... cave. It's getting rainy.\nAt least Ben might get rained on. I'm noticing that  yeah.\nThat'd be nice  right? If that ends— Oh boy.\nAt least... Do we win if Ben... Gets struck by lightning? Gets struck by lightning\nand loses a pulse? No  I think that his time...\nI think we still have to find him. Even if he's dead.\nBut if him is gone... I guess if he can't\nanswer questions... Well  yeah.\nThat would disqualify him. And I guess\nit's a question of... is it more about his soul? Or his mortal form?\nYeah. What is the him\nwe're trying to find? I have been\ngoing into the woods and shouting snake. And no snakes have appeared. Isn't there a frog?\nA cute little frog over here? Is there a cute little frog... here? Is there a cute little fr— No? Mother-(bleep)-er. This sucks. (chuckles) Okay. So... We should be able to\nnarrow it down decently. Because even with\nApple Maps' definition  it would have gotten there\nat 5:55. So he would've had\njust over 30 minutes. Okay. We were about to head down there\nthree hours ago. If this ends up being the thing  it'll be the greatest\nApple Maps advertisement. Well  yeah  it'll also be\na great endorsement of vetoes. Because he vetoed\nthe biggest body of water. Yeah. And if we had seen that \nthat would have told us quite a lot. Yeah. (storm winds whipping) Alright.\nIt's getting rather stormy. So there are\nonly a few stations that are far enough south  that are more than\n15 miles south of Atami. So we should only look at those. (wind surging) Whoa-ho-ho! Okay  so—\nIzu-Kōgen is the first one. According to this \nIzu-Kōgen is the furthest one he could have gotten to. Well... Let's take a look. We're on the move again. Looks like they went to Numazu. Numazu Station. I'm not there  so... Keep looking  I guess. So you're looking\nat street shapes  right? Oh  I'm looking at pictures. Oh  I was looking at pictures. I've got it. You got it?\nI've got it. That's it. Look at that. Look at that roof. That's it. (wheezes) Where is it? Where is it? It's Izu-Kōgen. It's also the furthest one\nhe could have gotten to. Well  at least we got it. Never trusting\nGoogle Maps again! Anyway  Google's\nour employer  technically. Or not technically.\nI'm... Google pays us our money. I was a Google Maps\nloyalist for so long. No  something flipped.\nAnd now... Apple Maps got better. Okay  so just to be clear \nwhat happened was: Ben is at a station\nthat Google Maps told us that he couldn't have gone to. Well... we'll get there in\nan hour and a half. Awesome. We only have a... a three minute connection. Eugh! I hope this rain\ndoesn't affect that. Oh my god. (wind gusting) I think God is\nintervening in this game. (thunder rolling) (thunder rolling) Sam  it's time\nfor our train to leave. Whee! The train is leaving—\nWait  we're not on a train at all. I think we might miss\nour three minute connection. Yeah. You know what this means  Adam?\nWhat's that? You know what this means?\nWhat does it mean? We missed the connection. By the time that we get there  we're going to be\nsearching in the dark. Awesome. Holy moly. (thunder rolling)\n(snickers) They're never going\nto find me in this. So will it be dark\nalready when we get there? It'll be just getting dark  because I think\nwe'll get there at six. Perfect. Well  at least it's\na really big place that'll have so much\nartificial light. Yeah! Ooh  ooh. Sam  I think there might be\na lot of museums there. Yeah? So we could use the\nmuseum one mile Tentacles. Oh  that could be big. But I'm saying  in terms\nof searching in the dark... Yeah. This way they\nwould give us  you know. Yeah. Because the real thing is  we have to find him\nbefore the day ends  so that we both can\nhave time for runs. Yeah. (wheezes) Okay  look  we're moving.\nWe're gonna get there. Ultimately  it's going to be fine. Yeah. Probably. Eventually  it'll be fine. Alright  well... It's looking like the storm\nis just about passed  but... Adam and Sam are now seemingly\nheading the right way. So... I think it's time for us\nto get back out there. And get in position. And that they have not\nhad a fun run thus far. But I am not... going to make the endgame\nany easier than I have to. Our train has\nmoved quite quickly. And I think we actually\nmight make our connection. Yeah  we'll be tight \nbut we've got a shot. Alright  let's punch it. (hums softly) Nice. Wow  what an adorable train. We never get to sit this way.\nOh  this is very cute. I wonder if this is\nwhy Ben took this train. Yeah?\n'Cause it's so adorable. Sam and Adam seem to be\nmaking a beeline for me. So  I don't know if I explained\nmy hiding strategy. I don't know how we're\nediting this  but... So far  the endgames have all\nbeen dictated by photos  right? We've all been able\nto find all of us with just a photo.\nSo  I'm thinking that... Adam and Sam are going\nto try and find me with just a Photo  probably.\nAnd I think... that I can use that\nto misdirect them. I think what I need to do... is I need to go hide somewhere in the middle of town. Just a random street. But then I put on\nmy ghillie suit and I sort of sit\nin front of some trees or some shrubbery. And if they ask for\na photo of me  then... it might look like\nI'm in the woods  and they might go\nexplore the woods first. And then  once they realize\nthat I'm not in the woods... in order to find me\non some random street  they're gonna have to be\nreally systematic about it  and they're gonna have to\nask a bunch more questions in order to narrow the area down. And when that happens \nI might get... some better time bonuses or... maybe even some Curses\nI can use in the endgame. Who knows?\nSo we're gonna keep wandering and hopefully we can find\nsomething that looks like that. Oh  look at that. It's the ocean! Which way do we go? Let's go this way. Let's go this way. Which way now? Let's go this way. I'm just fully getting\nmyself lost up here. I mean  I don't even know\nwhere I'm going. And my signature strategy... is that if I don't know\nwhere I'm going  they don't know where I'm going. And boy... I really do not know\nwhere I'm going. It's getting dark. Alright Sam  well there is\nstill a little bit of light out. I think it'll\nprobably be gone soon. Yeah  so we should\nreally try to find him quickly. Yeah.\nThe game day ends at 7:30. So it goes into the dark.\nYes. The sun is starting to set  and I have just\nsort of been wandering and wandering and\nwandering about my zone. And now I'm completely lost. But that is what I wanted. Because I don't want there to be any logic as to where I am.\nAnd... I think this street\ncould be kind of perfect. Because if I perch\nmyself up there... just on top of this rock... in front of this shrub... then  it might kinda look\nlike I'm in the woods. 'Cause you mostly just see trees. And on this side \nyou mostly just see trees. So... I think let's go perch up here. Eh-beh-beh-beh-beh. Eh-beh-beh-beh-beh. It is looking like their train\nis gonna be here soon  but... they're gonna have to\nmove quickly  because... the sun is about to set. And honestly \nonce the sun is fully down  I think it's gonna become\nnigh impossible to find me. All that is to say \ntime is of the essence. At least for them.\nI got all the time in the world. Alright  I think... Yeah  I agree. So I think— Hit him with it now  yeah. Got an awfully\ncomplicated set up now. Hello. So it looks like they're here. And they're starting off bold. They're starting off bold\nwith a Tentacles. Should certainly\nnarrow the area down  and it's smart of them\nto be going so systematically. But  Tentacles is still Tentacles. And that means that I still\nget to look at the top four and draw two. The four I got are a five minute bonus \nCurse of the U-Turn. This basically lets me\nforce them off their train if they're going\nthe wrong direction. Not useful now. Another five minute bonus \nor a randomize question. I mean  randomize question is gonna be better\nthan that damn Curse that I'm never gonna be able to use because I can't seem\nto find a snake. Perfect. That one? Kitagawa? Yeah. Yeah  okay. Photo of the tallest\nthing he can see  or photo of him? Tallest thing he'd be able to see.\nTallest thing he could  yeah. Oh  but photo straight up\nis probably gonna be just the woods  isn't it?\nYeah. I think tallest thing. 'Cause that'll tell us\nwoods regardless. If it's the woods  it's the woods.\nYou know what I mean? If it's tallest thing  at least\nwe can look for something. Okay  do that?\nYeah. Okay! Let's hurry. These are cute.\nIt's little teddy bear guys. Tallest thing I can see. A photo of the tallest\nthing that I can see. What can I see? I suppose it's probably that light pole over there  right? Okay. I'll go take a picture of that\nand send it over. I don't think it's going\nto be very clear  but... Maybe I'll be able to\nmake something of it. Oh my god. Curse of the Gambler's Feet. For the next hour \nSeekers must roll a die before they take any steps\nin any direction. Casting cost: Roll a die. If it's an even number \nthis Curse has no effect. Oh my god. Let's think. Hopefully there's— There's the (bleep)-ing... Yeah  there's the thing. All the lights are on now. Alright  we got our photo.\nHe's clearly kind of... in bushes or something.\nNext to... I guess a light pole. So we know he's near a street.\nPerfect. Can you take this\nwhile I navigate? Yep. So the tallest thing\nhe can see is a light post. Yeah.\nSo that's great. We just need to ask him more stuff\nbefore we get Cursed. We could do a\nquarter mile Radar. You know what we should do?\nSend the nearest street photo. Oh yeah  the outline?\nYeah. Yeah  let's do that. Because we can\nmatch that to a street. That's probably\nthe best way to find him. Well the other thing is  where are there dense\nenough woods that... he would only be able\nto see a light post? You know what I mean? Okay  I'm rolling this die and everything I'm doing\nhere is really janky. But I just have to\nroll an odd number to get the Gambler's Feet\nCurse to work. Here we go. Oh. What is it? That's a three. Yeah  that's a three. Okay. Sorry  sorry  Sam and Adam. Wow  we've been\nhit with Gambler's Feet. Curse of the Gambler's Feet. For the next hour \nSeekers must roll a die before they take any steps\nin any direction. Yeah  well \nkinda saw that coming. At least we got in\na lot of useful questions. I don't know why\nhe didn't Curse— We have enough questions that I honestly think that we\ncould find him with just this. Alright. Six! Okay. They've asked for another question. They've asked for me to\ntrace the nearest street. That could be quite useful \nbut there's a lot of streets. Top one  what is it? Oh my (bleep)-ing god. It's a 30 minute bonus  right?\nI can't quite see. Yeah  that's a 30 minute bonus. I think I'm up to\ntwo hours of bonuses now. That's crazy! Three. Yeah. The street lights are\non the right side. One. We should take a minute \nby the way  to set the stakes. If we don't find him by 7:30  then his hide will go\ninto the next game day. And Sam  it will be impossible—\nYeah. You won't get another run.\nYeah  that is true. Oh  we have an answer.\nOkay. This should do it. Is it this? Maybe?\nWhich one  which one? This one. Oh? I think I got it. It's this. Is that what you were seeing? Well  it's one of these  I think. It's gotta be this.\nThat one seems most likely. Doop-doop. Shoop-shoop. Right?\nYeah. Bahp-bohp.\nSure seems right. Not too far away from it.\nNo  it's five minutes... Five minutes walking normally.\nNo  we gotta go this way. Five  One  two. Alright  hello. They are getting closer. So I'm gonna turn off\nthis light  and hopefully... (chuckles) Hopefully they just\nwon't see me out here. Okay  we're going dark. Wait  I wanted that to be cooler. Okay  we're going dark. Wait  no. Okay  we're going dark. (bleep)-ing turn off! No! Why did my remote turn on? I really— I thought\nthis was gonna be so cool. I thought it was gonna be so cool\nwhen I say \"we're going dark.\" Alright  we're going dark. I got it to work. Aah. I can't believe the\ngame designers made it so that this game could\ngo into the night. It's a little bit OP\nfor hide-and-seek. Well  you know \nyou kinda have to earn it though. Yeah. Alright  I think this is our right. This is our right  okay.\nYep. Is that the light pole? Six. No  we're not close enough.\nOkay. This up here is\nthe start of our street? The right?\nNo  straight. It looks like he\nshould be on the left. And the light poles actually\nwill give us a shortcut. One  two. 'Cause he's gotta be\nnear a light pole. Five. Well  here's\nthe first light pole  so we should— Okay  is that\nthe same light pole? Can we check that?\nWait a minute. I see a faint green light. Okay  wait  five.\nOne  two. Our microphones\nmake faint green lights. Oh  there he is!\nFive  hey buddy! It's the DJI that gave it away. It's the little\nDJI microphone! Hi. Are you wearing a ghillie suit?\nI am. That's fun. That was a pretty annoying day\nwe ended up having. Yeah. And now in first\nand second place. Yeah  well I also have\nover two hours of time bonuses. What the (bleep)?\nYeah. So it's gonna be a\ntough one for you guys. Well  Adam  you better get going. Okay  bye!\nBye. Bye  Adam. Oh  he's running. Oh  he stopped running. Alright  Sam  let's go\nfind a place to go to sleep. Yeah. Alright! We're back and better than ever! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Hello and welcome\nto this episode of the Jet Lag: The Game\nad read. I'm your host  Sam  and joining us today\nis Mr. Adam Chase. Hello  good to be here. And Mr. Den— Ben Doyle. I am happy to be\non the podcast. Let's talk about chemtrails. No  today we are talking about why they should\nsign up and listen to our podcast  The Layover. And the bit is that we're doing it\nin the style of a podcast. (laughs exaggeratedly) It's a funny bit.\nYeah. So Ben  tell us\nabout your experience being on the Layover podcast. Well  on the Layover podcast  you know  it's fun\nbecause we get into all the behind-the-scenes  the stuff you might'a not\nseen on the show. And we talk about our strategies. We talk about some sort of crazy ideas we have\nthat you might not hear about. Like  who really caused\nthe COVID-19 pandemic? That isn't something we\ntalk about on there at all. But I will say that\nthe whole show is supported by the Nebula subscribers. And so we kind of figured  why not do something\nspecial for them to thank them for being subscribers. And that's sort of in some ways why this aftershow is\nexclusive to Nebula. That's kind of the idea there.\nSo anyway  you know... Let's stop the podcast though\nfor a quick word from our sponsor... signing up for Nebula \nwhich you can do for 40% off when you use the code\nnebula.tv/jetlag. And sort of something—\nI've mentioned this before and do want to just\nemphasize it again. It'd be really great\nif you use that code if you sign up for Nebula \nbecause sort of the financial model just to sort of  you know \nlet them in on this. We only get our money  honey \nif you use our code. If you just go and sign up\nfor Nebula just regularly  they don't know we sent you  and so we don't get directly \nyou know what I'm saying? I am the world's\nforemost expert on finance. Yeah.\nAnd... My advice\nthat you should follow is that this is a very good deal.\nMhm. And...\nYeah. Because at 40% off  that's... You're only paying 60%.\nYes  exactly  yeah. And that is a very... That is a sizable \nthat is a big discount. It's a big discount.\nYeah. And I finance. You finance.\nYeah  that's true. That's true. Well  in a sense  they finance because the Nebula supporters\nare the ones who fund the show. Mhm. No  but I know finance. Of course  yeah.\nI'm really good at finance. Ben  take us out.\nBring us out of here. (cracks up) Thank you?\nThank you."

        "transcript": "(water surging) Hello! Welcome to my new hiding zone! Things are going to\nbe better this time. Maybe. Welcome to episode 6 of our six-day game of\nhide-and-seek across Japan. As a reminder  in this game  the Seekers will attempt\nto find the Hider as quickly as possible by asking questions from\nour giant question menu. The Hider must answer\nthese questions truthfully  but in exchange  they'll get to\ndraw cards from the Hider deck  which give them\nadvantages in the game. Last episode  after quite\na lot of difficulty  Adam and I found Ben hiding\nat Izu-Kōgen Station. Our long search  plus Ben's\nimpressive hand of time bonuses  put him in a commanding first place with a time of\n13 hours and 9 minutes. Last night  Adam had\nthree and a half hours to get from Ben's final location\nto a hiding place. Given that it's day five out of six  this will be Adam's\nlast chance at hiding. So he'll have to hope he's\nchosen a spot tricky enough to throw Ben and me\nway off his trail. Alright  Ben.\n7:30. We're back.\nOkay  let's go get Adam. It's 7:30. There's a train that's\nleaving the station really soon  so we gotta boogie. Yeah  I mean \nthat would operate under the assumption\nthat we want to go north  but it would be a wild call for him to go south.\nLook  it would be a big brain move for him\nto have gone south. But I honestly think that \nif he did that  we're fine. Here's one thing I'll say  Sam. I think we're playing\non ultra hard mode. Adam wants this win bad \nand this is his last chance. Yeah  he's gonna go to\nthe most annoying location  most difficult location. Oh  Jesus. (water rushing) Alright  so here's the deal. I was planning on hiding somewhere in the greater\nmetro area of a city. Probably Nagoya. But the more I thought about it  the more I just kept feeling like it was gonna be a huge mistake. Because cities are hubs. Cities are the place that you go\nwhen you just need to move somewhere and then maybe you decide\nwhere to go next. So like if I had hid in Nagoya \nit would have been pretty easy to figure out I was\nin that direction. And then they probably\nwould've just headed basically to Nagoya\nto decide their next move  and then they would have\nrealized I was there. This is basically\nwhat happened to Sam in season 1 of hide-and-seek\nwhen he hid in Winterthur. We went there almost immediately. See  I figure at this point... I need them to really screw up\nin order for me to win  right? We screwed up bad against Ben. If I'm gonna have any shot \nI need to be in a place that has the potential\nto mess them up that bad. And that's why I chose here. Now look  there are certain\nquestions they could ask me that would put me in\nsome real trouble. But  with the right\nmix of questions  this is a place that I think\ncould really throw them off. Will it work? We will certainly find out. If we don't catch him\nby the end of today  if we don't catch him by 7:30...\nThat's that. I don't even have\na shot of a winning run. Yeah. Just based on\nour end time  so... Well  I'm also motivated\nto catch him today  because if we don't catch him today \nI think I'm toast  too. Yeah  I mean  basically \nwe're in the same boat. Alright  back at the station. What do you think\nthat little tower is for? I was wondering about that. I don't know  but I'm\nkind of wondering what this... decorative rock is about. Oh yeah  it seems to be\na thing that people pull. Oh  why? I don't know.\nOh. Alright.\nJust made it. So we should\ninvestigate questions. Actually  Ben  what could\nbe useful is maybe... nearest Shinkansen. I was looking at that. Asking if he's near\nthe Tōkaidō Shinkansen  it would pretty clearly\ngive us a direction  right? It would... I think if it was a hint \nit would imply going west. Theoretically  there's\na little bit more east  but I don't think that\nwould make much sense. Right. Yeah  I think that's not a bad one.\nYeah. I mean  won't 100%\ngive us direction. I mean  it could  but... I think that's\na good thing to know. Yeah  I know.\nIt'll exclude a lot of territory. We can ask that now.\nYeah. You wanna ask that now?\nI'd say hit it. Alright  real quick  before they ask me\nmy first question. I also want to show you\nthis bridge. There's this really\ncool bridge here. See? Cool bridge. Pretty cool bridge  huh? Pretty neat. Alright  first question. They have asked if\nmy nearest Shinkansen is the same as theirs. Okay  this is actually a question\nI was hoping that they would ask. This sort of maybe\nhelps play into my plan. Let's do our three cards. Five minute bonus. Ten minute bonus.\nFifteen minute bonus. Okay. I guess that's fine. I guess we'll take the 15. Alright. Let's move into town. Okay  his nearest\nShinkansen is the same. That's very useful. That narrows things down a lot.\nIt does. It means that we probably\nwant to go towards Nagoya. I think so. I mean  a big question\nis just going to be how far down that line\nwe want to travel. And so  a big Radar\ncould make sense soon? It could  yeah. I mean  is there any\nchance we want to... get a photo while we're waiting? I really feel like\nwe're underusing photos  because they're so cheap.\nYou love your photos. Well  yeah  but\nthey've been the thing that has confirmed—\nI know  I know  you're cracked. You're cracked with the photos.\nGeoGuessr pro  Sam. It's just like  there's\nso much potential spillover info. Here's what I'll say.\nIf we ask him for the picture of the tallest thing from\nthe train station  he's gonna get super exacerbated. No  exasperated. That's roughly right  I think. Because that's\nwhat got him last time. He might freak out.\nIt's true. I feel like psychological warfare\nis an important part of this game. I mean  it is easy\nto make Adam freak out  and that does throw\nhim off his game. I think that he might be like  \"Oh my god  they're\ngoing to figure me out.\" I think we're going to want\ntallest building at some point. I think it's\na good one to have. Why don't we just do it now?\nMaybe there's extra in the front. Let's get it. Okay  well... This is not... really what we hoped for. So this is a question I really\ndid not want to get asked. It's really lame that\nI got asked it so soon. We happen to be at\nthe train station right now. What is the tallest\nbuilding I can see? I think it's that. Let's try to get as close\nto that as possible... so that we can send a\npicture of it  without... showing that we're\nin the mountains. Ugh  I don't like how\ndistinctive that building is. I don't like that. I do not! Sam  Two-Minute Connection\nis my middle name. Because my parents thought\nthat would be cool. The police were called because they thought it was\nchild endangerment. Interesting  okay. Sam  I think\nwe're gonna make it. That's it. Sam  look at the beach. Should we steal Adam's line? What's Adam's line?\nLet's go to the beach  beach. Let's go get away. They... hey... He knows more of it than me. I think you did\npretty good  Sam. Thank you. Yeah  there it is. Okay. Oh yeah. Yeah  that's good. Real quick  let's draw our card. Awesome. Awesome  no  that's really good. No  that's actually great\nthat we got a five minute bonus. No  that's actually— that rules. Now let's see if\nwe can get breakfast without getting bothered again. Ah  man. So what I'm really happy with \nin terms of that photo  is that I don't think\nyou can tell at all that that's in the mountains  or that this place has\nareas that are really small. I think that reads as suburban  major city. So hopefully it's actually\nactively unhelpful for them. We've got mail.\nWe've got mail. Is it a picture?\nIs it a picture? It's a fairly generic...\nI mean  that implies to me like... It's got an antenna. Yeah  I mean that\nlooks like a lot of just... not like center of city \nbut kind of like... Basically I don't think\nhe's on city streets. And I also don't see any... Well  maybe it would\nbe hard to tell. I don't really see\nany mountains or anything. At least means he's not here. Makes me think that\nhe is at least decently far. But this sort of further\nencourages my theory that I think we should do\na 100 mile Radar. Because I think with\na 100 mile Radar  we'll be able to cut off\nbasically everything except for the stuff that\nhe could have gotten to by going to Nagoya or further. And so if it's a miss  then we would know to\ngo straight to Nagoya. Yeah. Send it? I think send it.\nLet's do it. Okay  they've requested\na 100 mile Radar. I actually don't even know... if I am or not. Oh  huh. I actually would argue\nthat's pretty bad news. I would actually argue\nthat is not so good. Uuugggh. Alright  Ben. We got an answer. What do you think it is?\nI think it's a miss. Well  it's a hit.\nOhhh. That is really interesting.\nOh  okay. It's very  very interesting. Okay  Mr. Adam Chase. I feel like it narrows\nthe map down a lot  but I am now... Yeah  I do not know what\nour next move is gonna be. Sorry  I know this is an\nintense gameplay moment  but I keep seeing\ncool stuff out the window. It's okay  we're getting both. Look at that.\nAnd then back to Sam. And then back to that.\nAnd back to Sam. Sam  what do we do?\nI can see the map. Let's draw our cards. One. Fifteen minute bonus \nnot terrible. Two. Five minute bonus \npretty bad. Oh wow  tough decision.\nOh man  which one do I go with? Alright  let's go find breakfast. Welcome to Atami. This right here?\nIt's a great dice throwing course. Oh  is that where you did it?\nThis thing  yeah. You gotta watch out for the cars.\nSure. They're trying to kill you.\nBut aside from that. So  one thing I'm keeping in mind is the Kawaguchiko area\nwould be a likely candidate. I mean  I'm almost tempted to ask for tallest mountain. Just to see if it's Mt. Fuji? Because there is a lot\nof zone around here where you would see Mt. Fuji. It's true.\nAnd it's cheap. And mountains\ntold us a lot yesterday. Yeah  tallest mountain \non the off chance that the tallest mountain\nhe can see is Mt. Fuji is kind of fun. Well look  those\ntake a little while. We still have to sort of figure out\nwhat our next main move is. So I think  let's ask for\nthe mountain photo for now. Even just for fun.\nYeah. Alright  let's do it.\nYeah  why not? Oh  come on. Not only is that one\nof the worst questions they could have asked me... I just want to eat my breakfast! (sighs) Okay. What do we reckon\nthe tallest mountain is? It's gotta be that one  right? Yeah  gotta be that one. Okay. I was kind of hoping that\nwe would be five or six hours in when they knew I was\nin the mountains. Not so much that we would be\nan hour and a half in. That was less what I was hoping \nto be honest with you  audience. (groans loudly) We took a risk with our hiding spot.\nWe knew it was a risk. We knew it was a risk.\nWe knew this. So far  the risk isn't paying off.\nBut here's the thing. I have a tendency  I know  to kind of vacillate between \"it's so over\" and\n\"we're so back.\" And right now  it kinda\nfeels like it's so over. Because they know\nI'm within 100 miles  they know that I'm closest\nto the Tōhoku Shinkansen. And they now know that\nI am in the mountains. But maybe soon\nwe'll be so back. The key at this point is we\nneed them to make a mistake. We need them to (bleep) up. It's pretty much the deal\nas far as I can tell. I am finally going\nto eat my noodles. Okay  now we need to discuss how to exclude Tokyo. Basically  the greater Tokyo area.\nRight. We are one stop away from\nthe next prefecture over. Well  yeah \nand so that prefecture is in the same region as Tokyo. So if we went to there \nwe could ask about region  and that would...\ncheck all of Tokyo. It's so definitive.\nIt's so definitive  and... We are in a unique situation where we are right\non the region border. Yeah. I think we should do that.\nYeah. Alright  let's go find\nthe train up to... Platform 5.\nUp to that region. Oh boy. Sam  we got our photo.\nOh. We got our mountain photo. That is tall. It is tall.\nIt is not Mt. Fuji. It's not Mt. Fuji \nbut I also would say that... Can you see mountains\nlike that from Tokyo? No.\nI don't think so. The fact that this is pointy. Yeah  that's like a\nmountain mountain. I do think that we still want to go and check and see if he's in the Kantō region.\nI agree. We just  we gotta\neliminate that possibility. It's worth it.\nBut then after that  I think we gotta start\nlooking towards the mountains. But that does make me think\nthat he's maybe gone up to Iida or Kōfu or somewhere\non one of those lines. This is our train.\nI mean... The line to  Kōfu  it fits a lot. Not only is it mountainous \nbut these mountains  look  they block your view\nto Mt. Fuji super well. So I think that that's\na pretty good theory. But  we're off to go\ncheck the Kantō region. Okay  real quick  we need to draw\nour card for our photo. Curse of the Hidden\nHangman  not bad. Curse of the Hidden Hangman. Before asking another question or boarding another\nform of transportation  Seekers must beat the\nhider in a game of hangman. Casting cost: Discard two cards. Okay. Come on. Go the wrong way.\nGo the wrong way. Go the wrong way. This chair leans back so far.\nI feel like I'm gonna fall asleep. (indistinct) (indistinct) Alright  well  welcome to... Where are we?\nWe're in the right region. We're in the Kantō region. Should we ask that question?\nYeah  let's hit it. Let's hit the question. Eugh  same region. Oh  that's not what you\nwere supposed to ask. Wait  wait  wait  wait.\nLet's check. Okay. This could be\nthat we're so back. This could be that we're so back.\nI would argue that this... has the potential to\nthrow them off a bit. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Not a match. Okay  so  he is\nnot in the Kantō region. Which is what we expected \nbut it's good. It's getting Tokyo out of your brain and\nall of those lines. Yeah. It's a relief. So now  we can focus up.\nHe's in the mountains. Alright  let's draw\nour cards real quick. Alright. One. Five minute bonus. Great. Two. F—Are you kidding me? If this is not a good card... You know what  it's fine! It's fine because\nCurse of the Hidden Hangman requires you to discard two. And now I have two useless cards\nthat I can discard with it. So it's actually fine. It's fine. I know I'm crazy... (cracks up) ...but Strava map? You think already?\nWe're gonna want it eventually. And honestly?\nMaybe the chances are not high. But  I think we have...\nfew enough candidates that there's a chance\nthat we just look at it and just get it. It's like... We're going to want it\neventually  right? Yeah. Here's what I'll say. I... I am in favor of asking\nfor the Strava map now purely from the perspective\nof psychological warfare. Well  here's another thing\nI'll say about Strava maps. What's uniquely useful when we know someone is\nin a mountainous town is normally the street orientation\nis going to tell you something. There are long streets that go\nparallel to the valley basically. Yeah  I'd say\nlet's ask for it now  and he's gonna start freaking out \nand that's gonna be really funny  and I want to see\nthat footage  so... Shall we? I think we shall. So I was just thinking \nwell  you know  at least... they've asked most of\nthe photo questions that would make me\nmove a lot. You know  there's not a lot left\nthat would make me move a lot. But no  of course... Alright  Atami. I never got to see Atami.\nIt's kinda cool. Sam  have you noticed\nthis awesome thing that they have foot baths\nat the train station? Oh  that's delightful.\nCan you imagine if... ...the MTA had this? I think they often do\nhave this sort of thing. It's just a lot less intentional.\nYeah. For me  methodology here... I think is... straight lines? I don't really know. I just kind of have\nthis feeling that... curvy lines are maybe\neasier to match. Whereas straight lines... you know  more generic. Okay  Strava map sent. Which means we draw\nanother card. I'm just gonna do it from here\nwhile I'm walking. Ten minute bonus.\nSure  why not? That's fine. That's fine. We got our photo. It's a shape.\nYeah  it's... The streets are straighter\nthan I would have thought. Because a lot of\nthose mountain towns  the streets are going\nto be kind of windy. (yawning) Yeah. These are like \npretty precisely... a grid? Certainly implies more to it. So I do think that that\nhelps exclude a lot. I mean  there's quite a few places that that simply\ncould not be  I think. But the shape is not one\nthat will be easy to confirm. I think that\nwe've got three lines that we think he might be on\nas our leading theories. So  I think a 50 mile Radar would sort of fully encompass\nthe nearest one. And also some of the\ncomplexity by the shore. So that seems like a good\nway of splitting the map. What do you think?\nOh yeah  let's hit it. Alright  let's hit it. Okay  a lot\nof things going on. They just got off\nthe train at Atami  so I think I'm gonna go ahead\nand use my Hangman Curse. It's kind of good to slow\npeople down whenever. And I might as well use it\nbecause the cost is discarding two  and I have two\nfive-minute bonuses that I'm very happy to get rid of. So I will be discarding these... and playing this. They've asked me\nfor a 50 mile Radar. I'm going to go ahead\nand answer that. It is a hit. I am going to draw two cards. Ooh  Gambler's Feet. Curse of the Gambler's Feet. For the next hour \nSeekers must roll a die before they take any\nsteps in any direction. Casting cost: Roll a die. If it's an even number \nthis Curse has no effect. Five minute bonus.\nWell  I know which one I'm taking. Okay  let's play hangman. Alright  report—\nWe're doing a report. Hello  from the Ben and Sam report.\nSam  what's going on? We've got a hit.\nOkay  we got a hit. That's good.\nI think so  yeah. They're gonna have\na much better map than we are right now \nbut mentally that means we have... a semi-circle? A pretty semi-ish circle. I would call it a semi-semi-circle.\nYeah. However  I believe we've\nalready gotten— Ugh. We're playing hangman again. Curse of the Hidden Hangman. Before asking another question or boarding another\nform of transportation  Seekers must beat the Hider\nin a game of hangman. To play  the Hider chooses\na five-letter word  and the game ends after\neither a correct word guess or seven wrong letter guesses. The Seekers cannot\nchallenge the Hider for ten minutes after a loss. After three losses \nthe Seekers are released. I don't like Hangman. Well  at least\nwe don't have to move. But I do feel like he's used\nmost of his good words. Now  I've thought of my word. And I'm going to try to use\ntheir strategy against them  which is  last time I did this  they went through\nall the vowels immediately. So I'm going to pick\na word that has one vowel  and it's going to be a weird one. Okay  let's play. E.\nNo. A?\nNo. I.\nNo. Adam  just do a normal word. Y.\nThat's kinda woke culture. Y  also no.\nThis is going well. There's only two vowels left. O  wrong one. What do you mean it's a no? Okay  try a U. Yes  there is a U. It only took you\nfive wrong guesses. I mean  do we just... We gotta just throw some\nconsonants out there  right? I like F. There is not an F. Try a T.\nT. Fellas  there is not a T. The word was crumb. Crumb  C-R-U-M-B. Gentlemen  I will see you again in ten minutes. Alright  let's find\na new spot to play. Well  that was\nnot our finest work. So  here's what I think. There is a train to Fuji \nleaving in 10–15 minutes. I think it would make sense\nto get onto it. I think that's\nnot a terrible idea. All signs point that way.\nOkay. Sam  do you want to put\nyour feet in the footbath? To be honest  no. But  I feel like it's\nprobably good content. Oh. Ohh  it's warm.\nOh. Oh my goodness.\nIt is quite nice. We should blur this\non YouTube and make it unblurred on Nebula.\nYeah  I'll do that. That would probably\npiss people off. I'll make that deal. This is rejuvenating me and making me more\npowerful than ever before. This baby is ready to\nget wild and loose. And so are we. Alright  let's play\nhangman again. I'm trying to use\na little bit of psychology. I think that they're going to think that I'm going to pick\nanother weird vowel. So they're going to start by\nguessing the weird vowels. But instead  I'm actually\njust going to pick a word that has a regular vowel in it. And hopefully it'll take\nthem a while to get to it. Alright  do you\nwant to start with one of those\n(bleep)-ed up ones like Y? Y. Okay  my theory seems good. Man. Let's just go and\n(bleep) up this order. Okay  so...\nI think U. U is a no. (bleep)  it's no. Maybe we should try an E. No. We need to clear this if we\nwant to get on the train to Fuji. A. Okay  they got A \nbut it took them a while. Okay  we got it.\nLet's try a C. C  no. Dammit  okay  do an S. No. It's so over. What about J? J's pretty (bleep)-ed up. Yeah  J is one of the most (bleep)-ed up letters\nthat there is. Okay  see again. Proof that they think\nI'm trying to be tricky. No. Do we— How many\nmore do we have? Uhh  one. I don't think we're\ngetting on this train. Uh  B. B  no! The word was graft \nlike a skin graft. Alright. What should\nwe do for the last one? Graft. Yeah  that's a messed up word. Alright  well  we can't get on\nthis train to Fuji  but that's okay. We're still gonna get\non a train to Fuji. Maybe.\nEventually. Interesting shots  interesting shots \ninteresting shots. Look  here on Jet Lag: The Game  we're trying to give you\nyour money's worth. Whoa! We're getting interesting shots. Interesting shots! Alright. Time for\nour third game of hangman. If we win this one \nthen we'll have wasted as much of their time\nas possible with this Curse. Here's another train to Fuji. Sam  we really gotta\nlock in this time. We gotta think of the best letters. I really like the letter C. I feel like the letter C...\nWanna start with C? It's just one of\nthose letters  man. Oh  shoot  there is a C. Oh  there is a C.\nWe got it. What could be after C? Could be H  could be T. I'd say  what's\na word that ends -CT? Well  like PACT  but... ...with five letters. SPECT. Try an H  I don't care. No  no H.\nI bet it's a T. T  no.\nWhat the hell? Look  let's come back\nto that part. A.\nNo. Okay  things are looking up. (deep gargly voice)\nDamn it! Aagh! We gotta go fast. U. No  no U.\nI. Shoot  yeah  there is an I.\nOkay  something -I-C. Oh  I guess it'd be a K. Yeah  okay  there is a K. Okay  it ends with -ICK.\nR would be a good guess. R  okay  good. Yeah  no R. You know  an L would\nbe a good guess  I think. Okay  yeah  there is an L. This is bad  'cause they have\ntwo more wrong guesses  and I think there's only\ntwo more possibilities. Alright  what do you think?\nFlick or Slick? I think Slick. S  no  it's not S.\nBut I think... Train's leaving soon \nI think let's try... F?\nLet's try Flick. Yeah  they got my ass. It was Flick. Alright  let's\nget on the train. Alright  off to Fuji. Curse cleared. Okay  well  you know what?\nWe won the first two. So that  I mean \nthat's a win  you know? I mean  that still wasted  what... almost 40 minutes?\nThat's pretty good. I am pretty worried about\ngetting back to shore. Off to Fuji. We'll figure out what we\nneed to do from there. Yeah  we got this. Whoo! Nice. Quick update from the river. They have gone the wrong way. So in terms of the\n\"it's so over\"/\"we're so back\" meter  it swung to us being so back. Currently  we're kind of so back. Which I'm loving being so back. I didn't like it\nwhen it was so over. Aw man  this dude is absolutely swangin' that thing. Oh  hell yeah  my guy! Absolutely! I found more data.\nOkay  tell me your data. Alright  it's good data. So  the line before... There's a very local line\nthat goes out of Fuji. Right.\nIt stops at these stops. There's a very local line that goes out of Kōfu\nand stops at these stops. And then there's\nthe long-distance service that goes nonstop. The thing is  stops served by\nthat long-distance service... He's not allowed to be there.\nThere a train gap more than an hour. He's not allowed to\nhide in locations with fewer than\none train an hour. So that means he's either\nnear the bottom or near the top. But the ones at the bottom... would in at the same prefecture.\nRight. So I think that\nif I got this right... That if we ask prefecture... We would narrow it\ndown just a few stations. And they're the stations\nthat I think he's in based on street shape and\nbased on train schedules. Do you wanna\nask prefecture now? Yes  might as well\nbefore we get Cursed. I think let's try it. Okay  so Adam's mic\ncut out for a second  but here he is\nanswering our question  then drawing his three cards. Personally  I think it's\neven better without sound. (no audible speech) We've got our answer.\nWhat's our answer? It's a no.\nIt's a no. I think that no\ngoes down to  just  it stops at Kōfu then. Yeah. We just gotta make sure... that he's— couldn't be\non any other ones. But  I just don't— Because the thing is \nif we have to go back... it'll take forever to get back. Yeah.\nSo... No  it's  that's so—\nIt's a one way train to Kōfu. It would be an\nirredeemable mistake if you had Kōfu and he wasn't there.\nYeah. He would likely win\noff of that mistake. Yeah  so we really gotta... Lock in. Make sure that there\naren't any other lines. Alright  the sun\nhas come out here  and it is getting a little hot. So I think we should... go find some shade. Some wonderful shade to sit in. My legs are barely\nholding it together. Okay  so I went ahead\nand reverse engineered... what information they have. And I actually think\nit's pretty bad for me. I'm pretty sure they\nknow I'm in here. Which worries me. We might need to start really\nthinking about our hiding spot. Really need to figure out a way to milk a few more\nhours out of them. There's Mt. Fuji  Sam.\nOh my god  it's really pointy. I was on top of that  six days ago. I can put a photo up. Okay.\nOf me on the top. Show a photo. I want to show a photo\nof something too. What do you want\nto show a photo of? I want to tell\nthe audience about how (bleep)-ed up\nmy foot is. Graphics team \npull up a photo of my toe. I don't think\nwe wanna show that. Graphics team  ignore Sam. We want retention. Welcome to Fuji.\nWe need that train. Okay  so again at this point... pretty sure we know\nwhat line he's on. But  the train does not leave\non that line for quite a while. It's time to do some research to make sure that we really\nknow what we're doing. We gotta lock in  Ben.\nIt's lock in time. You wanna get a snack\nbefore we lock in? Okay  it's snack time \nand then it's lock in time. Guess where we are? Back at 7-Eleven\nbecause it's lunch time. ♪ It's our lunch time ♪ What's our lunch gonna be? So many wonderful lunches. Hello  hello  report. We're just  we're doing\nmore research. We don't have a match yet. Yeah  and we haven't\nnarrowed down enough where... With a long  straight\nstreet like that... we know it's north-south. We should be able to\nmatch it on angle. I just don't see one on angle. Is there anything\non that line out of Kōfu? East of Kōfu?\nYeah. Well  he couldn't\nhave gotten there. I think he could\nhave gotten there. How?\nBy going through Tokyo. I think he might have\nbeen able to. I mean  you could—\nI'm not looking from yesterday. But you can get... all the way up to Otsuki... in less than three hours. So that's another line. Look  this is\nthe point in the game where I fear that you \nthe audience  might get bored. Because they are probably just sort of squinting\nat their phone screens  trying to match a Strava map. You know  you can't\nsee all the maps. So I feel like we\nneed to do something to keep your attention. So I'm gonna throw\nthis pen in the air and try to catch it\nbetween my teeth. Alright? And that's gonna be sort of\nan exciting diversion while you wait for them\nto figure out what to do. Nope  that was not gonna work. Okay. That is a bad idea. Okay  we're still\nresearching here  but we just don't\nquite yet have a match. I think we need to do something\nto verify that he's on this line. Because if he's not \nthen I don't know where he is. The question now is whether we get on\nthe limited express up to Kōfu  or the local. The local is slower... but it stops at all of the stations. And I'm advocating \nI think  for the local. Because if we get on the local \nwe can use the tool... to check and see if...\nYeah. I mean  I guess  theoretically \nif it's a miss  we just stay on  because we think he's\nin Otsuki or something. I mean  look  I don't like being on\nthe slower one either  but we just... I guess  yeah. We just don't know\nwhat stop he's on. It's gonna be\na long train ride. By the end of it... I'm hoping we know where he is. Okay  now that we are officially on the local line to Kōfu... we're gonna go ahead and ask if our train would\nstop at his station. Boy  if the answer is no... and we are stuck on\nthis local line for three hours \nit's gonna be bad. Hello. So as expected  they have headed up\non the Kōfu line. They've asked me if I am on\nthe same train line as them. I actually  you know  I don't know how they'll\nrespond to this answer. It's an interesting answer. And let's draw three more cards.\nAlright. One. Okay  Curse of the Bird Guide. Curse of the Bird Guide. You have one chance to film a bird for as long as possible \nup to 15 minutes straight. If  at any point \nthe bird leaves the frame  your timer is stopped. The Seekers must then film a bird for the same amount\nof time or longer before asking another question. Two. Curse of the Distant Cuisine. Curse of the Distant Cuisine. Find a restaurant within your zone that explicitly serves food\nfrom a specific foreign country. The seekers must visit a restaurant serving food from a country that\nis equal or greater distance away before asking another question. All Curses.\nCurse of the Frozen Dot. Curse of the Frozen Dot. Place a point on the\nmap at least 1 000 feet from where the Seekers\nare currently standing. If  in exactly 15 minutes  they are within 250\nfeet of that point  they are frozen in place\nfor the next 30 minutes. Let me check what\nrestaurants are around here. Yes  well  all the\nrestaurant types are in... Japanese  in fact  so... That's not gonna work. Frozen Dot  I don't like it. We're gonna do\nCurse of the Bird Guide. Look  there's a Ferris wheel\noff in the distance. That's cool. We should be getting this answer\nfrom Adam at any minute. Okay.\nOh  you're cooking? Adam's shape.\nYeah. Oh  he just texted us no.\nWith a kiss face. It was with a little kiss. Welp. (whispering) Now's not\nthe time for a little kiss. So  he's not on this line. Okay. We are now in train jail\nfor the next three hours. We are riding this train\nall the way up to Kōfu  and it is going to take a while. However  I believe by the\ntime we get to Kōfu  Sam... we can figure out where he is. Adam thinks he's got us \nbut we are in the cooking zone. This train is now\nin the cooking zone  and we are going to...\nWe're going to use... Just like a very slow boil. Alright  well actually  it looks like they're\nstaying on that train. So I think let's just\ngo ahead and find our bird. Actually  you know what  no.\nI think we should wait. If they're gonna ride\nthat line all the way up  then we should do this\nwhile they're about to transfer  like just before. Alright  I'm gonna level with you. It's very hot.\nIt's crazy how hot it is. As far as I can tell \nthere is no air conditioned area where I would be allowed\nto just sort of loiter. So never fear.\nI have developed a plan to cool off. Check with this. It's not... as close\nas I would like. And where is that  Uenohara? Yeah. I'm not sure that's it  Sam. Yeah  I mean  it's close. Oh  yeah. Oh  man. Oh  that feels so good! Oh! You know what? It's not a bad job\nat the end of the day. It's not a bad job\nat the end of the day. Whew. I mean  look  we can\nhang out here for a while. They're not even getting\nto Kōfu for two hours. So  basically\nwhat's going on is  we know that he's not on\nthis line that we're on  which is deeply  deeply painful.\nBut now we think that... he's kinda gotta be... at one of those stations\nthat's just east of Kōfu  in Uenohara or Otsuki. And then it's like  there is a line down from Otsuki towards Mt. Fuji \nbut we're pretty sure he could not have\nhad time to take it. But also  you can see\nMt. Fuji down there. Yeah. And so when we asked\nfor the tallest mountain  he would have showed us\nMt. Fuji. Okay. Back to research. I mean  the thing is  if we\ncan figure out where he is  and it is a place we can get to\nfrom Kōfu when we get there  I think we're still good. The problem is  if we get to Kōfu  and we still don't know\nwhere he is  who knows? Who knows how much longer\nthis is going to take? Okay  back to research.\nGood bye. If you're playing\non a really big area... sometimes there are\nparts of the game where you just get to relax. So if you're playing\nthe home game  and you're playing it\nin a really big area  you just have to take the time to see it as a little bit\nof me time. You know?\nA little bit of you time  I guess. I've been listening to... little Studio Ghibli scores\nand walking around. A wonderful dip in the river. It's not every day you're in a\nbeautiful Japanese mountain town. I mean  look at that! I mean  it is really incredible. Gosh. Pretty amazing. Look how big\nthat pipe is  Sam. Look at that big pipe. Okay. I'm in the kitchen. Cell phone service is slightly\npeaking this meal prep session. Alright  I think\nwe need to start scouting birdwatching locations. I thought this park\nwould have been good  but I can't actually see any birds. I can hear a few birds...\nbut I can't seem to find them. See  Ben would be better\nat this than I am. He's really good at noticing birds. Mmm... I don't know. I don't know. It's damn close  Ben. Let me see. Does that look familiar? Could be. It's close. Could be.\nIs that about 0.5 miles? No. It's just a guess. I gotta tell you  really\njust not finding a lot of birds. I can hear the birds. But I cannot find them. Little birdie statues do not count. I'm trying to draw a line. I'm cooking. I'm cooking.\nI'm cooking. I'm cooking. I'm cooking. Are you ready?\nYeah  I'm ready. Meal is served. Look  I have used math  science \nand all of the above to combine his overlay\nwith Google Maps. Whoa.\nThe proportions are perfect. Where the hell is that? That's Sogu—\nwhatever the (bleep). Saru— Saruhashi. The proportions are—\nThe proportions  the shape  and the orientation. Dead on. Okay  wait  wait  wait.\nI want credit. I was tracing the exact same thing. Yeah  but I've been\ntracing this for 30 minutes  and you didn't believe me. We were both cooking. How soon can we get there? Not soon. (laughs) Not that soon  Ben. I also don't know how he got there. I don't care\nabout that anymore. You agree  that's it  right? Yeah  I think\nthat this is a sort of \"ladies and gentlemen  we got him\"\nsort of situation. And not in the George Bush...\nNo  no  in the act  in the act. We do actually got him.\nOkay. They're finally\ngetting close to Kōfu. Which means we really do need\nto start finding some birds. I really have not had a lot of luck  but I'm wondering if\nmaybe there will be birds up in the bridge where it's shady. I can hear so many birds.\nI just can't see them. (bird cawing) Yeah  I hear you  man \nbut where are you? Alright  well  we've\nemerged on the other end of a very  very long local line. Yeah  I mean  it really\nis just an absolute crawl. Be a little tight. We'll have to be... We'll have to be good\non the short game. Yeah. Let's check the bridge. (bird cawing) Yeah  dude  I would love to chat. I hear you talking.\nI just need you to sort of come out. No birds up there. Maybe they don't\nlike the vibrations. Alright  they just pulled\nin to Kōfu Station. I need to start this soon \nbecause I want to start it such that I finish and cast it right around before\nthey're going to board. So the next bird I see  I think that's gonna\nhave to be the one. Alright  there's some birds.\nGo somewhere  yes! Yeah  sit up there. Yeah  dude. Freaking sit up there.\nThat's our bird. That's our bird. Right there. Just can't leave the frame. Oh  he's going somewhere. But not too far.\nDon't go too far. Don't go too far.\nI still gotcha. I still gotcha. I still gotcha. And he went behind the tree. 24 seconds. Awesome. Whew. It's toasty out. Welcome to Kōfu. One more train \nand then Adam is ours. Yeah. Oh  we're Cursed. Curse of the Bird Guide? Curse of the Bird Guide. The Seekers must film a bird\nfor the same amount of time or longer than the Hider did \nbefore asking another question. How long?\n24 seconds. (cackles) Oh  poor Adam. He didn't quite get that\nbird guide question to pop. I think it's\ngonna be better there  where there will be more\nopen areas and stuff. Yeah  I think that we'll be\nable to clear that no problem. I don't think he's gonna be\nhappy with that result at all. Okay. Now  we are officially\non the train to Adam. Adam Chase  you better\nget in your hiding spot. Chase. The Chase is over. He means that\nwe're gonna kill you. Okay. Let's go to our hiding spot. Okay  so this is one of\nthe two contenders for hiding spot. This is a really\nweird spot to get to. What I like about it\nis that the road shape seems like it better matches a different area\nthat's very annoying. So the hope would be\nthat they go a really annoying way\nto check that area  and then they have to\nbacktrack and come here. Okay. If this is my spot...\nthat's the tallest thing I can see. The trouble is... This  I fear  is a driveway. This  I fear... is kind of a driveway situation. Yeah  okay  I think\nthat's a driveway. Alright  plan B. Alright  well  seemingly\nthey are not worried about clearing my Curse. Which leads me to believe they probably matched\nthe Strava map  they know where I am. But we have a backup\nthat's pretty solid. So I think  we go there \nwe hope for the best. Sam  where do you\nthink he's going to hide? I want to mention for the edit  I want to edit my last statement\nto \"The Chase is up.\" No  it's too late. Because that\nmakes a lot more sense. No  it's too late. So here's the thing. There is this weird little community\nthat's right off of one street  and all of the roads are identical. So I could see it\nmaking a lot of sense for him to hide around there. 'Cause it would be really hard to get a clue as to\nwhere exactly he is. That seems like exactly the kinda\nbull-(bleep) that he would do. I don't see a gatehouse\nor anything  so... So you think it's fair game? Might just be  you know. Alright we have made it... to our general hiding area. Now we just have to pick a spot. All of the children are\ncoming home from school in this little suburb. And they are all really confused about why there's\nan American... vlogging. I think this is gonna be it. I think this is gonna go ahead... and be our spot. Alright. They're pulling into the station. You know  it'd be really cool if they just didn't\nget off the train. Just rolled right through.\nThat could be interesting. Alright  Adam.\nWe're coming for you. I think we're going this way. Yeah  they got off the train.\nOkay. (sighs) They still can't ask any questions. So I don't want to try\nGambler's Feet yet. I think let's wait till\nthey clear their Curse. And then we'll go for it. I really have\nnot seen any birds. This could be... a little tricky.\nYeah. I mean  look. We know that Adam was able\nto cast this Curse here by finding a bird. Yeah  so there\nmust be a bird at least. Sam  I still\ndon't see any birds. But there's trees and\na river over there. Yeah  let's go there. If I was a bird \nthat's where I'd go. I certainly hear birds. (bird tweeting) There!\nOh  bird called out to us. Do I have it? Yeah. Are you counting? Five  six  seven \neight  nine  ten... eleven  twelve \nthirteen  fourteen... Ugh  dammit. Alright  check the treetops. (whistling) Oh  you're making that sound. Come on. Come on. Still in frame?\nYeah  we're getting close. What was it  24?\n24. Come on. Oh yeah  it's circling. Come on. We got it  Ben. Alright.\nAlright  clear and hit. Clear and hit him. First clear \nif you asked him for a tracing of his\nnearest path or street. Hopefully that should be enough. Alright  and\nlet's draw a card. Would be awesome if it was good. A 30 minute time bonus\nwould be really sweet. Duplicate another card.\nThat's not awful. We can duplicate whatever\nour biggest time bonus is. It would just be great to\nhave a bigger time bonus. Okay  oh.\nWe're putting you back. Hello  we got our answer.\nIt's... It's a straight ass line. I mean  the angle really\ncould imply  actually  here. One of those things.\nIs that the... That weird development-y thing?\nYeah. There are only going to be\nso many spots with a straight line. Okay  look \nhe hasn't Cursed us. Do you want to ask for a photo?\nLet's do photo. Photo...\nTallest thing  I guess  right? I don't know.\nYeah. Let's get that in. Maybe he doesn't\nhave any more Curses? Alright. Predictably  they\nhave asked for a photo of the tallest thing I can see. What do we think that is? Light post  I guess?\nYeah  I think light post. Question answered.\nLet's quickly draw another card. Ten minute bonus. Not terrible. Now the real question is... Can we successfully cast\nthe Curse of the Gambler's Feet? I would say our dice rolling\nhas not been good so far. Needs to be an odd number. Here we go. Ohohoho  let's go. Oh  no. Curse of the Gambler's Feet. For the next hour \nSeekers must roll a die before they take any\nsteps in any direction. That's fine. Well  on the one hand \nI think we know where to go. I do think we know where to go. On the other hand  that's\ngonna take a minute. Well  now that we have this \nlet's just check the map and see if there's anywhere else where that angle\nreally seems to fit. I mean  there's\nthis one spot here  but that does not look like\nit would have a hiding spot. I think we should\nstart heading here. I do think that\nthat's not a bad idea. It's gonna take a minute. Alright.\nOne. Two. Six. (sighs)\nIt's gonna be close. I need more time bonus. Because what am I at now? 10 hours  50 minutes.\nI would need another... 2 hours  19 minutes. Oh. (whispering)\nDude  this sucks. We got a photo. We got a photo. That's not much. Let's do photo towards you. Maybe  is that\ngoing to be that helpful? I don't know  we'll see. Yeah  ask him\nphoto towards you. Alright  photo toward me. Now the real question is \ndo we get something good? Ideally  big time bonus.\nCome on. Curse of the Ransom Note. Curse of the Ransom Note. The next question\nthat the Seekers ask must be composed of\nwords and letters cut out of any printed material. Casting cost: Spell out\n\"Curse of the Ransom Note\" as a ransom note. Yeah  can't do that. I can't spell it out\nas a ransom note  so... That's useless.\nOh  that's not ideal. (groans) Hopefully they're walking slowly.\nHopefully Ben is walking slowly. Ben  you can normally\ncount on to walk slowly. And it's very uphill.\nIt's a very annoying walk. Ben is not going to\nbe happy about it. (bleep)\nTwo. Two. Six. We got a photo.\nOh  it's definitely in here. I mean  look. Look.\nIt's gotta be it. That's it.\nOkay  keep going. Just gotta get there.\nKeep rolling. Keep rolling. Gosh. I hate this. I— He— Ben you cast this on us. Yeah  I know \nbut he must have known! Ben is gonna be\nreally annoyed with me. And fair enough  you\nknow  fair enough. I did something very\nannoying to them. I do feel bad  but I had to do it.\nI had to do it. I had no choice. Keep rolling sixes  Sam. Look  here's the truth. I picked this area because\nit's hard to get to. But in terms of actually a\ngood hiding spot in here  there just isn't one. The key for me was this\nis closest to a street that runs sort of lightly\nnortheast to southwest  and there are two dozen\nstreets in this area like that. So hopefully they'll have\nto kind of explore a bit because there's a lot\nof similar streets. Until they find this one. These houses\ndefinitely look right. And let me show you. I'll give you some steps. Six. Let me show you where I think he is.\nHe has trees in his photos. There's not many trees that big.\nAnd that light view. That line. That line is right. Those trees are right. So I think we just\nneed to turn right here. Okay.\nGo straight down. And remember  as soon\nas we get him on camera  we've caught him.\nSo we can start— stop rolling. Okay  keep going.\nThat'd be fun. One  two  three  four. They are getting closer. They are only a few minutes away. I don't think that... laying down on the bench\nis really gonna do much  but it is worth a try. One  two  ah! Crawl  crawl for it.\nNo  I got six from that. Two  three  four  five. Two  five. There he is. Ben's coming to kill you.\nHe's coming to kill you. That sucked. And I know that we're gonna have\nto do that tomorrow morning. There's a bus.\nOh  is there? Oh  god.\nYeah. Oh  a bus would\nhave been lovely. Yeah  I didn't\ntake the bus either. I realized it as I was walking up.\nOh  you got a Shinkansen... Yeah  isn't that cute? Ugh. It's pretty good  though. It's a strong second place. For now. Ugh!\nAlright  goodbye. Alright  Sam. Last run.\nSee you at Narita Airport. As in  not  I'm gonna\nhide there again. As in  I'm not gonna see you.\nYeah  yeah. No  we  yeah  we got that.\nOkay  bye. Bye! I almost had it  almost.\nAlmost had it. Here's the thing \nbecause I had a duplicate too. So with one 30 minute bonus  it would have turned into\ntwo 30 minute bonuses. That would have\nbeen pretty good. Nearly  nearly. Oh  a strong second place.\nA strong second place. And I'm excited to\ntry to defend your first place spot\ntomorrow. The boys are back together \nand we are going to lock in a first and second place\nand secure a Sam third place. Yeah  yeah  for sure.\nOnce again. (outdoor ambience) Good morning  jet laggers.\nWelcome to the final day. Good morning.\nGood morning! It is the final day \nthe final round. Here's the deal. We need to find Sam today.\nYeah. Or our goose  our geese \nI should say... Yeah  they will be cooked. Mostly  at this point \nwe just need to figure out a general direction\nto start looking. Yeah. And we think a\ngood way to do that could be by asking if he's\nin the same region as us. They have asked  am I\nin the same region as them? They're in the Chūbu region. That's a good question for them because they're pretty\nclose to the border between the regions with that.\nI get to pull three cards. One  two  three. Okay. Oh. So I do have... a move card. Move. Discard your hand\nand send the Hiders the location of your transit station. This card grants the player\n60 minutes to establish a new hiding zone\nsomewhere else on the game map. The Seekers are frozen\nand your hiding time is paused until this new hiding period\nis concluded. This card cannot be played\nduring the endgame. And a move card... That's influential.\nI'm absolutely keeping this. That is a really valuable card. I mean  I remember when we\nwere designing this game  we were really\ngoing back and forth on whether we wanted\nto include it  just because it's of its\npotential power  you know? I can't play this\nonce they're here  but if I see them\ncoming towards here... I could really waste a lot\nof their time  I think  by going somewhere\ncompletely different. This  honestly \nthe more I think about it... the more I think that \nby the end of this day  this card could be the thing\nthat wins me the game.

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nto the finale of our six-day game of\nhide-and-seek across Japan. As a final reminder  in this game \nthe Hider is given three and a half hours\nto get to a hiding place  starting from where\nthe previous Hider was found. Then it's up to the Seekers\nto find the Hider as quickly as possible by asking questions\nfrom the question menu. In exchange for truthful answers  the Hider gets to draw\nadvantages from the Hider deck. After five days of gameplay \nBen sits in a commanding first place with a time of\n13 hours and 9 minutes  with Adam in second at\n11 hours  21 minutes. Those won't be easy times to beat \nbut at the start of my run  something happened that\ncould change everything. After Ben and Adam's first question \nabout what region I was in  I pulled the Move card  the single most powerful\ncard in the deck  which allows me to spend one hour\ntraveling to a new hiding spot at any point before the endgame. No other player has\npulled this card so far  meaning no one has any experience\ndealing with its implications. So without further ado  the finale of\nhide-and-seek across Japan. (chuckles) So I do have a Move card. And a Move card... That's influential.\nI'm absolutely keeping this. That is a really valuable card. I mean  I remember when we\nwere designing this game  we were really going back and forth\non whether we wanted to include it  just because it's...\nof its potential power  you know? I can't play this once they're here  but if I see them\ncoming towards here... I could really waste\na lot of their time  I think  by going somewhere\ncompletely different. This  honestly \nthe more I think about it... the more I think that\nby the end of this day  this card could be the thing\nthat wins me the game. Here's the deal.\nWe need to find Sam today. Yeah.\nOr our goose... Or geese  I should say.\nYeah  they will be cooked. If Sam wins  then he\nwill go into the lead in his all-time\nJet Lag win record. Yes  and we cannot\nallow that to happen. If you win  then\nI think we're all tied. If you can believe it.\nWouldn't that be so nice. Wouldn't that be pretty fun. Ben  I have what\nI would say is good news. He is not in the same region as us. Okay  great. I would say that\nthis is quite good news and means that we should\nproceed on to Tokyo. Because this means\nthat wherever he is  he went via Tokyo or\nthe general Tokyo area. Yeah  I'm quite pleased.\nI'm feeling pleased. We cannot be fooled.\nWe are foolproof. We are foolproof. One last look at... Where are we? So  here's the deal. I'm not gonna lie.\nI don't love my hiding spot. I'll give Adam credit. He might not have had\na winning run with his spot  but he at least\nreally forced my hand with some tough geography. Basically  I had three options. I could have gone west \nkind of back to Kōfu  and then explored some of\nthe rural lines around there. Although  to be honest  the profile of the kind of spot\nI would have hidden in would have been\npretty similar to yesterday's but with even fewer options. The other option was  I could come to the\nnear Shinkansen lines  get as geographically far as I can. And I really considered that.\nI looked at a lot of options. However  ultimately \nI just wouldn't have had enough time to actually transfer\nonto another line. So pretty much I would have had\nto hide on a Shinkansen stop. And I considered that.\nI mean  nobody's tried that. However  there were not\nthat many Shinkansen stops you could even get to  and there were a lot of unique\nfeatures of each of them. So  that left me with\nthe third option. Hiding in the biggest urban area in the entire world. You think he's in...\njust the Tokyo metro area? I mean  look  that was sort of the little feeling\nI got this morning  is if Sam wants to\ntry a new strategy... It's true. It could make sense to be like  maybe just being in\nthe densest possible place is the way to go. I think the unfortunate\nthing for him is... we did a pretty good job\nof designing the game in such a way that I don't think that\nthe Tokyo metro area is actually overpowered\nin the way you might hope. No  in fact \nwe got to Japan early and tested to make sure\nthat that exact thing was not overpowered. So if he is in Tokyo  we know how to play that game.\nYeah. You know  the more I think\nabout this Move card... the more I realize that... I might have a bit of\nan OP combo here. Because  you know  normally  from most locations that\nwe've hidden in so far  you know  you're on one train line. And therefore  in 60 minutes \nthe number of options of train stations you can get to\nis not very many. But again  I'm in the biggest\nurban area in the entire world. And therefore \nthe number of train stations I can get to in 60 minutes... It's  I mean  well into\nthe hundreds  I think. I gotta tell you  Ben.\nI got some pretty gnarly blisters. Oh yeah  my feet\nare (bleep)-ed up. I would say that if you are\nplaying the home game  I would not necessarily\nrecommend playing it for six days straight \n11 to 12 hours a day. Yeah  I think just sort of have\na chill  fun time with it instead. Yeah  I mean  you can play it for\nsix days straight for 11 to 12 hours a day.\nI'm not gonna stop you. But I would say that it is gonna\n(bleep) your feet up a little bit. Alright  we made it\nback to the station. Whee.\nWe're gonna make this train. Whee! And we're off to Tokyo. Whee! What do you think we want to do\nwhen we get to Tokyo? What do I think we want to do\nwhen we get to Tokyo? I... ...want to go eat some ramen and have... sushi. I think we got time for that.\nCould be nice. Oof. Oh  Ben.\nYeah  even just... Yeah  I know  I know.\n...ten steps up. I think the thing once we\nget to Tokyo is just like... \"Hey man  are\nyou in Tokyo or no?\" Is he in Tokyo? Look at how\nnarrow this house is. How do you—\nWhat do you put there? Looks like Ben and\nAdam have completed the long walk\ndown to the station. And I have to imagine they're now gonna\ntake the train east towards  you know \nTokyo  towards here. I'm gonna go explore my zone a bit. There's no point in\nlooking for a hiding spot since I think I'll move... you know  to a different area\nbefore they search  but I mean  might as well keep\nmy eye out just in case  I don't know  something...\nI don't know what would change. I mean  I want to play this card. (gong ringing) You're not in there. You're not in there. I think you have to go...\nIt's a different place  Adam. It's not on there. Where is that?\nI don't even know where that is. Time to get on the train  Ben. Off to Tokyo! Wheee-EEEEEE!\nWheee! So when we get to Tokyo  I think... We just  we hit him\nwith a big Radar. Radar... 25  50? You thought we\nweren't gonna go to Tokyo and hit you with a big Radar?\nWrong again. Looks like Ben and Adam\nare heading towards Tokyo. So they must be waiting to do... I don't know  some\nRadar or region thing or something like that\nfor their second question. I guess they're\nplaying conservatively. Little do they know... I might have already pulled\nthe best card in the deck. So  you know. That's helpful. If he's in Tokyo \nwe've got the tools to defeat him... handily. Handily. Okay? You thought we couldn't\ndefeat Sam handily? Wrong again. They keep being\nwrong about stuff. They keep making so many\nwrong assumptions. I know. It's making\nthem look pretty stupid. Yeah  well... That's what they get\nfor underestimating us. God  I hope we finish\nthis round in three hours. It'd be awesome. Sort of an\nanticlimactic finale. Check these out.\nIt's like  it's carved. Like gourds  I guess? I mean  maybe  or\nweirdly shapen pumpkins. Yeah. It's a Christmas pumpkin.\nOf course. Hello. Our train has been\ndelayed for a while here. Yeah  we've been stopped\nfor 10  maybe 15 minutes. Which is unfortunate \nbecause there's also not... There aren't really any other trains\nwe can take out of here. But you know what? We don't need this time.\nIt's fine. We're just having\na relaxing morning. It doesn't even matter.\nIt's not even gonna matter. And I'm not even worried.\nI'm not even worried. Are you worried?\nI'm not even worried. How could I even be worried?\nYou couldn't. Because there's nothing\nto be worried about. (vocal frying) Okay  I've come to McDonald's. To be honest  mostly\njust sitting near AC  but I'm gonna try... I'm gonna try this  which apparently is like\nshrimp chicken nuggets. And I will give you my review. Yeah. The doors just closed.\nYeah. The doors just— Hey!\nHere we go  here we go. (hums faux-Italian ditty) Good stuff. We're on the move again. Hello. Now that we're\ngetting sort of close to the center of Tokyo \nwe figure now might be a good time to start a Thermometer. Little Thermometer \nkinda cut the area in half  east-west wise.\nChop it up  chop it up. Because we happen to be on a line that goes pretty much\nexactly west to east. And it's like  look \nas while we're on it  Might as well.\nmight as well chop it. Because the thing is \nthere's so many lines. We're not gonna be able to\nfigure this out by being like  \"Well  he could have gone this way.\nHe could have gone—\" We're just going to\nhave to chop the area up It's why they call us—\ninto smaller and smaller pieces. It's why they call us\nthe chopping boys. They call us the chopping boys. 'Cause  on account of\nhow we love to chop. Alright  our Thermometer\nhas been played. We've played our\nwonderful Thermometer  Ben. I think it's probably\ngonna be hotter  but it'll be nice to have\nthat good clean line. Alright  they've ended\ntheir Thermometer  and it will cut Tokyo\nkind of in two. Which is not great \nbut honestly  if I saw this  and I was the Seeker \nI might  you know... take the Shinkansen up to Takasaki\nand check that area out. We've all been assuming that people will take\nthe Shinkansen somewhere. And  I think Takasaki\nis still in play. I definitely could've gotten there. Ohh! It's colder. That is really\ninteresting news. This is a very limited area.\nOne of the bigger chops we've seen. I would say\nthe bigger the chop... Mhm.\n...the happier I am. Yeah  you love a big chop.\nYeah. We're about to get\ninto Shinjuku Station. Yeah  we should just get off. We're just— I think—\nYeah  we'll just get off here. Alright. Welcome to the busiest\ntrain station in the world. Shinjuku. Alright  let's try\nto find somewhere to... ...figure out what this means.\nYeah. Alright  let's pull our cards. One. Two. Ten minute bonus. Discard one  draw two. Well  that's not awesome. I guess I'll keep the\ndiscard one  draw two. Might come in handy later. We'll see. This looks like food. Okay  hello. Because we've done such a good job  we've decided to reward ourselves\nwith some sushi. Okay  what the heck\ndo we do next? How do we feel about\na little Radar? I feel relatively good\nabout a 50 mile Radar. You want to hit it? Let's just do it.\nOkay. We're just going\nto keep chopping. Hopefully it's a hit. Alright  they've asked\nfor a 50 mile Radar. That is for sure going to be a hit. It's going to more or less\nconfirm from them that I'm in an urban area\nin or around Tokyo. They're not going to\nlike that  honestly. I would not be pleased\nwith Seeking... in the area I am now. If that's a hit  I'd say\nwe're doing quite well. If it's a miss  I'd say... our next move is gonna matter a lot. I would agree with that. It's a hit. Okay  that's good. It makes our lives\na lot simpler from here. There's a lot of weird possibilities\nthat we don't have to worry about. What we need to do now\nis get a better map. Okay  we're gonna\ngo work on a little map. And then we're gonna\ncome back to you with some conclusions.\nWe're gonna work on a map. I don't have a good\noutro for this clip. Let's draw our next card. One. Two. Oh man. Just keep getting these.\nHere's what I'll do. I'll keep the discard one  draw two\nand then use it as a discard with one of the other\ndiscard one  draw twos. And another two. Five minute bonus and\nCurse of the Bridge Troll. Curse of the Bridge Troll. The Seekers must ask\ntheir next question from under a bridge. Casting cost: The Seekers must\nbe at least 50 miles from you. Curse of the Bridge Troll. Well  I guess they have\nto be 50 miles away. Could be better  to be honest. I mean  aside from \nof course  the Move card. That's clutch. You can't do\nany cool stuff here. That's true. They really don't want\nyou to do anything cool. Alright  chopping boys\nreporting back in. We've drawn this.\nThis is the area that we're in. And I think there can be\nalmost no doubt that we should do\na 25 mile Radar. Which will basically tell us  \"Hey  are you in\nall of this really dense \"Tokyo kind of greater metro area  or are you sort of\nmore out in the weeds?\" And then we get\na tiny little semicircle  which is a nice  good chop \nor we get a little donut. We get a big  sort of\nbizarre part of a donut. Yeah. And if we get that  then \nI'm not quite sure what we do  but I know that we'll\nfigure it out together. Yay! Chopping boys! Alright  another question. It's a 25 mile Radar.\nIt is a hit. That's gonna really tell\nthem that I'm in Tokyo. But  that's still\nquite a few options. One. And two. These have got to be good  right?\nCome on. Oh  we got a randomize.\nRandomize is not bad. I'll keep the randomize  for sure. Yeah  no  the randomize\nwill be good. Okay  yet another report\nfrom the chopping boys. We've got our answer. Ben  it's a hit.\nIt's a hit  okay. Now  this is some very\ninteresting information. That means he's\nonly 25 miles from us. (sniffs) I can smell him. I feel quite good about this. I feel like we've been—\nNo  I know. No  I do too  I do too. We've been cutting\nwith great aplomb. I would say we're getting\nclose to Tentacles territory. I mean  the trouble is \nthis is 50 miles across. So I actually think we need\nto try to chop this guy again. My opinion is \nlet's walk a half mile  either north or south \nask if we're hotter or colder  and then we go to the center\nof whatever area we have left and we do a Tentacles.\nThat's what I have to say to you. Alright  let's go south.\nAlright  fine by me. Rev up that Thermometer. Well  thermometers  which\nfamously have to be revved up. Rev it up. This is sort of what\nthermometers are always doing. We're using a\nvery old fashioned one. Right  they require engines.\nIt's gas powered. Oop-a! Alright  they're starting\na half-mile Thermometer. This could be interesting. I wonder which slice\nthey'll try to... you know  slice off. Beep  beep  beep. ♪ Thermometer ♪ Beep  beep  beep. ♪ Thermometer ♪ That's a cool song.\nHow does the rest of it go? That's the whole song. Woo!\nWoo! Woo!\nWoo! Woo!\nYeah. Alright  we're done.\nOkay  Thermometer complete. Sam... are you north\nor are you south? I am north. They've gone south. So  it's a colder. Do you think\nhe's north or south? Well  actually  Ben \nI know the answer because he just texted us\nthat he is north. Okay  well. I don't really have\nan opinion on that. I was gonna be fine either way. Let's go back\nto Shinjuku Station and then we'll head straight there.\nWe go to the middle. You freaking Tentacle his ass. And we're gonna\nTentacle his ass. His ass is\ngonna get Tentacled. It really doesn't\nsound good to say that. No  oh  man.\nWe really shouldn't. No  no.\nWe should not say that. Another card pull. One  two. Ten minute bonus. Oh  we can... make them strap\nsome lemons on. Curse of the Lemon Phylactery. Before asking another question \nthe Seekers must each find a lemon and affix it to the outermost\nlayer of their clothes or skin. Casting cost: Discard a powerup. That's always a fun one. I'd say we just hit it now.\nCould be fun. Let's figure it out.\nBen... It's lemon time.\nOkay  let's go. When Sam gives you lemons \nyou tape them to your body. Yep  that's what they say.\nThat's the old saying. Here we go.\nThis is what Sam and I used. Okay  grocery store. It's lemon time. Well  I see limes. Ah  wonderful. In fact  we can get\na lovely little two pack. Whoa! Perfect. And they designed\nthat for if you're playing hide-and-seek 2.0\nwith two Seekers. Oh  I should. What? This is that thing\nI was telling you about. Ohhh. Lemons acquired. And once we're all\nlemoned up  as a reward  we can have our little ice creams.\nYaaay! I'm gonna try to\ndo this not too tightly. I don't think that\nthese lemons are falling off. Alright  lemons attached. We're about to head to the middle of the region Sam could be at \nto Tentacle his ass. But really quickly \nwe have to make a stop in the Snack Zone. This is one of the\ngreatest inventions in the history of mankind. Ben  I'd like to submit\nmy theory right now. Mhm?\nSam is in Kawagoe. Mhm. Kawagoe is called \"Little Edo\" because it has a lot of\nreally cool Edo architecture. I think that might be where he is. Mmm  mhm. Alright  I've had\nenough sitting around. I'm gonna just look around a bit.\nSee what I can find. Okay  now I've found\nsome cool stuff. Unfortunately... literally this street\nis the limit of my zone. But look how cool the shops are. This is apparently what\nthis town is more known for. Apparently it was\nlike a wealthy spot back in the Edo period\nor whatever. Oh man  that looks so cool. Alright  looks like\nthey finally left Shinjuku  and are headed north \ntowards me. But  they don't have\nenough info  yet  to know it's here. Right? Yeah. Yeah  no. I mean  the main thing I need to do \nconsidering I have that great card is not (bleep) it up. And make sure I actually leave here\nbefore they get here. So I do have to pay good\nattention to the tracker. Alright  Ben. It's the Se-bu-buh... It's the She—\nSeibu Shinjuku Line Limited on platform three. It really is stairs.\nThe stairs are the killer. Not good.\nOh. Hello.\nHello. We are almost to the center\nof the remaining map. I think we hit the zoo Tentacles. Yeah  we were looking.\nThere's a lot of zoos around here. Alright  I'm gonna send them. Yeah  I think if\nwe've done our work right... then... then this will tell us where he is. Okay  we're pulling into... ...\"Torokozawa\". What time does\nthis train leave  Ben? We need to get off. It's going to leave before we get—\nI think we need to get off. We'll wait off the train  and we can hop back\non if we need to. Okay  okay. If this hits  and the zoo is north  we want to get right\nback on this train. Yeah. We need an answer \nwe need an answer! I have acquired... ...something like a\ncaramel  I don't know. It looked good. Mmm. Yeah. Okay  bad news.\nI've been Tentacled. I am within 15 miles  and one of the zoos\nis rather close to me. So that's gonna narrow things down\nquite a lot  quite quickly. So  I'm near one of\nthe train stations. I think I'm actually going to\ngo to the other train station. Because I think that one\nis higher frequency in case I need to\nquickly use my Move card. Yeah. This train's\ngoing to leave in... Oh. Okay. Oh  we did get an answer.\nOh  it is a hit. Okay  it's a hit?\nIt's... Okay  well  we should've\nstayed on the train. It's fine  it's fine. There's another one\nin a few minutes. Okay  this zoo is up—\nit's up by Kawagoe. It's up by Kawagoe \nlike I said! I think you might've called it.\nMight've called it! Might have called it!\nThis train is going now. Might have called it! I almost forgot\nto do my card pull. It's a beefy one.\nI get to pull four  pick two. One  two  three  four. Oh  five minutes  ten minutes.\nZoologist. Curse of the Zoologist. Take a photo of a wild fish  bird \nmammal  reptile  amphibian  or bug. The Seekers must take a\npicture of a wild animal in the same category\nbefore asking another question. Urban Explorer. Curse of the Urban Explorer. For the rest of your run \nSeekers cannot ask questions when they are on transport\nor in a transit station. Casting cost: Discard two cards. I think I'll keep\nthe two Curses. I think I'll play the Urban Explorer while discarding the Zoologist\nand the five minute bonus. That'll slow them down for sure. We're getting on this train. We have just been hit with a Curse.\nOkay. For the rest of your run \nSeekers cannot ask questions when they are on transit\nor in a transit station. Hmm  that's not a great\nCurse for him to pull now. No. Would've been good\nfor him to pull earlier. No  and he had to discard\ntwo cards to play that  too. Yeah  I think he knows\nhe's in twubble. So  I guess we're— I was gonna just say we\nshould ask for a photo  but... Let's just go there.\nLet's just go there and then we'll figure\nit out from there. Alright  they're definitely\non the train that terminates here. If they don't get off in\nthe next couple of minutes  I'm gonna have to play this card. I don't have an option  I think  because I cannot risk\nplaying it too late once they've gotten within my zone \nbecause then it's invalid. So probably in about\nthe next five minutes  I need to decide\nwhether I'm playing it. Guess we'll see him in Kawagoe.\nKawagoe. I may have called it. I feel like I may have\nkind of called it. I would say that\nat the very least we're close enough now that it would be fair\nto say you called it. Whee. I love having called it. Well done. I think we've got him.\nI think we've got him. Alright  time to go.\nThey passed it. We gotta go. Move. Discard your hand\nand send the Hiders the location of your\ntransit station. This card grants the\nplayer 60 minutes to establish a new hiding zone\nsomewhere else on the game map. The Seekers are frozen \nand your hiding timer is paused until this new hiding\nperiod has concluded. This card cannot be\nplayed during the endgame. Oh boy  I'm glad\nI had this card. Alright  welcome to Kawagoe. So we need to leave\nthe station to ask a question. I think what we do is leave here\nand ask for tallest building. Because I also think\nthere's a good chance this is where he is  and then he will say\nhe can't answer  and then that'll confirm\nwe're in the endgame. Right  right  right. Where is the exit? This seems to be a mall. Okay  interesting. Oh... Adam  Adam.\nYeah  yeah? What? I  uh... Ben  what? No.\nMhm. He pulled the one Move. No.\nHe pulled the one Move. No  he didn't.\nOkay  wait  wait  wait  okay. Okay  wait  wait  wait  wait.\nSo that means... He's on the move. I don't know where I'm going. I'm just kind of vibing\nit out at this point. We'll see where I get off.\nI'll just do it on feel  I guess. Oh  Jesus  okay. This is sort of the only thing\nthat could have gone wrong. We have to figure out where\nhe could be going right now. Wait  wait  wait. He has to\nsend us what his station... It was this station. This was his station.\nOkay  okay  okay  okay. Okay  we are stuck\nfor an hour while he moves. This hour does not count\ntowards his time. (bleep) (bleep) We had him. I know. He was here. We got him.\nOkay. This was going to be\nthe fastest catch of the game. Okay  let's go sit down. Let's go sit down. Okay  we need\nto start researching how far he can get in an hour. Starting at 2 pm.\nYeah. I don't think he could\nhave gotten that far. No  that's true. Well  I mean \nhe could have gotten— He's moving right now. Okay  okay.\nSo we also— Here's the other question\nwe have to ask ourselves. What's the most annoying\npossible line he could get on? Because that's the one\nhe'll try to get on. You know what I mean? Yeah. (grunting) We have time  we have time.\nIt's gonna be okay. We're gonna get it sorted out. Son of a (bleep) We had him. We literally had him.\nThat's crazy. It's crazy how much we had him. Okay  I think we're\ngonna go for the next stop. I'm just not sure  I don't know. Just 'cause. Okay  I am... here. To be honest  I didn't really...\ngo anywhere with purpose. I just got on the first train I saw\nand got off on a random stop  because  chaos theory  right? If I don't know where I'm going \nhow will they know where I'm going? The trouble is  we've already\nused a lot of our good questions. We've used our\nhalf mile Thermometer. What if we asked about\nhis proximity to a major airport? Yeah?\nThat would tell us  did he go up\nor did he go down? Right  because\nall of those airports  like Haneda and Narita \nare pretty just clearly that way. Yeah. Alright  it's 2:59. Right when it hits 3 \nwe're gonna ask our question. 10 seconds.\nAlright. Mm-kay  let's go. (deflates) Are you closer to or further\nfrom your nearest major airport? So  they're asking basically  am I further from\nmy closest major airport? So that should give\nthem some direction. Let me check  I don't actually know. Sam  we are not gonna\nlet this give you the win. He's closer.\nOkay  that means he went in. Okay.\nOkay. Now I'm going to ask\nif he's closer to or further from a major city center. But we can't do that in here. Right  right.\nOkay  let's get out of here. Okay.\nWhere is the exit? I literally don't know. It's gotta be through\nthis stupid mall  right? Okay  let's go\nthrough this stupid mall. Three cards. One. Curse of the\nMediocre Travel Agent. Choose any publicly accessible place within a half mile of the\nSeekers' current location. They must go there  spend\nat least ten minutes there  and acquire a souvenir before\nasking another question. Casting cost:\nTheir vacation destination must be further from you\nthan their current location. Two. Curse of the Jammed Door. For the next three hours \nthe Seekers must roll dice to pass through a doorway. Casting cost: Discard a card. Three. Curse of the Drained Brain. Choose three questions\nin different categories. The Seekers cannot\nask those questions for the rest of your run. Casting cost: Discard your hand. Those are good ones. I think I gotta keep the\njammed door one  right? Problem is I can't play it yet\nbecause I don't have another card I could discard with it. Okay  now that we are\nout of the station again  we're asking if he is closer to\nor further from a major city. Hopefully he's closer. Because then that gives us\nsmall areas that we can deal with. Oh my god  oh  we...\nI know. We would've had him by now.\nI know  I know  I know. Okay  already hit me\nwith another one. Am I closer or further\nfrom nearest major city? Another card pull. And one  two  three. Veto's pretty valuable.\nI'm gonna keep Veto  yeah  for sure. He's closer  that's good.\nThat's good. That's really good.\nOkay. So the Tokyo area is weird. It has four things\nthat qualify as cities: Tokyo  Kawasaki \nYokohama  and Saitama. The good news is that Tokyo \nYokohama  and Kawasaki are all sort of clumped together. Saitama is sort of up by itself.\nSo what I think we should do is sort of go roughly to\nthe center of Saitama and Tentacle there \nand if it's a miss  then we know he's in the\nsort of big super group down by Yokohama \nKawasaki  and Tokyo. Alright  gonna\nexplore my new zone. Let's see what we got. It's nice  it's quieter\nthan where I was. Okay  we got some park\naction up in here. Let's check out the park. We got a little lake. It's very peaceful in here. I'm gonna get some ice cream. Oh  legs. Oh (bleep) Damn you  Sam. You okay?\nYes. We're getting on this \nwe're going to Ōmiya  so that we can check the first bubble around Saitama. Oh  the stairs.\nYeah  the stairs. This was all part of his plan. Alright  Ben \nI'm ready to send it the second we step out.\nAlright. Alright  hit him. And boom. Amusement park Tentacles. Alright  I've been Tentacled. Draw four  pick two. One  two  three  four. Ugh  okay. I guess I'll just keep the\n15 and 20 minute bonuses. Those are not bad. Not the greatest pull \nbut that's alright. Ben  it's a hit.\nIt's a hit? Okay  okay  good stuff  man. Okay  he's closest\nto the one near us. That's good.\nThat's good to know. Okay  just give me a sec here.\nYep. So this is a\npretty limited area  but not as limited as\nI would have quite liked. No. We need to find a way\nto cut this down more. I'm wondering if there's\nanything else we can ask? Distance from coastline? I guess that would\njust pretty directly tell us if he was south.\nCut this in half. I like that \ndistance from coastline? Yeah. New question.\nDistance to coastline. One  two... Three. Veto  ten minute bonus \nCurse of the Census Taker. Curse of the Census Taker. The Seekers must immediately\nvisit a town or city hall within a mile of their\ncurrent location. When there  they must\nestimate the population under that town hall's jurisdiction and get the answer\ncorrect within 25%. Otherwise  you are awarded\nan extra 30 minutes. Casting cost: The Seekers'\nnext question is free. As far as I can tell  I can't see a city hall\nnear their station  so I think I'm just going\nto take the 10 minute bonus  'cause I already have another veto. Closer. Okay  Sam's\ncloser to the coast. So that cuts off \nI think  more lines. He's gotta be\nsomewhere in here. Yeah.\nThat's not a very big area. You want a picture of\nthe tallest thing he can see and get on a train south?\nYeah  I think... I think that we want to be\nable to start working on that. Because I also think there's\na good chance that as we go  we might be able to\njust pick it out. And we're going to\nwant those pictures before the sun sets. Alright. We got it  buddy. Alright  gotta go\nback to the station. They're asking for a photo\nof the tallest thing. I would not be surprised if they're\njust gonna try to ride the line and see if they spot it. Ah  this isn't looking good. There's a pretty  pretty\nunique looking building that looks like it\nmight be the tallest. Adam  I think this is the\nmascot of Ōmiya or something. Whoa! Hai  konnichiwa! Okay.\nDid you get it on camera? Oh  yeah.\nThat's awesome! We get on the JK line.\nAlright. There's nothing JK\nabout this  though. We ain't kidding around. Boy  just to tell you\nhow fried my brain is... I went to check the time to see\nwhen this train was gonna be here  and I checked my lemon. Yeah  this is not looking good. They're definitely gonna be able\nto identify that from the train. Okay  well  here's the station exit. That building is\ndefinitely the tallest. So  I'll send that along. Alright  let's go.\nIt's pretty distinct. Well  we'll watch for it.\nSee if maybe we can match it. Okay  wait \nno  I don't think so. No  no. No  I don't think it\ncould be any of these. Oh wait  no  no.\nBut that looks similar again. It's something like that. You know what I mean?\nYeah. Wait  wait  wait  what's that? You see that? No  that's not it. Minor update.\nThey took the wrong line. It's gonna be a little bit longer. No  but it's close.\nYeah  it's somewhere. Okay  let's get off. Let's get the hell out of here. Alright. I think a distance from\nnearest Shinkansen is good. I think it... clears that line in a way that is pretty convenient. Yeah  I think so. Okay. Another question. Am I closer or further\nto a Shinkansen? I am basically right on top\nof a Shinkansen line. It goes right through my station \nso I'm definitely closer. Sam is closer.\nCloser. Okay. Okay  so that means\nhe's basically right on the Shinkansen line.\nYeah  okay. We've got it down to\nreally just these stations. Yeah. So it's one of these. There's a train in five minutes to Musashi-Urawa.\nYeah  let's get on it. I'll say it's starting\nto get a little bit late. The sun is going down.\nIt's... I think we're still okay. But I am starting to get worried. We only have about\n45 minutes before the sun sets. Yeah  and also doing it in... a dense  such a city area \nis going to be really hard. Yeah.\nThere are way more streets. Yep. The thing that\ndense metro areas are best at is the endgame.\nYep. Another three card pulls. Two  three.\nCurse of the Bird Guide. Curse of the Bird Guide. You have one chance to film a bird\nfor as long as possible  up to 15 minutes straight. If at any point the\nbird leaves the frame  your timer is stopped. The Seekers must then film a bird for the same amount\nof time or longer before asking another question. 15 minute bonus.\nDiscard two  draw three. You know  I think I'll take\nthe discard two  draw three  and see if I can optimize my\ntime bonuses at this point. Alright  one  two  three. 10 minute bonus  10 minute bonus  15 minute— wow \nthat worked out well. Alright  so I have\n15  25  35  50  70  80. 80 minutes of time bonuses.\nNot bad. Yeah  I don't\nthink that it's here. Train in five minutes\nto Nishi-Urawa. You wanna just go? Yeah  I think  let's\njust keep riding the line and checking before\nwe ask any more questions. Adam  I think I see it.\nYou think you see it? I think I might have seen it.\nWhere? Over there.\nI can't quite see it anymore. That would mean that it\nwould be not on this tra— That's gotta be it.\nThat's gotta be it. Yeah  I saw it too. Over there. So we're gonna need\nto go up one station. It's gotta be it  right there. Right there.\nI think that's it  yeah. Okay  so we'll connect up. Do you know where that is? Yeah  yeah  I do. It's Naka-Urawa. Sumimasen. Okay  so we need to go back. Yeah  this is us. Sam  I think we\nmight just finally  finally have you. Yeah.\nThat's the one for sure. Yeah  yeah. Yeah  that's it. Alright  this is us off here \nand then connect up one and stop. Let's kick it. Here  here  it's over here. That's it. We gotta get out of the station\nbefore we can ask a question. Final endgame of the game.\nLet's hope... ...we can make it a quick one. Okay  what do you think?\nYou want to do a one mile Tentacle? Yeah  what do you—\nWhat kind of Tentacle? Here  you take this.\nI'll figure it out. Hospital's gonna give us\nthe best directionality. Four. Is it worth the cards? Uhm... In my opinion  yeah.\nOkay. God  I wish I\nhadn't lost my glasses. Do you  because\nyou kind of have a similar prescription as me.\nPut on my sunglasses. Plus you look so cool. Show the audience\nhow cool you look. You look like a bug. Lemons—\nHe's responded. Hayashi. Okay  so we want to head up... Wait  really quickly  ask for a photo of the\ntallest thing he can see before he can Curse us.\nJust in case. Okay. We've sent tallest thing he can see \nand he didn't Curse us  so this should be\nenough to find him. Alright  let's start\nheading towards that hospital. Okay. There's a park  Ben. Maybe we should start\nby checking the park. Okay  start heading\ntowards the park. Sam  are you in the park?\nPlease just be in the park. I'm only going to put these on\nwhen I need to be searching closely. Because while they do\nmake me see better  they also make things darker.\nYeah. It's some random\n(bleep)-ing building. So it doesn't seem\nlike he's in the park. Okay. I mean  this building\nis just like a house. Yeah. It's quite generic. But also  if that's the\ntallest thing he can see  that actually does\nnarrow things down a bit. I guess  yeah  because it's like  from here I can see that \nand that's taller. Right. So it can't be anywhere\nthat you can see that. Can't be anywhere you can see that. I think with\ntallest thing stre— Is that it? Is that the tallest building? It does look a lot\nlike the right house. Agh  it might not quite be right. But it looks really similar \ndoesn't it? It does. I just scared a man.\nThat was a normal man. That was a normal...\nI just scared a poor man. Normal man. Not Sam.\nSam's not a normal man. No. I don't think it is this.\nBut almost! It's very similar. But I suppose it makes sense\nthat there are several houses that have that kind\nof look out here. Should we ask something else?\nWe still don't have a... Yeah  yeah. Photo of you?\nYeah  photo of him. Get a photo of him. Does not seem like\nwe should be walking here. No. It's not that  is it? The back of that house?\nI don't think so. Again  it's a similar building.\nNo. It's very similar. He's under something. He's under a bridge. Okay  we should\nbe able to find that. Under what bridge\ncan you see a house? Well  there's\na bridge over there. Oh? No  it's not this bridge. Not this bridge. Ugh  I hate\nendgames in dense areas. Yeah  there's a lot to look at. What is he under? Okay  let's... (bleep) Let's go this way\nand then turn left. I think it'd be close\nfor it to count  but there's definitely a bridge\nthere by the station. Let's look at the bridges\nnear  I mean... Let's go to the river. There are definitely\nbridges on the river. And where there are bridges \nthere may be Sam. Okay. There's actually a smaller river\nthat I think might be a better fit. Just one street over.\nRight. We just need to cross. (whispering)\nI think they're almost here. Oh yeah  look at this...\nLook at this little river. Yeah  that's what I'm saying. Sam  are you under there? Let's walk alongside\nthis river  maybe. Saa-aam? But none of the houses match.\n(mouthing) They're up there. But  I think it's worth a shot. I certainly think it\ncould be this river. It's like  he would barely even... He would really\nbarely be hit by a... Oh no  but I guess he would be. Hi.\nOh  there he is! Hi. Wait  turn the flash on.\nYou can't see him. There he is. Hi. Hey  Sam.\nHow's it going? That was really annoying\nwhen you moved. Oh  man!\nYeah? Ohh! Sorry  fellas. I think that it's time for\nus to go back to Tokyo Station. Yeah.\nFor something very important. We've taken so many trains. This time I think we\nshould do the teleporter. You ready? That was an option\nthe whole time? One  two  three! Whoa! Whoa!\nWe're back at Tokyo Station! We made it back safe and sound. Ben  as the person\nwith the longest hiding time. Yes. Of 13 hours and\nnine minutes  I think... Mhm.\nPretty long. Mhm. We can now congratulate you on being the winner\nof Jet Lag season 12! Woo! Thank you. I'm so excited. I think that this means\nthat we are all tied for wins. That is true. I think we're\nall tied at five? This really raises\nthe stakes for next season. It's true  it does. Ben  I did have a feeling\nthis would happen  because I believe in you so much. When Adam and I were\non a run earlier... Yeah? We saw  it was actually\na crazy coincidence. They had a machine\nthat was  said  \"Jet Lag season 12\ntrophy gacha.\" That's true  we can cut\nto that footage. Yeah  I mean \nI'm not making this up. Perfect.\nYeah. Whoa  they really have\neverything in this country. They really do.\nIt's amazing. Whoa  this is amazing.\nOpen it up! Wooaaaah!\nWoooaah! Oh my god— How did\nthey fit that in there? I can't believe\nthat's only 500 yen. Yeah  that's— The yen\nis really weak right now. It is not doing well. Oh my god \nthat is a lot of metal. So  Ben  it's been six days. You've been on so many trains.\nThat's true. A really long\nplane ride before that. And I guess we both want to know... How are you feeling? I mean... I don't know \nI'm feeling pretty good. I guess there's this one thing.\nWhat is it  Ben? I'm feeling pretty jet lagged! Woooaaaah!\nWaaaooh! Hope you enjoy\nplaying Hide+Seek...? If you are  I guess. And we'll see you\nin season 13! Woo! Man  we're making\na lot of seasons. Too many. Oh my god. Okay  bye! (smooches) This is... Here  you go stand... (indistinct cross-talk) Ah  that's actually not so bad. Come closer. Yeah  right there. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Thank you so much\nfor watching this entire season of Jet Lag Hide+Seek.\nWe really appreciate it. And we have something\nvery special to yap about. I would— I'd say so. We are really excited\nabout this. We've sort of— We've talked\nabout this throughout the season. But we have taken\nour hide-and-seek format  and we have adapted it\nso that it can be played theoretically anywhere in the world. Wherever you live \nyou can get our hide-and-seek game  and you can organize\na game with your friends  and you can play hide-and-seek. And Ben  tell them about\nall the stuff that is in the box. Ten minute bonus. That's true  but there's\nmore than just that. We don't have time to\ngo through all the cards. Okay  you get the deck.\nYou get some dice. You get a cool question sheet\nwhere you can see all the questions and you can record all the answers like you're doing\na little investigation. Got a big ol' rule book that goes through\nevery possible little detail. It is— There's a lot\nof stuff in there. We really can't emphasize\nhow much work we put into this. Yeah  and I feel like you might\nthink that we just  I don't know  put the Jet Lag game on\nsomething that other people— No  literally  we wrote and\nwe went into Google Docs  we wrote words \nand we edited those words. Whole long ruleset. And also we—\nAnd we put it in a rules thing. And we playtested it  and we—\nThis is truly home— homegrown  homemade.\nYes. And we have not\never done this before  despite a lot of people asking  because we didn't think\nwe had a good enough game ...until now. Yeah  this was the first game\nwhere we finally felt like it could be played anywhere. It was not super easy\nto make that possible  but I think that we did do it.\nIt comes in three versions. You can play the big-scale \ncountry-wide version  like the version that\nwe play on the show. You can play the\nmedium-scale version. That's what you would\nplay in a major city  like New York City or like Paris\nor in more of a regional area. And then we have a smaller version\nfor you to play in a smaller area. I think it will be fun.\nAnd here's what I'll say. I want to see videos\nof people playing. Oh  yeah  that'd be fun. Yeah  literally\nmake your own Jet Lag using the game and\nmake a whole video of it and I will totally watch it. And I'm really excited to see what this— what\nhide-and-seek looks like in all these different\nplaces all over the world. And I'm sure that you guys will be able to share\nwith each other  like  \"Here's what my map for\nPhiladelphia looks like\" or Paris  or...\nthe entirety of Europe. I'm sure that we'll see\nsome really cool stuff  and I'm just so excited. I feel— It feels\nlike a new chapter in the Jet Lag: The Game universe. Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah. Anyway  that's your\noff-season activity this time. It's in the Nebula store. I'm sure there's a link here.\nGo to this link. And  yeah  I would... I... Will you check it out?\nI really just think that we... We really tried hard to\nmake this something worth buying. Yeah. We put off selling a game\ndespite people asking us to for many years\nuntil we felt like we could do it in a way where it would be\nsomething really good that we could stand behind \nand I feel like we did that. And so I really—\nI hope that people check it out. We coulda shaken\nyou suckers down for cash a long time ago.\nYeah.  Yeah. But we didn't do it. Anyway  go check it out and thank you if you do.\nYeah  thank you. And thanks for watching\nthe season  too. I mean  that's a\nlong commitment in itself. Yeah  we'll see ya next time.\nBye!"

        "transcript": "We're in Ferrara  Italy.\n(bell ringing) We're gonna play a 72-hour\ngame of tag across Europe. But that bell means it's 6 am  and Adam's the Runner. So he's gotta go  go  go! Bye  Adam! Bye  Adam!\nBye! See you in a few hours! See you guys in Slovakia! Slovakia.\nDoubtful. Yeah  I don't think he's\ngonna make it to Slovakia. Well  okay \nwe have 45 minutes now. So maybe we should\ngo sit down and do some oppo research? Yeah  let's walk over that way and explain how this game works. Alright  so\nhere's what's going on. We're in the small town\nof Ferrara  Italy  because it's the\napproximate midpoint between these three locations. In this game  I'm trying to\nget here  to Lyon  France  Ben's trying to get here \nto Capri  Italy  and Adam  who just took off  is trying to get here \nto Bratislava  Slovakia. Right now  Adam's the Runner. While you're the Runner  you can make progress\ntowards your end location  and if you make it\nall the way there  you win the game immediately. But while you're the Runner  the other two players\nwill be the Chasers  who have a tracker\non you at all times and will work tirelessly to\nhunt you down and tag you. Once they do  positions rotate. One of the Chasers\nbecomes the Runner  and you become the Chaser. If no player reaches\ntheir end location in the next 72 hours  then the winner will be determined\nby whoever's end location is closest to the current Runner\nat the end of the game  which you can see in\nthese win areas here. Anyway  enough talk. As the first Runner  Adam's got a\n45-minute head start  so now he's gotta figure out\nhow he's gonna make it to Bratislava without getting caught. Step one... gotta get on a train\nout of Ferrara. There are really kinda\ntwo main routes that I could take to Slovakia  because I have to go\nthrough the Alps  so there's limited crossings. One is sort of directly north.\nIt goes through Innsbruck. And the other one is\nmore northeast. I like the northeast one because it moves me further away from both of their territories. To that end... I was looking at\nthe train schedules. And there's a train\nto Venice at 6:15. Which is a little bit tight  but... I think that I can make that. Ben  what's that? Pigeons. No  the building. Oh. It's a castle. (sighs) Where do you think\nhe's gonna go  Sam? Let's take a look at what\ntrains there are this morning and figure out what\nhe might be doing. Yeah  let's see if he's\ngetting on that  you know  non-stop Ferrari Italy\nSlovakia morning departure. Oh god  I really hope\nthat doesn't exist. There's a lot of options \nto be honest. And a bunch directly to Venice  which directly the\ndirection he wants to go. That's not good. There's a train at 6:43. That's a Venice one  yeah. I mean  there's also\na Venice one in eight minutes  and he's pretty close\nto the station. He is quite quick. Look at that. Made it to the train\nstation at 6:09. Not even close! Not even a problem. Venezia  track four. Alright. A—Andio a Venice  maybe? We're going to Venice. Oh  he's moving. He's going on the line\nto Venice. I mean  the good thing\nabout that  at least  Ben  is that the trains to Venice seem to be pretty high\nfrequency from here. Yeah  let's see when\nwe could take a train. Uh-huh. Alright  so right about now... they are probably realizing that the way the train\nschedules work out  the fastest they could\npossibly get to Venice is an hour after me  and probably is actually\nan hour ten minutes after me  unless they make\nthis really tight train. Which means that magically \nmy 45-minute lead has turned into an hour lead. And that's fun. It seems like\nwe might not be able to take a train until 7:43. Is that right? Oh  what? Hold on. Ah  yeah  that's not great. If that's really true \nthat'll give him a big head start. (hums faux-Italian music) (beatboxes to rhythm) (continues humming) Okay  so we are almost\nout of our freeze period. The next train towards Venice leaves in what  nine minutes? Yeah  and the station's\na 20-minute walk away. We'll see what we can do. Make sure your backpack's\nin sport mode. I can tell.\nI'm locked in. Three  two  one... Go  go.\nAlright  let's go. Adam  we're coming for you. Watch out for the cobbles. The cobbles are\nmy greatest weakness. (sighs) Alright. It's 6:45  which means\nthey are off. So let's hope that\nthey are running slowly. I don't know if we're\ngoing to make that train  Sam. Yeah. Alright  we've decided\nwith our good friends math and science\nand extrapolation that we are not making that train. We tried. But there is another train at 7:43 which only gets in\nten minutes later because it goes much faster. But still  it's a win for Adam. But  here's the thing. You need to pay attention\nto the coin balance. The coin balance \nespecially this early  arguably matters more. Yeah. Alright  so  here is the thing\nthat makes this game tricky. It's not as simple as me just getting on a bunch\nof trains to Bratislava. That would actually be\nrelatively easy. Because I'm the Runner  I have to pay for all of\nmy transit using coins. Okay  so \nhere's how this works. While you're the Runner \nyou have to pay for any form of transportation\nyou take  whether it's a train  a bus \na bike  or a plane  with coins. One minute of\nlow-speed rail is 10 coins  one minute of high-speed rail\nis 25 coins  and so on. Each player starts the game\nwith 2 000 coins  but that's not going\nto get you very far. So  if you want to earn\nmore coins  you have to pull a challenge card\nfrom the challenge deck. Complete it successfully \nand you'll get the reward. But if you fail or\nchoose to veto it  you'll be forced to go on foot\nfor the next 30 minutes. So this train is\nactually pretty long. It's 114 minutes  which means\nthat it costs 1 140 coins. Which means when I get to Venice \nI'm only going to have 860  which is... not a ton. So when I get to Venice \nI'm gonna need to do a challenge. At that point  I should be at least an hour ahead of them. So hopefully I should\nhave enough time. Egghh. We're at the train station. I wanted a little iced coffee. But in this country \nthat is illegal. If you put ice in coffee here \nthey'll kill you. Will they let me put ice\nin coffee in Austria? I guess I hope Adam doesn't\nget all the way to Austria. That would be pretty bad. Our train to Venice leaves in \nwhat  about 20 minutes. (sighs) This train is carrying\na bunch of circles. Well  they need\ncircles all over Europe. Right. Alright  Adam. Time's up. We're on our way. Okay. Welcome to Venice Mestre  which does not have canals. That's that way. Sorry about that. So as far as I can tell \nthe soonest they could get here is about an hour. It seems like the best move is to head towards Udine. There's a train there\nin 17 minutes. But I need more coins  so... it's time to pull\nthe first challenge. Alright  well  Sam  it looks like he's\ngotten off in Mestre. Which is very disappointing  because that means that Adam\nis miles away from Venice. It'll look nothing like Venice. Yeah. He's got\na little over an hour. So at this point  he's probably\nabout to pull a challenge. And we just have to hope\nthat it's a bad one. Guesstimate a kilometer. Starting from the place\nwhere you were when you pulled this card \nwithout measuring  get as close to one kilometer\naway as you can  measured as the crow flies. You must be right within 30%. If you fail  you may not reattempt. Apart from a timer/watch  you may not consult your phone \nmaps  or any other tools until completing or\nvetoing this challenge. Okay. Okay. Okay. Metric system.\nWhat is a kilometer? Theoretically  if I walk\nat 15-minute mile pace... it should take me nine minutes\nto walk a kilometer. It looks like we've got\na bit of a delay here. That seems to be\na particular feature of the Italian trains. Yeah. Look.\nThey said five minutes. Yeah  and they're\nalways 100% right when it comes to delays on\ntheir first guess  right? Yeah. Okay  so Adam's\nmicrophone got disconnected for a few minutes here \nbut basically  after walking in\nas straight of a line as he could for nine minutes  he stopped  declared his spot  went to measure\nhis distance  and  well... I'll let his reaction\nspeak for itself. Now with\n1 000 shiny new coins  he headed back to the station  hoping to make the train to Udine\nthat was leaving in 8 minutes. Sam  it looks like\nAdam is going back to the train station already. I mean  there is a train\nto Udine in four minutes. Which is exactly the direction\nhe wants to go  so... And how would he have\ngotten all those coins already? Yeah  especially\nbecause that train to Udine is a super...\nmakes all the stops. It takes two hours to get there. Ah  he might have\ngotten really lucky. That would be bad. Yeah. He's on the move. Towards where? Probably Udine  but we will see. Alright  Benjamin  we're\ngetting close to bad Venice. (sighs) Yeah. So  we were supposed\nto be there now  but the train's delayed.\nYeah. But there is a train\nthat leaves for Udine very soon after\nwe're gonna get in. Yeah. I think we can make it? And I think we should. Because it's a bit of\na choke point. Yeah  I mean he's  unless\nhe goes all the way back  he's gonna have to go\nthrough there to get into Austria. I think we're alright. I think we're doing\npretty good  Sam. Ben  we have a problem. Slight problem. Well  the train that\nwe want to take to Udine requires seat reservations \nand it's too close to departure to actually reserve\nthem online right now. We can try and book those\nseat reservations in person. We can try.\nWe just won't have long. No. If we miss that one \nthe next one's not until 10:08. That's not great. That is really not great. Literally the\nlast clip we filmed  I was like  \"I'm feeling good.\" That's why we don't do that.\nThat's why we don't do that. We never do that.\nWe never say that on this show. Let's get by the door. Oh  god. And we have\nno idea how to use these. No.\nLet's hope. Trenitalia ticket\nmachine speedrun. Okay. Udine. Continue. A mobile phone?\nOh my god. Print  print  print \nprint  print  print. Faster  print. Oh  please  god. We literally have 60 seconds.\nOkay  go  go  go  go. Oh  my god! Six!\nSam! Was it six? No  I think it's twelve. Twelve. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Don't tell me. Oh no. Oh no  Ben. Oh no. (train accelerates)\n(Ben and Sam pant exhaustedly) So  Ben and I missed\nthe train to Udine. And that's where things in\nthis game got a little messy. You see  on his way to Udine  Adam was getting so paranoid\nthat we had made that train and were gonna cut him off\ndown the line  that he decided\nto get off his train in a small town in\nthe middle of nowhere called Susegana. I'm really hoping\nthat around now  Ben and Sam are sort of\nsquinting at the map  going  \"Where is he? Susegana?\" Suse... Susegana.\nSusegana. So  Ben and I  seeing that\nAdam had gotten off his train  looked at our options\nto Susegana. As far as we could tell  our next train there\nwould actually get in before he could take a train out \nleading us to believe... Hooh. We might have him trapped. So  we booked\ntickets to Susegana  knowing he couldn't\nescape by train before we arrived. But Adam  it turned out  wasn't planning on taking\na train out of Susegana at all. He had cooked up a different idea. Hello  welcome to Susegana. You might be wondering  Adam  why are you\nin Susegana? And let me tell you. So the train schedules\nwere terrible for me. If I had gone all the way to Udine  they would have just\ncaught up to me and tagged me before\nI could do anything. So  the plan is to get on a bus... to a place called Conegliano... and hopefully fake them out. And then in Conegliano  I can get on a train\nto Gorizia... which is on the border\nwith Slovenia. And if I walk across that border  I can get on the\nSlovenian train network. And then I can start to\nhead up to Bratislava. I have some time here\nuntil the bus I want to get on. The bus leaves at 10:07. So  I figure I should\ndo a challenge. Technically \nI have enough coins to get to Gorisia \nbut just barely. And I really don't ever want to be\nat a super low coin balance. So I think now is the time\nto do a challenge. Alright. Play local spirit pong. Find any alcohol produced\nin your current country. Throw any item from\na distance of at least six feet. You have ten attempts. Okay  okay  okay  okay  okay. Oh man  I really hope\nSusegana has stores! Okay. Okay  okay. Bar alla Stazione. Ciao. Do you speak English? It's okay. One second. (Adam and waitress laugh) Aperol  yes. That's it. Alright  well  this worked out well. I've got a cup of Aperol. Aperol is made in Italy. And let's throw\na little gummy into it. I feel like I can do this. Let's see how I do. Alright  ten attempts. Terrible. Okay. Nope  I'm overshooting it. (sighs heavily) Awful. Okay. We gotta reset. Gotta reset here. I mean  look  if he\nracks up some coins  that's great for his next run. But at the very least \nwe can stop him now. Yeah. And he probably knows that. Yeah  which I don't like. No  I don't like—\nIt feels devious. Do you want to\ngo look at bad Venice? Let's go look at bad Venice. I think there are\ncanals and stuff. Well  don't overpromise. I'm gonna be honest  Ben. The vibes here are...\nnot quite Venice level. We're trying to— I'm Googling cool things\nthat we could show you. Are you having any success? Well  no  Google's just like  \"Well  you could go to Venice.\" Yeah. No. Let's get some food. Abort? Let's get some food. Let's try this. Terrible. This is not going well! Oh  that was close! Naaah! (grunts angrily) Okay  okay. That's not great. (sighs) Well  that's tough. Okay  I failed that challenge  which puts me in an\nautomatic veto period. Veto periods last 30 minutes. And during them  you can't take\nany form of transit  and you also can't\ndo any challenges. Failed at 9:34. So that means my veto\nwill end at 10:04. (sighs)\nThat is just enough time for me to still make\nmy bus  but... (sighs) Not ideal. Not ideal! Okay  well \nI'm looking at the map. It looks like Adam is\nstill stuck in Susegana. But meanwhile  we're stuck in the Snack Zone. We got some Italian\nexclusive McDonald's items. We're gonna be trying\nthe parmesan snack  which... They literally\njust will sell you a tiny  tiny brick of parmesan. This is awesome. That's it. I love cheese. Alright  that\nlooks like my guy. If we get on the bus  then\nthat's step one of the plan. There are many other steps... But this is one of them. Grazie. Alright  look. Step one of the plan \nwe're on the bus. Now all we have to do\nis get to Conegliano  and then somehow\nnot get caught for another 30 minutes. And then... get on our train. And that should be easy  right? I'm gonna get off a stop early. Just so that I'm a sitting duck for as little time as possible. I would say we're... we're for sure entering\nthe danger zone. There can be no doubt\nabout this. I'm almost certain\nthat they're here. I have to imagine... that they are here. Okay  interesting update. It looks like Adam has\nmade it to Conegliano. Ungh  okay  wait. Bit of a headache  but I still think we\nmight have him trapped. But it might mean we\nwant to get a different... tr–aawwwh. (sputters) Let's see. We just missed\na faster train to \"Coneglione\". Well  let's see what\nhis routes out of there are. 'Cause they're still... quite bad. I mean... We can go to\nTrieste pretty soon. Well  not that soon  but... Half an hour to go to Trieste. I mean  actually \nthat's his only route. Yeah. Because everything else\nis to Venice. Everything else\nis just backwards. Okay  so... (laughs) We do have a faster route\nto Trieste getting in... Ugh. I wish we didn't. Yeah  'cause now\nwe have to decide. Ugh  I hate decisions.\nOkay  so... Oh  and we only have\nfive minutes. Okay  okay.\nOkay  okay. Paraphrasing \nparaphrasing  paraphrasing. If we left right now  we would\nget to Trieste beforehand  even if he took that train. However... If we went to Conegliano now  and he went on that route \nanywhere on that route... as best I can tell... which is not great right now... our next version of\nthat same route... is not until two hours later. So we would not get\ninto Trieste until 3. That would be really bad. Yeah. If we went to Conegliano  and he did get on\nthat train to Trieste— He would be able\nto get out of there. We'd give him\ntwo hours in Trieste  which is a big station with\ncross-border opportunities. And then he'd be\nwell into Austria. I think we need\nto go to Trieste. Christ  okay. So  okay  we have\none minute to decide. Our train is about\nto arrive right here. I'm not feeling it. No? I think... I just don't see why he\nwould've gone to Conegliano if he was just planning\non staying there. I have dark visions of us getting on this train\nand getting stuck. Yes. Oh  man! This is the part of the game\nwhere you start to get so paranoid. You hear any sound  anything. (sighs)\nAnd it really seems like... ...it's them. And look  even if they\nare at the station  maybe I can sneak past them. You never know. It's possible. I mean  it would— Ben's done crazier stuff than that. So we're just tracking\nAdam's movements. He's not fully at\nthe station back. He seems to be heading back \nbut he's cutting it awfully close. Real close. I mean  if he doesn't make\nthis train to Trieste  he's stuck there until 1 pm. I'm a little more\nthan a five-minute run from the train station. I'm gonna hang out here until about five minutes\nbefore the train leaves  because maybe that'll bait them into coming up here\nto come after me. And then... I'll just run to the train. And maybe\nthey'll have come up here. And I can outrun them and\nget on the train  maybe. I believe he's gonna\nmake this train to Trieste. Yeah  I have to imagine. Because nothing else\nmakes sense for him. But he's only got\na couple of minutes  and he's not even\nat the station yet. (clock bell ringing) (sighs)\nI think we have to go for it. Alright  I'm gonna run. Just... 'cause maybe that'll make me... harder to catch. I don't see them. Now our biggest risk is\nthat they're on this train  which is extremely possible. I don't see them.\nI don't see them. I don't see anybody. Okay. I'm buying the ticket. Oh my god. I think we might have done it! So he must be\ntaking that train. Well then  we are going to\nbe taking this train to Trieste  basically parallel with him. Yeah  but on a different line. On a different line.\nBut then— So we have to\nget in front of him and then double back\nand cut him off. Yeah. We might both\nend up in Trieste  but if he ends up somewhere\nbefore Trieste  then... Yeah  I think it\nwould be weird for him to go all the way to Trieste. Yeah. And I'd be surprised\nif he had the budget. (in Italian) The regional train\ncoming from Bassano del Grappa Yeah. and headed to\nVenezia Santa Lucia Il treno... is here. is arriving on platform 11\nat 10:52. Let's go. Alright. We are finally on\na moving train again. Well  that feels good  I guess. We're on the train to Gorizia. I didn't totally expect to\nget on the train to Gorizia. I kind of thought they\nwere gonna get me. So obviously\nthe biggest risk now is that they are waiting for me\nlater on this line. They certainly would've had time to get ahead of me at this point. But I mean  look. This is good. There can be no doubt\nthat this is good. There can be no doubt at all that what's happening now\nis quite good. I'm just doing a little bit\nof research about if there's any faster route to somewhere that\nhe stops on the way  like Gorizia. Yeah  the one interesting\nthing about Gorizia is there's not\na train connection... across the border  but... You could walk that. Yeah. Into this Slovenian line. So  I do wonder\nif he's going to Gorizia. I would prefer\nhe did not do that. Ugh. I don't like that. I feel like anytime\nthere's a move that I'm like  \"Oh man  I really hope\nAdam doesn't do that\"... Adam does that. Alright. I did not really expect that we would get\nall the way here. So... We are in Gorizia. Which conveniently\nis a two-mile walk from the border with Slovenia  where there is a town\ncalled Nova Gorica. The plan is... we're gonna walk into Slovenia... where we can join the\nSlovenian train network. Now... there isn't a train\nfor a while  so... we're just gonna\nhave to hope that... they don't show up\nbefore it gets here. We also don't have\nenough coins for that train. So we are gonna need\nto do a challenge. And I figure \nmight as well pull it now  while we're walking. Alright  here we go. Get lucky on coin flips. Get a coin to land heads up\nseven times in a row. Get lucky on coin flips. Get a coin to land heads up\nseven times in a row. Alright. Let's flip heads\nseven times in a row. This side is heads. Heads  one. Two  alright. Three  whoa! Four  nope  okay. Alright  well— Welcome to Monfalcone. It looks a tiny bit\nlike he's gotten off. Okay. So he is— He's going for\nthe Slovenia border gambit. Or he's just\nchecking out Gorizia. Or he's just\nchecking out Gorizia. Either way  that means that\nwe're headed to Gorizia. Nope. Nope. Nope. This sucks. Nope. (coin drops)\n(bleep) Yeah  this is gonna\ntake a while. So our train... ugh  still not for a little while. Still not for 38 minutes. We're gonna go\ncheck out Monfalcone. Yeah  let's go see\nthe wonderful... town of Monfalcone. Okay. There's some good vibes so far. This looks like\nan industrious town. Oh  wow. That's a lot of industry. Mhm. And right over that way\nis Slovenia. Which I hope we don't\nget to see up close. It's actually in almost exactly\nthe opposite direction  but... Oh. There's a lizard  though. Slovenia's that way. No. No. One. Two  alright. Three  okay! Four! Alright. Once again  we have\nnot yet gotten to five. This would be five. This could be\na good milestone. Five! Five  okay. We can do this. Alright  I'm gonna\nstop walking so I can put\nall my focus into this. Alright  this would be six. Whoa  oh my god \nthat's six. Folks  we're at six. Alright. We got a 50-50 shot of\ncompleting this right here. (exhales) Come on. Vending machine on two. Oh  there's a vending machine? Yeah.\nWait  I wanna make a meme. It's— You— The meme is: \"Me\"  and then \"winning Jet Lag\". We're gonna label it. You mean getting\nvery  very close... but not quite there? No  no  you don't get it. Nope. Nope. Nope. No. This is just gonna be such an\nunbelievable nightmare to edit. Just  just horrendous to edit. That's the other\nterrible part of this  is that I'm doing this \nand it sucks  and I know that I'm gonna\nhave to edit this later. (softly) No. Oh my god. One. Two. Three. Four  alright. Five  okay. This is for six. We have six. That's six. Okay. Nobody panic. Nobody panic.\nWe're gonna set up a shot. Okay. Here we go. Come on. Okeh! It's better to give him hope and then crush it. Because truly  the name of\nthis game is not winning. It's just trying to... create emotional turmoil\nfor Adam Chase. Mhm  mhm. Yeah  I mean... Basically anything\nwe do does that. It's not that hard. One. Two. Nope! Alright  I'm really  really\nstarting to feel like I might need to give up. (sighs) Oh my god. Look  look around. Look around... at how pretty it is. And I'm... And I'm doing this. I've been looking\njust at a coin. (sighs heavily) Alright. Back to it. Nope. How's it looking  Sam? Getting pretty close\nto Slovenia  Ben. So  we did say that we really\ncan't let him leave Italy. But what we really meant by that was we really can't\nlet him leave more than a couple miles over\nthe border outside of Italy. He can have a little\nbit of Slovenia as a treat. Just a treat  yeah. Have fun with that  Adam.\nLet us know how Slovenia is. Or you'll be able to tell us soon \nbecause we'll be there. Yep. See you soon. Okay. No. No. No. No. One. One. One. Nope. One. No. No. No. No. No. No. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Come on. Six. Okay. I've decided that\nthis is make or break. We are at six. If this is heads  we win. If this is tails \nI am vetoing. This is the third time\nwe have gotten to six. Alright  yep. Veto. Veto it. You have got to be\nkidding me. He's going towards a river. Maybe he's realized\nthat he's trapped  and he's just going to throw\nhimself into the river. To have fun? Well  I don't know\nhow we're gonna get him. Where the (bleep) is he going? Here's what I don't like. We've reached\nthe part in the game where we're far enough\nfrom when I last saw them  that I just straight up\nhave no idea where they are. They could be\nhours away from me  or they could be legit\naround the corner. Okay  well  we've\nmade it to Gorizia  where Adam... currently is.\nWe're here  Adam. Now the question just is  how do we get to Adam all the way on the\nother side of town and tag him without\nhim getting away? Bus. Do you have him\non the tracker? Yeah.\nOkay. Nova Gorica is\nthe Slovenian town. Which means...\nwhen we cross this sign... I will finally be able to say... Dobrodošli v Sloveniji. That took much longer\nthan I hoped. But in the good news bucket  our veto period is almost up. So I'm going to head\na little more into town  in case it is a timed challenge. Just so I'm near\nmore shops and stuff. I mean  it literally looks like he's just walking\nas deep into Slovenia as he can now.\nYeah. Alright  veto period is up. Let's do a challenge. Build a spaghetti tower. Using only spaghetti\nand one other food  construct a freestanding tower that reaches at least\ntwo feet in height and stays at that height\nfor at least ten seconds. The majority of the tower's\nheight must be spaghetti. You must declare\nan attempt at completion. If you fail three times  you automatically veto\nthe challenge. That seems doable. Just gotta find a grocery store. Google Maps\ndoes not seem to have... amazing data about\nwhat's in Slovenia. But... it says there's a\ngrocery store over here. I mean  this looks like\na grocery store to me. They're gonna have\nspaghetti here. Let's get the thickest\nspaghetti we can. Yeah  spaghetti no. 7. Now we have to decide\nwhat other food we want to build our tower with. So I think the way to think\nof this is like... K'nex. You ever play with K'nex? The spaghetti is gonna be\nthe long  skinny pieces. And then we just\nkinda need something to attach all the joints. Like a cheese ball. Cheese ball would be good. It's very light. Do they have cheese balls? These are the types of questions\nI never thought I would ask myself. Do they have cheese balls\nin Slovenia? You know? Yeah. Okay  potato chips here. Oh  yeah  these'll work. These corn flips. (whispering)\nWhere are they? Seriously  where are they? Alright  Benjamin. We're on the hunt. So  he's still pretty far. So I don't think we need\nto worry too much yet. Yeah  I think\nwe're good for now. But I think we want\nto stay on this side  because he's on this side. So it'll restrict\nour sightline more. Yeah  keep the tracker on him. And just  I mean  oh boy. It's really a straight shot down. (laughs nervously) Here  get on—\nI don't think he could see us. I mean... ...now  but... He seems to be a little bit\ndipped back from the road... but it is truly about\nas straight as a— Are you showing that?\nYeah. It is about as straight\nas a road can be. You should zoom in\nif you're in line. Slightly problematic\nthat he could just... look down this way\nand see us. Mi scusi. Do you need any company? Sure  you want to\nhelp me build this tower? Here  you want to be on? Right here  right here? Anywhere  what's your name? My name is Teo. Teo  good to meet you. What's your name?\nDo you want to be on the show? Yeah  okay. Great  here. I think I have to do it  but you can hang out\nwith me if you want. Alright. So I have to build two feet.\nTwo feet. Okay  I'll be right back. Great.\nJust five minutes. You do whatever\nyou want to do. Yeah. Stay there for a minute. We do not want him to\nspot us before we spot him. That could turn this into a\nlong and unpleasant afternoon. Just  just go stealthy mode. It's all a mindset  Sam. (twang) Okay. That was... not very stealthy.\nThat was a little... Oh no  my shirt. I like this shirt. It's devastating.\nWait  is that him? I just saw a figure up ahead. Okay  just keep an eye\non the tracker. I don't see him. No  what does it\nlook like on the tracker? He's right up there \nbut I think he must be in... some sort of park or\nfront yard or something. I hope he's not in\nsomeone's front yard. Let's go up there\nbehind that truck. I think we can cut\nthrough here. Are you co-streamers\nwith the other guy? No. Yeah  yeah \nyou have his logo  yeah. Oh yeah. I saw him  I saw him.\nHe's down there. Oh yeah  he's that way.\nYeah  I know  I know  I heard. I talked to him a little bit. Oh yeah?\nHe was in the store screaming... \"I'm searching for cheese balls.\" Cheese balls  okay \nthat's good to know. (laughs) He's searching\nfor cheese balls. Yes  we are streamers. Adam was looking\nfor cheese balls. Why would he be looking\nfor cheese balls? Cheese balls. What challenge is\nthat a part of? This is two feet. Hey  you gotta go! What?\nI saw your friends. Really?\nYeah. Shoot.\nI saw the two guys. Ooh  (bleep) me. Okay  wait  wait  wait. Okay  this is my attempt. One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  ten. Okay. They were that way? Yeah  yeah. We can go\nto the train station. Okay  okay. Need to find a trash can.\nI got it. Trash can's... is that  yeah. Great. What time is it? Okay  he's moved. I think we can go— I think\nwe can go down that way. He's definitely down that way now. Yeah. I think he's\ngoing for the station. Maybe  but... we'd be able to catch up to him\nand get to the station. He's on this road  right? Look  they were\nright over here  on this crosswalk.\nThey were there? Yeah.\nOkay. I really  really  really hope that Slovenian guy doesn't... Doesn't tell him?\nYeah. We probably should've\ntold him not to tell him. Yeah. Yeah. Mmm. Because he was headed\nthat same way. Oh  he's for sure headed\nto the train station. Let's speed up. He's out of our sight line now. We're getting very close.\nWe gotta be careful. And the train station's\nright there  right? Yeah  mhm. 20 minutes. I have to hide somewhere. You can't really hide if they\nhave your location all the time. Well  yeah  but if I can\nget up or down... (sighs) I think we have to keep moving. Keep moving  'cause if\nwe stay here  they'll come. (chuckles) Ciao. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Good to meet you. Adam. (muttering in Slovenian) I don't know  do you\nwanna go across here? Yeah  anywhere weird. They aren't here  huh?\nYou don't see them? No. If this guy's messing with me \nhe's doing an amazing job. I mean  he really\nmight be (bleep)-ing with me. But I have no choice\nbut to trust him. For some weird reason \nhe switched directions. I mean  the tracker's\nnot that up to date. I think we want to let him\nget into the station. Yeah  'cause he—\nThen we have him trapped. Yeah. Yeah  like  if he\nwent on the platform  there's no chance. Because there's\none exit  presumably. I don't have any\ncigarettes  no  sorry. Look  they're\ncrossing over there. We could go over by that side. Yeah  yeah. Let's do that. Do you see him? ...No. Where is he on the tracker? On the tracker \nhe's opposite all of the... I think we gotta go through \n'cause we gotta get to the subway  which is past those people. I mean  the main thing now is just making sure\nhe doesn't get on that train. Right. Oh! There they are. I don't think they see me. Maybe they just won't notice me? He's there. You see him?\nYeah  I do. Here  let's move up. Okay  get to the crowd \nget to the crowd. Okay  I saw him just lie down. So I think he saw us. No  I think he went... No  he just laid down. He's lying down right now. But how did he\neven get to that side? That I don't know. But I can see him right now\nthrough the window. He's lying down. (whispering) Come on. Come on. Get on the train. You don't see me.\nWhere could I be? Oh  I must be getting\non the train. And then you get on the train. No  I think there's a subway. I literally see him. You do? Yeah  but he's below ground. No  I see him\nwith my eyes right now. I know  I know \nI know  but he's... He's not lying down. You see how there's that dip? Seems like the vibe is kinda \nyou just walk over there. You think we\nshould give that a shot? Yeah  but he's\ngonna start running as soon as we start\nwalking that way. Yeah  seemingly  seemingly... Let's give pressure.\nThis is the Slovenian way. Well  what do we do now? Not a lot of good options. Alright  they're heading\ntowards me. We've got one shot. End of the line  brother. Sounds like\nthe vibe is just like— Alright  go get him.\nGo get him  Sam. Sam  I really don't like\nthe fact that we're running. That's a tag. I've been training  Adam. What do you think\nof Nova Gorica  Ben? It's a good run!\nYeah! The Slovenian people\nhave been very nice to us. Well  the Slovenian people\nwere trying to trick you. Were they? Did the teen come up to you and point you the wrong way? No.\nNo. A teen didn't\npoint you the wrong way? Come up to us and say  \"Oh  I saw him in the store.\nHe was getting cheese balls.\" Yeah  that might've\nbeen my guy. But then my guy  he at least seemed like\nhe was trying to help me. Well  no. He walked me around\nand tried to help. At least he said\nhe was trying to help. He offered to stash me\nin his house. Which one?\nWow. (laughs) I don't know \nthe Slovenian teen. His name was  I think  Teo. What'd he look like? He had dark  sort of\nbuzz-cutted hair. Oh  I think I saw that guy\nfollowing us around. The dude's playing all sides. It's hard to say\nwhat he was doing. Alright.\nAlright  Sam. It's 2:50. So we will start\nchasing after you at 3:35. Alright. Good luck. Good bye. See you in Lyon! Wait  what was the way? This way. Okay. Well... Well  that's— I'm actually\nthrilled by that. Yeah  you got pretty deep\ninto your territory. I mean  I made it\nto Slovenia. And you got us to\na pretty sticky spot. I think that Sam is gonna\nhave some trouble getting far. Oh  I agree. I mean... What is his plan \ndo you reckon? This is not how I wanted\nto necessarily start my run  but I think I might have\nfound a really good move. I'm just not sure. I'm really just not sure. (sighs  grumbles) God dammit. Caption+ by JS*\nTranscription: Roger Maiz  Marco Settembre Ben! Yeah? Did you know that the\nnext episode of Jet Lag is available right now on Nebula? Nebula? I don't have Nebula. Well  great news!\nYou can sign up for it at nebula.tv/jetlag. And you can also \nin addition to watching the next episode one week early \nwhich is right now – you can watch the\nnext episode right now – you can also watch an entirely Nebula-exclusive\nshow that we made called The Getaway. Wow! It's a great name  and it has\nan even better premise. Because what we did is we took six creators \nwe gave them $10 000  put them on an old VW bus  and had them transported\nacross the American West. But among them is a Snitch  a saboteur who's trying to\nundermine the efforts of the group. Sounds a whole lot like\nyou've heard of The Traitors. Or The Mole.\nYeah  it's a lot like The Traitors. So we added a twist. What we did is\nwe told all six of them that they were the saboteur. What?\nYeah  it's true. That sounds really funny. We we tricked all of them\ninto thinking that they were each\nthe star of the show  when in fact it was all of them. Oh  I get it. It's like a commentary\non influencer culture. You know  it's a commentary\non influencer culture. Or capitalism.\nAnd capitalism. And also just a dang fun show\nthat we worked really hard on  that we really think\nthat you'll enjoy. Yeah.  Yeah.\nYeah.  Yeah. But  I don't know. A whole streaming site just\nfor one week early stuff? Sam  no. Sam  don't worry.\nAnd that  and no show. Sam  don't worry \nbecause... also  with your\nNebula subscription  you get access to our exclusive aftershow podcast \nThe Layover. Where we get into\nthe behind-the-scenes of every single episode. Every single one?\nWe talk about all the strategy. So if you want to get the best possible Jet Lag\nviewing experience  you gotta listen to\nThe Layover afterwards. And plus  with your\nNebula subscription  you also get access to\na giant catalog of content by other creators that\nyou know and love. Like RealLifeLore\nhas this great show I've heard of him.\ncalled Modern Conflicts. There was another episode\nthat just came out. There's so much good stuff\nto watch on Nebula. So why do you not have a Nebula\nsubscription  is my question. That's crazy. I mean... I think the real reason is I haven't been offered\na discount code. Oh my gosh \nwell I can fix that. Really? nebula.tv/jetlag! Whoa! What does that\ngive me  10%? 40% off  you guys! That's so many percents. And Sam  let me\ntell you something else that's gonna blow your mind. If you sign up for Nebula\nusing our code  then you help\nto support the show. Because we get a portion\nof your subscription fee for as long as you\nstay subscribed. That's a pretty good deal. It's not a bad deal  Sam. I should sign up. Yeah! At nebula.tv/jetlag \nI think is what you said  right? That is what I said.\nI said nebula.tv/jetlag. Or at the button\nthat's maybe on the screen. Oh my god! Bye."

        "transcript": "Welcome to episode two of this three-day game\nof tag across Europe. As a quick reminder \nin this game  each of us is trying to get to\na different location in Europe. Last episode \nAdam was the Runner and tried to get to\nBratislava  Slovakia. But we managed to catch him\njust over the Slovenian border. That means now it's my turn\n– I'm Sam  by the way – to try to get to my location\nof Lyon  France. I've got a 45-minute start before Ben and Adam can\nstart chasing after me. So I need to figure out a plan. We are so frickin' back. This is not how I wanted to\nnecessarily start my run  but I think I might have\nfound a really good move. I'm just not sure. I'm really just not sure. The Italian train station\nis that way. The Slovenian train station\nis this way. And if I'm going to\nthe Italian one  I really need to rush  but I... think I have\na really good move by going out of\nthe Slovenian one. What is his plan \ndo you reckon? I've got no idea.\nYou think he'll go north? He could.\nInto Mo— I mean  if— He could go up into Austria. If I were him  I would... maybe go north up into...\nfurther into Slovenia and then into Austria\nand then west. All I know is that his best bet is to get on the other side\nof the Alps. Yeah. I can get to Austria tonight. On a route that they cannot\neven come close to taking. Before the freeze period is over  there's a train to... Jesenice  I guess  and... That train... (groans) That train... Okay  come on  come on. What the (bleep)? Oh my god  these train\nschedules are so unreliable. It's having a lot of\ntrouble loading his location. He seems to be walking. But he's not going so fast. No  he's not in a hurry \nwhich is sort of surprising to me. You would think he\nshould be in a hurry. Is there a later train\nto Jesenice  or is there not? Th— There are— Different places are telling\nme different train schedules. (whimpers) Oh my god \nnow this third place tells me something\ncompletely different. What the (bleep)?\nWhat the (bleep)? (sighs  sputters) Okay  that's too risky.\nOkay  that's too risky. I need to get to\nthe Italian station. In terms of the\nother train station... What it— Let's take a look\nat its departure board. Well  I'm looking\nat the train schedule. Yeah. What does it say? And  so  there's a train in a half an hour to Udine. I think that he's just\ngonna kind of have to come back the way that we came. Well  that seems good. Yeah  and also it's like  he's not gonna\nbe able to do that... for a half an hour. Back to Italy. Back to Italy. Oh  I'm already in Italy. This is great. This is great. We're doing great.\nI did just waste five minutes rollicking in the\nopposite direction because I thought\nI had a great plan. But  that's fine. That is fine. We're doing totally fine. Everything is awesome. This is great. Definitely not stressed. Definitely not feeling\nthe pressure of  you know  prior seasons of Tag\nand (mutters) ...Okay! Doing great.\nDoing great. Doing great. Doing great. Would we be able to\nmake it to the train station before that train to Venice left? Well  so what time\nare we back in? 3:35. Yeah  I mean\nthe 3:43 to Venice. There's  it's at 3:43. 3:43  and we're—\nSo we're not gonna make that. So I think at that point \nwe have to go down to Trieste. Whoa  no. Oh  that doesn't seem good. No  it doesn't\nseem good for us. We're on the bus. The bus is on its break. This is the bus to\nthe train station. Research time. So he actually might not be\nin that bad of a position. So that would get him\nto Venice at 6. How fast could we get to Venice? We go down— We go down to Monfalcone.\nMonfalcone. That's what I was saying.\nYeah  yeah  yeah. Down to Monfalcone\nand then back up. Yeah  yeah  yeah. And then we're only\nan hour behind him. Could be better. It could be better. And the bus is late. And I think I'm going\nto miss my train. (silly grumbles) Oh... this is awesome. The train was delayed\nten minutes. We're good. Okay  so here's the thing. My train  at least theoretically  will get in at 3:52 to Udine. And the first train\nthat they can take will not get in 'til 5:22. So  theoretically  I will have\nturned my 45-minute gap into an hour-and-a-half gap  and then get a train out of there \nsomewhere west. But at least I will have confident challenge time\non the ground there  which is really important\nto generating budget. Ben  he's already on a train. Yep  Sam's off. We're about to be out of\nour freeze period  but that— I think that means that\nhe's on the train to Udine. Udine.\nOo-dee-neh. Udine  yeah. But I think he gets stuck\nin Udine for a little bit. This is not great though \nbecause our trains  it actually turned out that\nhis train was very well timed. Our trains are going to\nbe very poorly timed. We're going to have\nto end up waiting 45 minutes for our train. You know the way? I do. Okay. Let's go this way.\nAlright. Let's go this way. Freeze period over. Sam  we're coming for ya. We are in fact coming for you. Welcome to Udine. They might figure out\na good plan? So here's the deal. I think I found this route... that will get me to\nthis small town... that they cannot get to tonight with an hour and a half\nto spare. And the thing\nthat I like about that is that it's at the confluence\nof four different rail lines. So I think tomorrow morning  hopefully  I'll be able to\nchoose which direction I go. And juke them out. Hopefully. I don't know. I need to do more research  but I have to get on this train\ntowards Treviso now if I'm going to do this \nso I think I'm going to do that. And I can do\nmore research on there to make sure that\nthis is the right move. But for now  it's sounding good. We're back in Italy. Ben-via-nuta a Italia. Short little stint in Slovenia. But I had a great time there. I made friends. I have a feeling you won't\nbe seeing them again  Adam. No  probably not  but... they tried their best\nto help me  I think. Welcome back to\nGorizia Stazione. Yep  where\nwe have to figure out what train we're getting on. Probably the safest thing\nis to just follow him. Yeah. So  Ben... Where is he? We will know soon... if he gets on the train\ntowards Venice. So we could then make\nour fastest way to Venice. Which doesn't go through Udine. Yeah... yeah. I mean  if we were confident— Wait a minute. It shows—\nI don't have his location as of five minutes ago \nand that's when that train left. Oh.\nYep. Yeah  he left  okay. So that means that he is\ngoing down towards Venice. He could stop before Venice. Particularly \nhe could stop in Treviso. It seems to me that Venice... is not very risky\nbecause it— we could get to anywhere he might be going. Including Venice  which is\nprobably where he's going. Right. So that means... we go down to Monfalcone. And then we transfer\nto Vicenza. Beautifully pronounced. (Adam claps \"Let's Go\") Welcome back to Monfalcone. Welcome. I've never been\nto Monfalcone. Well  welcome for\nthe very first time. Did you guys\ngo to Monfalcone? We did.\nWe went to Monfalcone  and I saw a lizard. Whoa! That's awesome.\nPlay that footage. Wow. That was great footage\nof me seeing a lizard. Okay. Is it cool here? No.\nOkay. Great. Also  I made Sam eat a leaf. Play that footage of me\nmaking Sam eat a leaf. You made him eat a leaf? Ben  your shoe's un— Why did you kill that?\nSam... I'll give you 20 coins\nout of my budget to eat this leaf. (crunch) So now we are off... straight to Venice on\nthe high-speed line. We just gotta transfer here  and then we're going\nstraight there. It seems like Sam's still\non his way that direction. He is truckin' along. Every minute that he stays on this train\nthat he's on is good. So  now \nBen and Adam are getting on a high-speed train to Venice  seeing that I'm still\nheading in that direction. But unfortunately for them  I'm not going\nall the way to Venice. In fact  I just got off\nmy train here  in Treviso. That's because I'm getting\non a different train  the train to Vicenza  which I'm\ngoing to get off early again to board a train north\ntowards my strategic hub of Bassano del Grappa. Hopefully  all these random\ntransfers will throw them off  and until they can figure out\nwhere I'm actually going – not Venice  not Vicenza  but this small town\nall the way up here – they're going to be\nstuck on a train going in the wrong direction. (sighs) Okay. Several updates. So  it looks like Sam\ntransferred in... Treviso. Yes.\nOnto a train to Vicenza. Which...\nWhich is... I would say on its face  seems like a smart move. Smart move. He figured maybe\nwe're going to Venice. He's dodging us in Venice. The unfortunate thing is that the high-speed train\nthat we're on to Venice... continues on\nstraight to Vicenza. Yep. So we are now\ngoing to get to Vicenza at 7:30. He will get to Vincenza... I think it's 6:46  but... I think he's gonna have to do\nsome challenges in Vincenza  which means that\nwe're gonna get even. And I think he's gonna\nhave to get lucky with them too  in order to get\noutta there on time. And if there's one thing that Sam often struggles\nwith  it is luck. No  God hates Sam. Alright  well... Sam  we will see you\nin... Vicenza. (smooches) Unless he stops somewhere else. Alright  welcome to... Castelfranco something \nI don't really know. I'm just connecting here to my final destination\nfor today at least. So I do have about 20 minutes  which I think is just enough\nto justify a card pull. So... Let us shuffle. First challenge of\nthe season  let's go. Puzzle box! Amy's Puzzle Box. Complete Amy's puzzle box. Do not destroy Amy's puzzle box. Finally. Oh my god. Now that... is a great one. Because I can start it here  and if I don't complete it \nthat's fine. Here it is. The puzzle box. We've been carrying this around\nfor like multiple seasons. So here's the thing\nabout Amy's puzzle box. Historically  Amy's challenges\nhave never been the easiest. Okay  there's a bunch\nof QR codes here. The first one I went to  went to a website\nthat has stuff on it. The other one seemed to\njust go to Rick Astley's— Rick Astley's\nNever Gonna Give You Up. So yeah  okay \nthe other ones are Rickroll  so I actually nailed it\nthe first time. Okay  so this website \nthere's three tweets. There's one from me... one from Adam  one from Ben. And we have a\nthree-digit code here. What am I supposed to\ninterpret from these tweets? Maybe the time? 9:07. 4:29. And then Adam's time\nis 10:12  which we can't do because... this is only three digits. 708 is the number of\nviews on my tweet. I don't know! Ben  I have some news. Sam—\nIs it good news or bad news? I would call it bad news. Sam has stopped in... Castello di Godego. What? Sam has stopped in\nCastelfranco Veneto. Okay. My guess is  he probably\nwants to go... up towards Trento. Yeah  well we looked at\nthis option a little bit  and... you would go up from there... to Bassano del Grappa  and then up\nfrom there to Trento  and then up through\nthe Alps into Austria. So what's interesting is... from our perspective... the fastest way to Trento... is not that way. The fastest way to Trento... is through Verona...\nand then up. Do we think\nwe could beat him there? Well  we actually\ncouldn't continue on to Verona  because it would get in\nat 8 pm. It would get in at exactly 8 \nwhich we're not allowed to do. We could get close to Verona. No  because the\nstop before is Vicenza. Oh. Okay. So that's really frustrating. I'm gonna break open the emergency snack\nthat they gave us. There is a button for a hint \nbut if I use the hint  I only get half the value\nof this challenge  which would be... not cool. Okay  what the (bleep)\nelse could this mean? Okay. (sighs grittily) There's just so many\ndifferent numbers on here. I'm not good at puzzles \nto be honest. (sighs) I was trying to figure out if the number of days between\nthe different tweets is equal or something \nbut it doesn't seem to be. I think I've decided\nto be lame. I don't want to waste\ntoo much time on this. There are a lot of challenges\nthat can be done quickly. I'm going to take the hint. Oh my god! That's so (bleep)-ing\nobvious  oh! So the second one has... \"Who won\"  so one. The third one has two. Four. 'Four' an iced latte. Oh  of course \nof course  of course. I really should have gotten that. Oh god damn it  there's more? Well  there's a quarter in it. Okay  I need to go to my train. Alright  let's go to wherever\nthe (bleep) we're going next. I don't remember. Alright  last train of the day \nI think  pretty sure? 'Cause basically\nI'm trying to do it as I'm going further than as far as I can tell\nthey can get tonight. Part of why I like this town is\nit feels like where I would go if I'm trying to take the line that goes north of it\ninto the Alps to start to cross the Alps. I'm not  because unfortunately \nthe schedules don't work. There's not a train for a couple\nhours into the day tomorrow. I would definitely\nget caught by then. But it looks like it. Looks like he's on the move. I do know\nhe was talking big talk about getting through the Alps. And that is way worse for me. He's probably intimidated by me because he knows that\nI'm gonna win. Yeah. So I think they'll  you know  assume that they can\ncatch me there. Assume that I'll  you know \njust get stuck there. I think they would essentially\nfollow me specifically and expect to catch me there. But by juking them out \nI can force them to go there... get stuck there a little bit \nand go somewhere else. Hopefully. We'll see. We could follow him... to Bassano del Grappa. Well  in many ways  it's one of the sort of\nclassic tag dilemmas  which is like \ndo we take the risk of... going around and trying\nto get in front of him? Yeah. Or do we just\nchase right after him? I don't know. I really don't know. We need to decide in the next... 28 minutes. Because that's when\nwe have to decide whether we're getting\noff this train in Venice. If he can get to\nBassano del Grappa by 6:44... Yeah  he'll be making\nreally good time. Welcome to\nBassano del Grappa. And mamma mia \nit is gorgeous. Look at this  Alps! There is a train that goes\nthrough that valley... up north. I wish I could take it. Unfortunately... it leaves too late\ntomorrow morning. They'll catch me at least\nan hour and a half into the game day. He gets in at 6:44  right? How far up can he get? He could get on the 7:25. So the furthest he could get\nwould be Primolano  Ben? If you started at 6 am\nin Primolano... can you make an early train? Mmm  you can. Unfortunately  Ben \nyou can make an early train. To Trento. There's a train that just\nhappens to start in Primolano  that runs once a day that\ngoes straight to Trento  fast. Oh  they heard Sam was in town. That's insane \nthat that exists. Okay  things are\ngetting a little twisty. So let's take a minute to\nclarify what's going on. Right now  I'm in\nBassano del Grappa  where I plan to do challenges\nuntil the game day ends at 8 pm. From there \nthere's a train line north  into the Alps  but I\ndon't plan on taking it. Instead  my hope is\nto bait Ben and Adam into coming after me  which  thanks to some weird\ntrain schedules  would cause them to get stuck\nin a nearby town overnight  allowing me to juke them and take a train\nwest in the morning  stranding them behind me. Meanwhile  Ben and Adam\nare really worried I'm gonna head north \nand have just discovered an especially good route\nI could take north. I don't even know that\nthis route exists  but now they're\nso afraid of me taking it that instead of following me  they're considering\ngoing around me on a faster route to Trento\nto cut me off. So now  back to them \nas they decide what to do. We have to decide in the next three minutes\nwhat we're doing. (sighs) I think we have to... I think we have to go around. I think we don't have a choice. Yeah  we're going around. And it means he's gonna\nget up into the Alps. But I think we can catch\nhim there  at least. (sighs) I just think we\ndon't have a choice. We can't follow after him. I think we'll just\nlose too much time  especially in the morning. We'll end up almost\ntwo hours behind him if we try to follow him.\nYeah. For now  we gotta lock in ...and finish this challenge. Alright  this is the part\nthat I already completed back wherever the (bleep)\nI was  I don't remember. Oh  that's looking good. Oh  that's looking good. Ooh. (gasps) Yes  yes  yes  yes. And then... And then... Oh my god  don't let this... Is this a red herring piece? I think it's a red herring. I know  Amy  she would. Let's flip that. Hmm. It's concerning that these\nnumbers are sideways. Upon further analysis \nthe numbers are sideways because the puzzle is wrong. He is... playing pretty well. Given the hand he was dealt. This is our last chance.\nThis is Venice. I think we have to stay on. Yeah  we're going around  okay. It's not what I want. I just don't think we\nhave a choice  frankly. What the hell? Oh  great.\n(chuckles) Okay. Okay  let's try these ones and\nassume that's a red herring. No  that's not right. Okay  okay  okay. What else could be wrong? There's also this quarter. I have no idea why\nthere's a quarter. What if I take this number\nand quarter it? No. Of course not. I'm an idiot. I don't know\nwhy I'm an idiot yet. What does the quarter mean? It says bing-bong. Why does it say bing-bong? Bing-bong. Oh my god. (sighs heavily) It was bing-bong. You'll find your challenge\nwhere you find... What? Okay  so this is basically\ntranslating to \"pickled plum\". Which is a thing that\nScotty and I tried in Japan. But I don't know... how I'm supposed to\ncontinue the puzzle box. Because... The website doesn't\nhave anything more. Ummm... What's the status  Adam? Well  Ben  he doesn't\nseem to be getting on the train we thought\nhe would get on. No  it seems like he\nmight be ending the day... in Bassano del Grappa \nwhich is... not as far as we thought\nhe was gonna get. No  and if that is  in fact \nwhere he's ending the day... it means we have made\na mistake. Yeah  it means that we... we simply did not\nhave to go this hard. We may have gone\na little too hard. I mean  maybe\nthat train's delayed  but he's not even\nat the station though. God damn it  Sam. This is really bad. This is really bad. I can't even figure out\nhow I could progress. Because I've solved this. There's nowhere to...\ninput information. Fundamentally  I just don't— I just don't know\nhow to continue. 'Cause I've scanned\nall these QR codes. This string  I don't know\nwhat the string is about. I've solved the puzzle. The number doesn't\nseem to do anything. This doesn't do this.\nThis doesn't do that. I don't know where\nto input anything. I kind of feel like\nI might just have to veto. But then I barely have a\nviable next option at that point. Unless they've really\ncatastrophically messed up. I want to decide now so that my veto period doesn't\nlast until the morning at 7:29. (sighs) And it's 30 minutes. I think I have been stumped. So  with\nthree seconds to spare... I'm gonna veto. I just... I just don't know\nhow to continue. It's probably gonna be\nsomething stupid obvious. This is really bad. This is really bad. This is gonna dramatically\ninfluence my ability to even come close\nto winning this. (grumbles) Alright  well \nwelcome to Vicenza. Yeah  what can I say  really? We got scared.\nWe got scared. Okay  one second.\nI'm trying to see... if we can do\nany backtracking tonight. We could get to here. But that doesn't really—\nThat's the wrong way. (video call dial) Oh  hey. Hello. Well  I was gonna\nsay I'm sorry  but I'm mostly not. I'm sorry that\nbad luck has befallen you  but I'm very excited that\nthe puzzle box got used. Okay. Here's the solution. Did you put\nthe puzzle together? Yeah.\nThe jigsaw? Yeah. Okay  okay \nwhat did you... What did you get\nfrom that experience? Numbers. Okay. Have you noticed\nanything about... what you could do\nwith the numbers? Mmm. Let me see if\nI flip them over. Well  no  clearly \nbut  you know. (both laugh)\nWell  sure. No. What would you usually do if confronted with\na set of three numbers  then three numbers \nthen four numbers? Then four numbers? Yeah  there's\nten puzzle pieces. So it turned out\nthe 10th puzzle piece was... in my pocket. See  when I left\nCastelfranco mid-solve  I stuffed everything\ninto my pocket  and when I took out\nthe puzzle pieces in Bassano  I accidentally left one\nin my pocket. Whoops. Once I found\nthe 10th puzzle piece  Amy told me it was\na phone number  so I gave it a call  and it said: Welcome to the\nJet Lag: The Game Helpline. Proudly offering assistance\nto weary travelers since 2023. Please listen to\nour menu for options. To hear about my day \npress 1. To hear from a local \npress 2. To hear the puzzle box\nchallenge  press 3. I tried each of the options... I had a\npretty good day actually. Here's Evan\nfrom Switzerland. I'm sorry  there are\nno puzzle box challenges available at this time. And when that\ngot me nowhere  I called Real Amy again  and she told me that \nlike the website said  the phone menu is seasonal. So I'd have to enter\nthe Jet Lag season where I ate those plum things \nwhich was season six. So I called Robot Amy again \ndialed six  and got this. Yeah  you got me. There's always a puzzle box\nchallenge available. And here it is: Blow on the coin and say  \"I wish  I wish \nwith all my socks  to get coins from\nthe puzzle box.\" Then throw it into water. Once the coin lands in water  your wish is granted and\nthe challenge is complete. But I'd already vetoed \nso I didn't do any of that. That really  really \nreally  really sucks. Both for my prospects\nof winning  but also just... I feel quite bad because\nthat was all in my control. You know  it feels— It doesn't feel as bad\nwhen you fail because of a train delay\nor a cancellation or just good strategy\nby the other guys. That was just straight up\njust me failing that. Ugh. Just tiny things like that  literally that one puzzle\npiece in my pocket  might have cost me the game. (grumbles softly) At least Ben and Adam\nhaven't caught me yet. Got that going for me. Welcome... ...to Vicenza. Benvenuti a Vicenza! Yeah  a little bit of a curveball. Sam had basically... a god-tier route to Trento. Yeah. If he had just gone a little bit\ninto the Alps tonight  he would be able to get to Trento\nan hour earlier tomorrow morning. More than an hour earlier.\nAn hour twenty earlier. We honestly don't know\nwhy he didn't. Yeah  it's hard to say. In our opinion \nhe played himself. But either way  it means that if we\ncontinue on to Trento – which is our plan to cut him off – we'll now get there\nbefore he gets there. For sure before he gets there \nwhich could be good. Alternative option \nwe could backtrack and just go to where he is now \nBassano del Grappa. Because the first train\nto Trento from there is at 7:25  and we could get there at 7:20. And we would be able\nto get him  assuming... Assuming no delays.\n...no delays. Which does not seem like\na good thing to assume necessarily.\nI was on a delayed train today! Yeah  we were on quite a few. I'm gonna sleep on it. Yeah  we'll sleep on it.\nWe'll sleep on it. And we'll see you\nat 6 am tomorrow morning in this exact same spot. Good night! Alright. It's finally the rest period. I'm gonna lock in this\nas my end location. And... See you tomorrow. Hopefully that goes\nbetter than today. Now it's the end of day one  and time for the first\nrest period. Every day at 8 pm  players stop wherever they are \ngo to a hotel to sleep  and resume gameplay\nfrom that exact location at 6 am the next morning. And now  day two. Good morning. Good morning. Welcome back to Vicenza. So... we've had\nsome time to ruminate. Here is my take. Give me your take  Adam. I have... I think that I... Alright  it's 6 am. Oh man  we're back. Alright  obviously \nlast night didn't go amazing. But I'm back with a new strategy. Because here's the thing. All I need is to have\nthe spirit of a champion. That's right \nwith a can-do attitude and a little bit of gumption \nI can... I can achieve any— Okay  we're gonna\ngamble  basically. So far  it seems like\nabout one in three trains that we have experienced\nin Italy gets delayed. Yes. Which means... if we were to go\nto Bassano del Grappa... I would say there's about\na one in three chance that we are there... five minutes later than\nit's scheduled to get in. And then we miss Sam. I think it's too risky. I think we gotta go to Trento and try and\ncut him off in the Alps. Which also is a cool sentence. It's a fun sentence to say. I just think it's like  look... We could have a two-thirds\nchance of catching him at 7:20  or we could have seemingly\nabout a 100% chance of catching him at 9:30\nwhen he gets there. And I would rather\nthe 100% chance. Yeah. And when we say 100%\non Jet Lag  we mean 85.\nYeah. But that means we should go. Yeah. We increased the cost of the double-up\npowerup this time  where  you know  you get twice\nthe value of the challenge. But this time  instead of\n2x the veto penalty  we get 3x. And also just \nthe challenges are harder  as you saw last night. You can reasonably fail some. But  the thing is  I think I'm gonna get caught\npretty soon  regardless  if I don't get more budget \nbecause I'm pretty low. So I feel like I might as well. Bit of a Hail Mary  but... Let's buy the\ndouble-up powerup and pull another challenge. If this is good... ...we've got this. Okay  ready? (exhales stiffly) Is it good? (gasps) Chat... ...we are s-s-so back! Caption+ by JS*\nTranscription: Jacob Star It's clear\nthat it's very good. Pretty good.\nDo you want... Do you want to tell them\nwhat the card was? No  they have to go\nwatch the next episode. Where?\nNebula. What? Every episode is available\none week early on Nebula. That's awesome news! So you can either celebrate whatever just happened with me or get really frustrated because you're rooting\nfor my downfall. I know I am. That is... right. So anyway  you should go\nto Nebula and watch that. And  you know  once you're\ndone watching that... I think there's some other\nstuff you could check out. That's so true. There is other stuff\nthat you could check out. You could  for example \ncheck out The Getaway  which is an entire series\nthat we made that is exclusive to Nebula. Mhm.\nWhich is basically... a version of The Mole \nbut we made everybody the mole. I heard it's pretty good. And they all think that\nthey're the only one. And it sort of\ntakes place on a bus going through the American West \nand it's a lot of fun. And if you're done watching that... you could also\nlisten to The Layover  which is our\nNebula-exclusive podcast where we recap every\nepisode of Jet Lag  and we sort of give you some\nextra behind-the-scenes  and we give you  you know  extra strategy details that\ndidn't make it into the cut. And we just sort of joke around and have an\nall-around good time. But listen up  buckaroos.\nThat's not all. It's not just our stuff on Nebula. There is a massive catalog\nof great content from other creators\nthat you know and love. We got RealLifeLore on there. We got Real Engineering\non there. We got Jessie Gender on there  [who] just put out an amazing\nshort film called Identiteaze. We've got Abigail Thorn \nthe creator of Philosophy Tube  who just released a trailer\nfor an amazing new movie called Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend. And  you know  these are—\nThis is just another one of the many Nebula Originals\nthat we're able to make thanks to all the Nebula\nsubscribers' subscription fees. You know  we take these creators and help fund these\nbig dream projects  such as  you know  this really well-produced thing and three white boys running\naround Italy with iPhones. That's my dream. Or our show\nwhere we tricked people in the Midwe— in the West \nin the American West. That was my other dream.\nThat's true  that was  yeah. Yeah. Anyway  you should sign up. And I'll—I'll mention\na little secret. Whoa!\nnebula.tv/jetlag. Whoa! It's this very  very secret link. Whoa.\nWe keep it very under wraps. And because on there... you can get 40% off an\nannual subscription. Whoa.\nOh my gosh. We're going to lose\nso much money on that. You better not type that\ninto your browser. That would be so bad. I would be so annoyed if you\nput that in your browser. I would be so pissed if\nyou used our discount code. Man. Especially if\na ton of people did it. If so many people did it \nthat would be so bad for us. That would be really bad.\nWe'd be screwed. We'd have to make\nmore shows. Yeah.\nYeah. Ugh  okay.

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nto episode three of our game of tag across Europe. Right now \nI  Sam  am the Runner  and I'm trying to get\nto Lyon  France before Ben and Adam\ncan catch me. Last episode started tough for me. I lost a ton of time failing to\ncomplete a puzzle box challenge  leaving me low on coins\nand stuck overnight in the small town of\nBassano del Grappa. But then things\nstarted to turn around. Ben and Adam got so afraid\nof me taking a route north that they preemptively\nwent around me to cut me off in the Alps. And then  at the start of the day  I used a double-up powerup\non my challenge  and this happened. Okay  ready? (exhales stiffly) Cursed!\nYour phone is dead. For the rest of your run  you cannot use your phone\nfor navigation or research. You may use your phone\nif a challenge specifies its use (ie. to take a photo of something) or to communicate\nwith the Chasers. Is it good? (gasps) Chat... ...we are s-s-so back! Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. I might have just pulled the single best card\nI could pull. Because this is one of\nthe highest-value cards in the entire deck \nand I get... 4 000 coins. So here's the thing. This means... (sighs  blubbers) (in Italian) ...Centrale at 6:26\nis arriving at platform three. You okay?\nYeah. I think I got bit by one of\nthem Italian spiders last night. Okay  well  you gotta \nyou gotta reckon that— (in Italian) The train...\nOh my (bleep)-ing god. You gotta reckon that\nSam is feeling pretty nervous this morning. Yeah. We are so back. We are so  so back. Oh my god. That is  that is... Oh boy. Oh boy. He's gotta know that\nwe're right on top of him. Yeah  well  I mean  if we had taken the most\ndirect route to him  we would be over to him... you know  in 20 minutes.\nYeah. We obviously—\nWe didn't do that because we thought he was\ngonna get further last night. But  he should know that he's\nin pretty serious danger. I think I need to make\na really important decision... quite fast. And that is basically do I go for it\nthis run  or not? In the dying minutes\nof the veto last night  I did a little bit of research\nabout this morning. Assuming they position\nthemselves exactly right  Ben and Adam can get here... 6:44  6:45-ish\nis the first train in. I don't feel like... I don't feel like I can\nmake it all the way to Lyon  while evading them \nwithout... train schedules\non my phone and stuff. Because the ability to\nformulate a very specific plan and figure out  you know \ntrains and stuff is really crucial. I think my best chance\nof winning... and I really don't like this risk... is to earn some more coins... get caught here... and then get a— have a\nreally high coin balance and the ability to\nuse my phone again for my second run\nand be able to just go. But the thing is... It's not a when  it's an if. Because if Ben or Adam wins  I don't get a second run. And if any of them\njust take too long  and we don't have enough time \nI won't get a second run. But  it's just... I'm just not in a position\nto win right now. But I can put myself in a very good position\nto win later. If the stars align. Man. Okay. Okay. I think that's it.\nI think that's the strategy. So  we'll— I mean \nwe'll keep an eye on the tracker. But we're pretty sure we know\nwhere he's going and... Well  he only has\none way out of there now. Yeah. I just don't think\nhe has any options. I think  this is the whole point.\nYeah. He's— We will\nbe cutting him off. We will be establishing... a choke point in the Alps. Which  once again \nis a very cool sentence. So  I think considering I'm\nnot worried about getting caught  I think it just makes sense for me to do another\ndouble-up powerup. I think let's do it. Let's get another\ndouble-up powerup  potentially stranding me here\nfor 90 minutes. (inhales stiffly) Okay. Cursed! Data leak! For the next two hours \nyou must provide the Chasers with all the following information: purchased transport \npulled cards  outcome of challenges \ncoin balance. (squeaks) It's another curse! It's another curse!\nOh my— Things never go this way. The only downside is I do have to tell them\nmy coin balance. Ugh. Which I would prefer\nfor them not to know. Considering it's so spicy. His coin balance is 5 790?! Hold on  hold on. He just pulled\nthe data leak curse. We can see his coin balance. Which is... outrageously high.\nOh my god. I would like to see\nthe look on their faces when they hear that. And I will  because I get\nto watch this show. I don't— (wheezes)\nThat's crazy. That is crazy. He has\na crazy number of coins. Yeah. I don't... think...\nit's going to matter. I would say that\nthis makes me feel much better about our plan now. If he has that high of a balance  getting ahead of him\nis... imperative. Yeah. Well  this also makes\nme think that... the stakes of\ncatching him right now ...are so high.\nAre very high. Yeah. Because if we\ndon't catch him... He probably has enough\nto just go straight. My guess is that\nhe has looked at the fastest we could get there  which is that we would\nbe there basically now. And he did the double-up just to try to get coins\nbefore we caught him. And now he has a crazy balance \nand he just pulled this curse. And that is a valuable curse. And it got doubled.\nThat's my guess. Yeah  I think\nthat he probably thinks that he's about to lose  and he's just trying\nto farm coins. Yeah. But it'll be interesting to see\n– when he doesn't get caught – what he then decides to do. Surely he'll just go\nto Trento. Given the fact that I think\nthey'll be here so soon... I don't think I want to do a\ndouble-up powerup this time. So let's just do a\nplain old  vanilla card pull. You ready? Date an old thing. Find an old structure. You have one guess\nto accurately predict which century it was built in. You may not use your phone\nor any concrete information concerning its construction date. You must make this guess\nusing contextual clues. If your guess is wrong  you cannot find a reliable\ndate of construction  or if your building was constructed\nduring the 20th or 21st century  this challenge is\nautomatically vetoed. He's pulled date an old thing. He's still just pulling challenges. He's just... (scoffs) Hmm. Oh  date an old thing. Date an old thing. Okay  okay. This town  I looked it up\non the way here  is famous for this\nold wooden bridge. And I know it's that way. Let's get on the move. This is so handy.\nThere's a map. You just kinda go through there. Alright  here we go. It's gotta be that bridge. A good bridge. It's a very vibey bridge. I think Ben and Adam might have\njust pulled into the station  so I need to be quick. I think he still thinks\nhe's in trouble. Yeah. And I think  this is\nactually really interesting. I think he wants\nto get caught soon. Because I think he really\nwants a second run. That's my guess \nis that he's like  \"Please catch me  ASAP.\" Which is not what we're doing. Once he starts moving... we'll have one chance\nto catch him. Mhm. If he goes for the win\non this run. Because otherwise he's just— he's really gonna be able to go\nwithout stopping for quite a while. And so we just need\nto make sure that if he does go for\nthe win on this run... we'll be able to cut him off. (sighs) Oh  Sam. This is a good bridge. Oh man. This looks so Italian. The water's so blue. I love this. Okay  welcome to Verona. Two teams \nboth alike in dignity. In fair Verona \nwhere we lay our scene. Oh yeah! From ancient grudge\nbreak to new mutiny. Where civil blood makes\ncivil hands unclean. Okay  so  my initial guess... just based on how old \nold things often are in towns like this in Europe... So my initial guess would be... 16th  17th century kind of thing. But on the other hand... It is a wooden bridge. I do feel like the fact\nthat it's a wooden bridge does mean that\nit can't be that old. From ancient grudge\nbreak to new mutiny  where civil blood makes\ncivil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins\nof these two foes... a pair of lovers... Eh  I lost it. Say we're in a kind of\nRomeo and Juliet situation  in that... ...I wanna poison Sam. I don't think\nsomething in the 1700s would be... as\nhistorically significant. I think I'm gonna go... Yeah  let's try 16th century. So meaning the 1500s. The 16th century. Hmm. That \"hmm\" is me going\nto check my answer  an exception to my\nno-phone curse. And discovering that while the\noriginal bridge was built in 1569  which would make my guess right  it was completely destroyed and\nrebuilt three different times  most recently in 1948. Alright  does not count since I guess the entire thing\nhad been destroyed at one point. So  you know  the current version – while designed in the 1500s –\nwas not  you know... No part of it was\nbuilt in the 1500s. Yeah. I am confused why I\nhaven't been caught yet. I mean... it feels like if they were here... they should have\nbeen able to get from the station\nto here by now. Because it definitely was\nless than a 20 minute walk  and they've had 20 minutes. So  maybe they... psyched themselves\nout yesterday and went way further\nthan they needed to? I don't know. Yeah  so... We made the mistake\nof believing in Sam. We made what I believe\nwas a smart decision to go ahead of him\nso we could cut him off. The thing is \nyou can't cut someone off if they aren't trying\nto get anywhere. We are in front of him  right? We are blocking his path forward. The problem is \nif he doesn't move... we can't go after him. Because if we go after him  then he can just go to Trento and go around  and he\nwould beat us there. And then he would just be\nscootin' all the way to the end. That is to say \nhe has two paths to get to his win location. We're showing them\non the map right now. And right now  we're in a spot where we can block either. Yeah.\nSo this is quite safe. But if we go after him  then it'll open up\none of those two paths. And he can slip past us. Which means  unfortunately  I think  until he moves \nwe have to stay put. And I think that means that he can earn\nas many coins as he wants  and we just have to wait until\nhe starts to go for the win. So I'm currently\nhaving to decide whether I want to take\nthe train out of here north. Considering that \nfor everything I can tell  Ben and Adam are not here  and therefore maybe\nI can take that train  which would be awesome. So I need to get there fast if I want to take that. I think I'll make it in time. I'm almost— It's 7:15. I'm almost certain it was\na 7:20-something train. The question is... was it after 7:23 when\nmy veto period ends? And the other question is \ndo I even want to take it? Look  Sam. Eventually you have to move. Eventually you have to move. And actually  every minute\nthat you don't move  you decrease your odds\nof getting a second run  where you can use all of\nthose coins that you earned. But I have to imagine \nhe's gotta— he's gonna shift gears soon. He's gonna say  \"Okay  I've got enough coins. Let's just go for the victory.\" If Sam gets away  and we can't\nget in front of him again  with the amount of\ncoins he has now... He's just gonna go\nstraight to Lyon. So he's really dangerous. Which means that\nstaying in front of him is more important than ever. Where are they? What tomfoolery have\nthey been up to? And how are they\nnot here by now? They must have just massively\npsyched themselves up and thought I would\nget massively ahead... went massively ahead\nto try to cut me off  and are now not here  so... The train to Trento\nleaves in three minutes. I think I want to take it \nbecause here's the thing. Trento's not a big place. I think it would\ntake a while for them to catch up with me there. I don't know  because I\ncan't research  but... if it takes a while for\nthem to catch up with me... I will have safe challenge time\nwhere I can get more budget. It's now 7:23. I'm officially freed\nfrom veto period. Are we gonna do it? We're going to make it\nnorth of the Alps? I didn't think there was any shot. Yeah. I don't see a reason not to. Oh! Great news. It looked— It was\ndicey there for a minute. But it seems he has gotten\non the train to Trento. Yep  he's on his way to Trento. Which means that\nin 15 minutes  we can hop on a train to Trento\nand beat him there. And at least we have\nsomething to do now. Yeah! Let's do it. This morning I woke up thinking I was gonna get caught\nin about 15 minutes. And I really don't understand why Ben and Adam\ncould not get there within the first hour and\n25 minutes of the day. So my only thought is that\nthey must have been... really  really worried about how good of a run\nI was gonna have and  you know \ntry to go somewhere... in an anticipatory fashion. Like Verona or something \nyou know? How you feeling? Annoyed. I would say annoyed by how many coins he has. Just gotta make\nsure we catch him and that he doesn't go again. (wheezes) Yeah. Yup. I've been eating nothing\nbut those cereal bars. Yeah.\nFor the last two days. They're not bad. Ben  what do you\nthink about the Alps? Uh  I'm neutral. It's a Switzerland joke. Did that make sense? Is that a good joke?\nKind of. These are the Italian Alps \nbut sure. Look at this. Oh my god. Gawr-geous. And I bet it's gonna get prettier. Okay.\n(imitates swishing) Welcome to Trento. Benjamin  I'd like\nto welcome you to Trento. Sam should be here\nin a half an hour. We have to figure out where exactly\nhis train is getting in. Yeah  so we can probably\nfind an arrivals board. We'll have to sort of\narrange ourselves to make sure that\nwe can block all the exits from where he might get out. Yeah. 'Cause I do not like that\nSam is good at running now. No  that could be\na bit of a problem. My legs are completely\nshot from yesterday. I do not think that I could\nbeat Sam in a footrace. And though I could also\nnormally beat Sam in a footrace  my legs are also shot. Okay  here we go. Departures and arrivals. I think it's  yeah \nit's the one from Bassano. And platform one. Great. So  looks like he'll get in\non platform one. So if he does  in fact \nget in on this platform  which seems to be right... Yeah  he's trapped. I don't... I don't see how\nhe could... get out of it. Our guy is trapped. I think we just post up here and wait for his arrival. Maybe it just works out.\nMaybe this is it. Maybe I can... string together train routes in a region that\nI've never been to before. I mean  from Trento  I'm pretty sure I need to\ngo to Innsbruck  Austria. I at least just need to go north. And then I need to\ncross into Switzerland. Crossing Switzerland \nI think I could do. Because I've traveled\nSwitzerland a lot. I mean  we were just there\nwith hide and seek recently. I mean  I could\ndefinitely get to Lyon once I get to Zürich. Because from Zürich \nyou get to Geneva. And from Geneva \nit's just a quick train. I mean  hopefully there's\na map in the station. Yeah  I don't know. Hello! Hello. We put the camera\non a tall pole. Yep  we're doing some\nawesome stuff over here. So  we believe that Sam's train which should be here fairly soon... Yeah  20 minutes? ...will get in right here \non this platform. And then... (whap) We got him. And then... So... I'm feeling ready. I mean  look \nif I were Sam  I think... I don't know.\nI don't know what I'd do. I'd say \n\"Oh no  I'm screwed \"because Ben and Adam are\nso talented at Jet Lag: The Game that I simply cannot win.\" Yeah  he has\nso many coins  Ben. I hate how many coins he has. Well  it's not a problem because he's not going\nto get a second run because I'm going to win. Sure  yes  you've\nsaid this several times. So  we keep forgetting that.\nYeah. Bellissimo. So  I think that if we just... hide behind that pillar. Oh  and there's\neven a little... They put a little bench here for in case you're trying\nto trap your friend who is coming from\nsouthern Italy. He can't exit that way.\nHe has to go this way. We've posted up Adam here. I'll hide right behind there. I don't think he'll\nhave any way out. No. It's a perfect plan. That's his train. (whispers) Signal me.\nWhat? Signal me when he walks out. That train was scenic. Hello. Gotcha! Buongiorno. Buongiorno. Okay  I need the cards. I do need the cards quickly. Okay.\nI hate to be a rush  but... to quote the great\nSam Denby  please give me the cards. Now?\nYes  thank you. Okay  okay.\nGood bye. Good bye. Here we go! Alright  well  he wanted\nthe cards very quickly  and I think I know why \nwhich is that— —there is a train to Verona leaving very soon. I looked... sneakily... while we were\nwaiting for Sam. And I saw that it was\non platform two. Okay  Verona. The good thing about\nthis train to Verona is... I don't think they can get\nto Verona for quite a while. I'm going to do some\nquick little research. Okay. This says... that they cannot get on\na train to Verona until 12:33. That gives me\nseveral hours to work with  and I could really\nmake some bank. Oh boy  this... This might be\na really good start. Okay  I believe... This is my train— wait. Oh my god! It was delayed. Oh my god. Oh god  the train...\nleft without me. It said it was delayed\nfor five minutes  but then it left on time \nand I didn't even look. Okay. Okay. That's fine. We simply won't go\non that train. We'll go to a different place. (bleep) You got his location? Um... Sam  confusing news. Yes  so you were\nexplaining to me when he got caught that\nthe reason he was running is because there was about\nto be a train to Verona. Yeah  so I\nhad checked on this. There was a train at... (phone drops)\nWhoop! There was a train\nat 9:37 to Verona. Really well timed. And we wouldn't have been\nable to get to Verona until two hours later. So it seemed like a total \nobvious win for him. And I assumed that was why\nhe wanted the cards so much. But I think he is... still in the station. Which does— would\nnot make any sense. It was the perfect train. It was the perfect train. It was the perfect train. And I thought it was\ndelayed by five minutes  because it said\ndelayed by five minutes. And then it left. (tsk) (microphone grinding) (mouth peels open) (faint mouth pop) Ugh. So... I don't— I'm very confused. Did his tracker update? Oh  he's still here. It doesn't show him on— Okay  theoretically  this could be really \nreally good for us. But last time we thought something really—\nBen was doing something that was really \nreally good for us... I've learned now... that when Ben is doing\nsomething really weird  it's usually not good for us. On the bright side... they are not\ngonna know what... ...I was thinking. That might freak 'em out\na little bit. 'Cause it's like  oh my god \nwhat is Ben doing? Is this all part of Ben's... plan? Ben was really confident. He insisted. He had this very specific\nstrategy this season. He wrote down on\na piece of paper his strategy. I did not know this.\nHe wouldn't let me show it. I figured out a strategy... And what is that? ...that'll win me\nthe game guaranteed. You know what  in fact \nI'm gonna do something cool. I'm gonna write it down \nI'm gonna show it to the camera  and then you can play this clip\nwhen I definitely win. You can't look at this. This is my strategy\nto win the game that Sam can't see\nbecause it's so powerful. And it's definitely\ngoing to win me the game. He has some very specific ideas\nabout how to win this. And I feel like this could... ...play a part in... that? What is he doing? It's mind games. Why would he take— Why would he not take\nthe perfect train? It's because... Now I need to figure out\na new plan. Okay  we're not too long\nto the end of our jail period. So how about let's go back to— Yeah  we should go back there. We need to figure out\nwhat he's doing. Okay. I think my best bet now is... just hop on the train\nto Bassano... ...at 10:05. (huffs) The tracker shows him\nlive in the station. Is that him? Okay. Good bye! (sighs) Oh  man. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus So  was... Yeah  so he's getting on\na much worse train. Ben  why are you getting\non a worse train? Why didn't you get\non the good train? Doesn't seem to make\nmuch sense. I don't wanna do\nthis one. But we need an answer\nfor the show. I don't wanna talk\nabout it. But why did you take— I don't wanna talk\nabout it. How can the audience sort of learn more about\nwhat's going to happen now? (sighs) Look..\nIf the audience wanted to watch the next episode\nand see what happens  they could go do that right now if they signed up for Nebula. I guess that\nwould provide some... Yeah  that would help. But is there a different way that they could sort of\nhear you talk more about (bleep)-ing this up\nreally bad and kind of we could\nsort of make fun of you for it and stuff?\nYeah  there is  there is. There is  in fact. They could sign up for Nebula\nand go listen to our exclusive aftershow podcast \nThe Layover  where we get into\nthe behind the scenes and all the strategy of\nthe games and everything. Yeah  the strategy. It's the best way to get\nthe Jet Lag experience. That sounds good. Seems like a good idea. I'm sure he has a lot\nof strategy to explain. Yeah  no  I'd love\nto hear the strategy behind why you did that  Ben. Yeah.\nYeah. Nope. Oh  he seems... Yeah  okay. Well  let's... Yeah  so  you know  another thing you\ncould watch on Nebula is The Getaway. The Getaway is a whole\nseries that we made that is only on Nebula. We worked really hard on it  and basically the premise is that we made \nlike  The Traitors  but we made\neverybody the traitor  but they all think that\nthey're the only one. Yeah  it's pretty funny. It's sort of a\npretty fun thing to do. And you know \nwe're really proud of it  and... It's actually shot on\nreal cameras  not iPhones. It looks good and stuff. Yeah  we had... We had a whole crew.\nWe had gaffers Yeah  we had—\nand light people. You know what a gaffer does?\nYou know what a key grip does? We do now  because we\nhad those on the set. I totally knew ahead of time.\nI knew everything. Yeah  I know. You totally knew\nwhat a key grip did. No  yeah. Yeah  what about\na best boy grip? Oh yeah  I am an expert. Helps the key grip!\nAnyway! The reason why\nwe have that on Nebula is because Nebula\nmakes this whole series and catalog of original content  exclusive things called\nNebula Originals. And it's done this with\nall sorts of creators that you probably already\nwatch or have heard of. If you go to\nnebula.tv/jetlag  you'll get 40% off an\nannual subscription. That's a pretty good deal \nisn't it  Ben? Yeah. That's a great deal! What do you want me to say?! It's a great deal for\nthat amount of content? It's unprecedented! It's—It's unprecedented. Okay. Okay  what do\nyou want me to say? No  that's good. No  that's a\nreally good point. Yeah. Ben  would it\nmake you feel better if they signed up  do you think? Yeah  I don't know. It'd be pretty cool\nif they signed up  I think. It'd be good.\nWhy would it— Because we get money  right?\nFrom their subscriptions? Yeah  we would. If they used our code  then we would get\na cut of their money. Yeah. We could make the show\nmore and better. Yeah  use it to make\nthe show and stuff. Yeah we could give him\nanother shot at... Yeah  you know.\nWe can  yeah. We can make another season\nwhere you can do a better job. No  he did great. Yeah. Yeah.\nHe did great. It might not have\nbeen manifested in  yeah  but he did great. So yeah  go to\nnebula.tv/jetlag to sign up. And thanks in advance. And thanks in advance\nfor your support. Yeah. Do you want to say\nanything  Ben? No. Oh  okay.\nI think we're done."

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nto episode four of this three-day game\nof tag across Europe. Last episode \nBen and Adam caught me in the mountain town of Trento\nas I was trying to get to my final location of Lyon  France. Now  it's Ben's turn\nto be the Runner  as he attempts to get to his\nend location of Capri  Italy or to at least stay\nin his win region until the game ends. There was a fantastic train\nstraight to Verona that Ben was planning to take  which would have given\nhim a huge head start. Ben was standing right\nin front of that train  but he missed it  because he\nwas fiddling with his backpack  and then it left. So now Ben is headed\non a much worse train to Bassano del Grappa  leaving me and Adam \nwell... pretty confused. So he's going\nto Bassano  which is... Where I just was. Where you just were. But there's another train\nin an hour. Yeah  we can get there\nin an hour. And he could've...\ngotten on the other train. He could've gotten\non a cheaper train... to get to Verona... and have been\ntwo hours ahead of us. Okay. That was not the finest start to a run that I've ever had. (sighs) A lot of my plan hinged\non going to Verona. So... Now I've gotta come up\nwith a new plan that... originates in\nBassano del Grappa. I don't know what\nthat's going to be. But we'll figure it out\nas we go. And in the meantime... I hope that Sam and Adam\nare confused. That does not make any sense. I have to imagine... and I really don't... I really hesitate\nto say this because... You've been wrong in the past. I feel like wrong in the past  and we look like idiots\nwhen we say this  but... I believe something must\nhave gone a little bit wrong for Benjamin Doyle\nin the last 30 minutes. Alright. It is 10:17. Our veto period has ended. So... we know what\nwe're doing  right? We're just taking the exact thing\nYeah  just take the... that he took  but in an hour. Yeah  what is it  at 11:05? Yeah  I think\nit's exactly at 11:05. Yeah. ...Just go explore?\nI propose a little lookabout. Yeah  that would be nice. Go take a looksies.\nI mean  we're in a very scenic area. This is nice. Yep. Okay  so  good news. I've figured out a plan. So... I'm going to acquire... a boat somehow. And then we're gonna\ntake it to the ocean. And then we're\ngonna take the boat out into the ocean... where Sam and Adam\ncan't get me. And then I will win. Now  this plan will not work if I am not in my win area. So  that's kind of step one. And I think my best route\ninto my win area right now is... ...Bologna. So... I have a series of connections that should keep me\none hour ahead at all times as far as I can tell... all the way to Bologna. But I will have to make\nmore money during those connections. So my plan is to get\nto Bassano  go from there to\nCastelfranco pretty quick. Then I should have\nsome time there to do challenges. Then go from\nCastelfranco to Padua  do more challenges  go from Padua\non the high-speed  straight to Bologna. I'll need to earn... quite a bit in order\nto make that work. But if I can... I should be able to stay ahead. So it's all going to come down\nto the challenges I pull... (sighs)\nwhen I have a second. Look  Sam  it's Ben! That really looks like Ben. Aw  it's gone.\nNot anymore. Ooh  look  there's a big statue! Those are always nice. You wanna go\nsee the big statue? No. I think it's molto bene  Sam. What is? This! Okay.\nThe street. Oh  that's a good piazza. Whoa! This looks like\nthe one at EPCOT. I can't believe\nI missed that train. That's gotta be\none of the all-time Ls. It went straight to Verona. Real quick. (vocal fry) (gargles mic) The fact of the matter is  if I can pull good challenges\nin Castelfranco and Padua... I will be able to\nmake it pretty far. And I don't think they will be able\nto catch up with me unless they really\nanticipate my next move. They might be able\nto get ahead of me if they... are willing\nto cede that... like  to cede\na bunch of ground and go straight to... Padua or something  but... We'll see. So... Counterintuitively  it looks\nlike it might make sense for us to wait around more. Because... if we wait around\nfor that next train south to Verona \nwhich is in an hour  rather than getting\non the direct train  just the one that Ben took\nan hour later in just a few minutes... we can seemingly get\nsouth of him. We can physically cut him off. And there are these choke points. Yeah.\nPadua and Verona. He cannot get further south without going via\none of the two of them. Yeah.\nAnd if we wait  and then transfer onto\na high-speed train— Yeah  because\nthere's a high speed train that goes all the way...\nYeah. Milan through to Venice \nand it stops in Verona and Padua. So we can get\nto Verona or Padua either before or at least\nvery shortly after he could. And that's assuming\nhe hasn't slowed down a lot to do challenges. Which I think\nhe very well might. So  I feel like\nit might make sense to wait around for another hour? Yeah. Okay. I'll do it. I'll wait. Okay  hello. Welcome to Bassano del Grappa. There is a train in two minutes to Castelfranco Veneto \nwhich is right here. So we're just gonna make\na quick transfer... and keep on going. Then we'll have a little bit\nof time in Castelfranco... before our next train \nwhich is to Padua. That means we can\npull a challenge. If we can get to Padua... with 1 600 coins... then we can get\nall the way to Bologna. Now  the problem is  they could technically\nget to Padua... before me  if they went... had gone all the way\naround to Verona. And I kinda doubt they did that. Sam  what's happening? Well  timing is very important\nfor this  because... because we have a four-minute\nconnection in Verona. Uh-huh. But... But where's the train  Sam? It's not here  and it's\n20 seconds to 12:04. Which I don't love. And it doesn't show it as delayed  but even a couple minutes\nof delay could kill us. Which was really the one big\ndownside about this plan  is how tight that connection was. And you know where\nthis train came from? Where? Germany. It's getting awfully rainy. I'd feel bad for Ben  if he... if he's gonna have to do\nchallenges and stuff in this. Okay... welcome to\nCastelfranco Veneto. It is raining quite a bit. Okay  we are here\nin Castelfranco. Team Ben  do not despair. I am about to recover this run. All we have to do is\npull a good challenge. We have about 40 minutes\nbefore the train to Padua. So  I've got a little while\nto do challenges  I think  safely. Anyway  here is our challenge. Shop like a local. Go to any cafe (or any\ncounter service establishment) and order something. At no point can the server\nspeak to you in English. If they speak to you in English  you automatically veto\nthis challenge. (sighs) This one is quick. But I feel like I'm looking\nparticularly American. So  I've gotta sort of... ...absorb... I've gotta embody...\nmy most European self. You know. Hit him with one of these. But it is now officially 12:04. No train. The train is\nsupposed to leave at 12:04. Yes. It's not even here. Yes. Well...! (sighs) And the other key is probably\na really simple order. Un caffè. Something with no... Something where they're not\ngonna ask any questions... and just ring me up. Okay  here's my thinking. If I am able to just... hand them something \nand then pay for it... they probably won't need to speak. If I point at something \nor I order something  they might ask\nfollow-up questions  like  \"What kind?\"\n\"Whatever  that one.\" (sighs) So  I'm gonna see\nif I can find a cafe that I can pick something up\nand hand it to them. (softly) I have to order\nsomething very European. So that they'll think\nI'm European. Maybe some... bruschetti. And then I'll hit them\nwith a... 1 e 50  grazie. Pervà.\nMhm. (pay terminal beeps) Grazie.\nGrazie. Oh my god.\nOkay  challenge complete. Challenge complete. They did not speak\na word of English to me. And in fact  they spoke\nquite a bit of Italian to me  which was scaring\nthe (bleep) out of me. That's earned me a cool 800. Nice  okay. I'm really hungry. Oh-kay. Okay. Boom. Challenge complete. My train's at 1:25. Which means I still safely have time\nto do and veto a challenge. So  let's pull another one. This is good work so far. We're earnin'.\nWe're earnin'. We're movin'. Team Ben... I got you. I got you. Oh  I don't got this camera. This is gonna be\na (bleep)-ing breeze. Pickle! Quick-pickle any vegetable\nusing vinegar  salt  and water. Your vegetable must be split\ninto at least five pieces. You must put your pickles\non any food you eat today. Pickle. (huffs) Okay. I can do that. We need to find a grocery store. We need vinegar  salt... and a vegetable. And I guess something\nto pickle it in. If I get this \nthen I think I'll have enough to make it to Bologna. Sam  what time is it? 1:04. What time was\nour train to Venice? One. Yeah. That math does not work out. No. No  yeah \nyou're right  yeah. Yeah. Mmm. So  are the whole thing of that we were going to\ngain this half hour by doing this... Not anymore! We're going to\nblame this one on our good friends\nDeutsche Bahn. Because this train\nstarted in Germany. And is therefore a collab\nbetween Deutsche Bahn and— Whoa  that's hilarious\nthat we managed to get on a Deutsche Bahn\ntrain in Italy. Alright  so we've\nmissed our connection. We'll take the 1:30 to Venice. But it's too late to book\na seat reservation on it  so we have to go to the desk. Found a market. Mm-kay. Let's see. Vinegar. No vinegar  okay. Let's find another grocery store. There's one this way. Alright  let's go. Let's go. This should be easy. And if I don't manage to\nfigure this out in time  I'm gonna head back. I think it's more important that I take this next train\nand get to Padua. Because I'll have time there... before the train to Bologna. Pickle. Pickle  pickle  pickle \npickle  pickle. Pickle  pickle \npickle  pickle  pickle. Pickle  pickle \npickle  pickle  pickle. Really not moving here. 60 minutes delayed. Ah! Does that mean—\nThe 1:30. We're running low on time. I gotta get that vinegar! I'm thirsting for that vinegar! Aceto lì.\nAceto. Ciao.\nGrazie. Okay. I got aceto  vinegar. And I bought a carrot. So all I don't have is salt. But  it doesn't say there can't be\nother things in my quick pickle. And... these bruschetti\ndefinitely have salt in them. So  you know  I can just\nsort of grind them up  put them in there. Give it a little extra flavor. But first  let's get\nback to the station. Because I do not want\nto miss that train. The 1:30 is\n60 minutes delayed? Yeah. Okay. Does that mean\nwe should go to Bologna? Well  just  just  just\nhold on for a second. Okay  then we shouldn't...\nwe shouldn't get on it. We can just get on a train\nstraight to... Padova. Let's just do that then.\nOkay. I mean  it's\na slower train  but... But it's  I mean  it's\nbetter than an hour long delay. Or we could go down to Bologna. I mean  we could try to\ncut him off in Bologna. It says it's not delayed.\nLet's just get there for now and then discuss. I mean  there is a train\nin 11 minutes to Bologna. I'm just saying... I think he's gonna leave\nCastelfranco Veneto in nine minutes... Yeah  I mean—\nHead to Padua and then he'll make\nhis way down to Bologna. If we get in front of him \nwe could backtrack even. To like  back to Ferrara?\nYeah  to Ferrara! Or wherever. Yeah  I mean... Well  he's back at the station\nin Castelfranco  so... Okay  train's here\nin ten minutes. Just enough time for\na quick pickle. Got my aceto.\nGot my carrot. (chomp) Yeah. (chomp chomp) Get in. (chomp chomp) (chomp) Ugh! Oh. (chomp) Oh  it's burning\nmy spider bites. Okay. Carrot in. Now for a little bit of...\na little bit of salt. (chomp chomp) Train's almost here. Give them a shake. Those are some authentic pickles. (gags) (retches) Okay  let's go. Bleugh. Train's almost here. He's headed to Padua. The question is just— If he's gonna get\nto Padua before us... I don't... I mean  and he's\ngonna get to Padua... significantly before us. Yeah  then I think we get\non that train to Bologna. Yeah  I think we need to get\non the train to Bologna to get in front of him. At least to reliably\nget in front of him. Okay  let's go to Bologna. Yeah. Ugh  not ideal. No. Ugh. He's on his way to Padova. Yeah. So we're off to Padua. The good news is\nwe earned enough... back in Castelfranco... due to our skills... that we're... we have\nenough to transfer right onto a train to Bologna. And actually  even better. There is a non-high-speed\nto Bologna that doesn't run that often \nthat we would be able to make. And so we'll be spending\neven less to get on that one. It is possible that Sam and Adam have made it\nin front of me by now. And they're already in Padua. They could have gotten there. In that case \nwe're gonna have to be real sneaky when we get there. As we transfer trains. Because otherwise  we are toast. And I don't think\nI'm gonna get another run. And that'll be that. We'll see. But  in the meantime... I did finally get some food. The card did stipulate that... I have to put the pickle... ...on everything that I eat today. So... I am not a cheater. But I really need the calories. (full mouth)\nNo  it's good  actually. It's actually really good. I'm glad that I'm doing this. Alright  great. And in fact \nwelcome to Bologna. There's a train up towards Ben... ...in four minutes. Wait  do you know\nwhat platform? Well  come on  come on. What?\nCome down. What platform?! I don't know  but come down. Okay  I just\nwas gonna check here. Well  you're...\nVenezia... Eight! I'm keeping an eye out for them. Are they here? No. They are not. And I think that means that\nthey are following behind me. Which I think...\nwas their big mistake. Now... what we have to do is we have to find\nthe best train to Bologna. One that we can get\non safely  but also... one that'll get us there fast. So... I don't know what\npartenze means. Okay  so  there are\ntwo trains to Bologna. There's one in ten minutes \nthat's low speed. And then there's one\nabout 30 minutes after that  that's high speed. That'll cost me more... but it'll also get me\nthere at the same time while also buying me\nanother 30 minutes here that I could  you know \npotentially use to do challenges. So I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull\na challenge now  and then we'll have a\nlittle bit more information to make our decision with. But I have to make\nthat decision quickly. Okay. I'm going to go ahead\nand pull this card. Let's hope it's a good one. Desecrate ravioli. Desecrate ravioli. Acquire ravioli and Oreos. Swap the filling of at least\none raviolo and one Oreo  and eat the entirety of\nboth of your creations. Honestly  I'm still hungry. Oh  I guess that means we'll also\nhave to put the pickle on it. Mmm. Well  let's see if\nmaybe I can get that in before the one in eight minutes. There is a grocery right here. Oh  okay. I found the Oreos. We're gonna be able\nto find a ravioli. Ravioli. And it's so affordable. Okay. Okay  so I've secured\nmy Oreos  my ravioli. Which means that we can\nknock this challenge out pretty quickly  actually. So maybe we do just want to\nget on the train right now. Sam  he's on the move. It seems like he's headed\ndirectly towards us. He seems to be\non the ramp we're on. So I think our question is just... ...where do we get off? Because we don't want\nto get off too late. But we also don't want\nto get off too early and risk that he gets off\nbefore then. Right. We get to Ferrara at... We would still be\nheading to Ferrara. Yeah. So I think we are safe\nto get off in Ferrara. Well  the only question is \ndoes he get off before that? Well  if he gets off\nbefore then  we're still right in front of him. Yeah.\nWhat can you do? We just go get him on\na local train later  I guess. Yeah. No  that probably makes sense. Okay  so  I made it\nonto the train to Bologna. Did I think I would\nmake it this far? Yes. Because...\nhow else would I win? Now  if Sam and Adam are\nwhere I think they are  which is just getting into Padua  then they'll be able\nto get to Bologna right around the same time  maybe just a couple\nminutes after me. So that would be\na little worrisome. But I've been working on a plan. I wrote down a plan. This is the plan. I'm going to go rat mode. And for those of you\nunfamiliar with my game  here's the idea. Bologna's in my territory. So  as long as\nI just don't get caught by the end of the game \nI'll win. I think the best way\nto not get caught is to move as\nunpredictably as possible. Just hop on random trains \ngo random directions. Just don't leave my territory. And just don't get on\na predictable train. Because if I don't even\nknow where I'm going  they sure don't know\nwhere I'm going. And then how else\nare they gonna... get to where I'm going\nbefore I get there? That's the plan. We'll see how it goes. Sam  welcome back to Ferrara  Italy.\nI said it first. It's unclear exactly\nwhen Ben will arrive here. Yeah  we need to look\nat the departure board  but quite soon. His tracker is not far away at all. But his is going to be\n3:05  platform three. This is not it  but... allegedly this will be\nthe platform. We gotta find another departure\nboard in case it changes. It still says platform three. Yeah. Okay.\nOkay. Oh yeah. I think\nhe's getting in now. Oh god  oh god. So we probably\nneed to get out of view. 'Cause he's more... It's a busy platform. We need to be...\nspotting well to figure out whether\nhe gets off or not. I doubt he's getting off. Probably makes more sense\nfor him to be going. I expect him to\ncontinue to Bologna. Okay  wait \nI need to be recording. Because we're going\nto want to split up and take the train from\nboth sides probably. Probably?\nWe should get on a call. So just  if you haven't\nput it together... it's really important that if\nhe doesn't get off the train  that we catch it fast enough\nthat I can get him off the train. Because if we don't  then my run will start\nwhile we're on the train. And that will suck.\nFor me. Yeah  I'm gonna run\nto the back. Are you going far? Adam  you're starting\nat the back? Yeah. Yeah. Okay  we're looking for... Oh  where is he? Shoot! Tag! You got him? Alright  I'm coming. Here  Sam  you can film this. I'm gonna start figuring\nout what I'm gonna do. So  Ben... Do you want to\nknow what happened? Yes. Okay.\nYeah. Well  I was hoping... that it kind of looked like\nI had a bit of a plan  but it turns out that— So the train was\ndelayed five minutes. And I put my bag down\nto go put my stuff in  and then it left. And so that's what happened. It's like  you were\non the platform. Yeah  I was right\nin front of the train. I was like  oh  it's great.\nI've got five minutes. Great  I'll just\nrearrange myself. And it's gone. I actually noticed\nthat with another— another train that I took\ngot undelayed. Yeah  you can't\nundelay something. So we will be free\nat 3:59  Ben. (bleep) Right after\nwe get off the train. This sucks that this\nhas happened to me twice. Yeah. Okay  okay  okay  okay. It's  it's fine  it's fine. And I'm not even\nworried about it. Actually  it's good. I think Adam will have\nabout four minutes in Bologna. Ugggh! He's been making\nthese sounds for hours. Yeah  there was a\nreally great 3:11 train that would connect you\ndirectly to a train that would take you all the way\nto Innsbruck from Ferrara. Yeah  I know. Yeah.\nI'm aware of that. I figured. Yeah.\nThank you  Sam. Yeah  that's something\nthat I actually knew already. I don't want to do\na run today  Adam. Can you please go? I don't want to have to do\ntwo runs in one day. Just let me cook\nfor one second. I had a lot of plans\nbased on Ferrara. I had not thought through\nthat this might happen. I did not have plans\nout of Bologna. Tough. Yes  Sam  what is it? Have you considered\ngetting off here? Is this a stop? This is a stop. Oh.\nWhy'd I say that? I thought that it\ndidn't stop until Bologna. I am gonna get off here \nthank you so much. So be clear  you had not\nconsidered getting off here? To be clear  I didn't know\nthat the train stopped here. Okay. Alright. Bye  guys.\nSee you in Bratislava. Well... Welcome back  Sam. Maybe I shouldn't\nhave said that. I felt bad for him because\nI literally don't know how he would have\ngotten out of Bologna. No  I mean  at least now  he's got a shot at\ngetting somewhere. Hello! Okay. So we're on a train to Venice. I did not know that\nthis train existed. Get to Venice at 5. I guess we'll just kinda see\nwhat we can do from there. There he goes  Ben. There he goes.\nGood luck  Adam. But I am looking at\nthe routes and... It's not good.\nIt's not looking great. Caption+ by JS*\nTranscription: Roger Maiz  Haley Settembre Not looking awesome. It could— It's okay. I got off the train. Yeah.\nGot off the train. I'm gonna get somewhere. Yeah. You know what? It might go really good. You could find out. It might  it might. It definitely might  yeah. How would they find out? Well  they could watch\nnext episode right now. Whoa!\nOn Nebula. And then after watching\nthe next episode  they could listen to our exclusive\naftershow podcast  The Layover  where  you know  we break down\nevery single episode  and we talk about\nall the stuff that went on. We talk about— We break\ndown curveballs like this  all of the implications  how we sort of\nstrategize in the moment. It's a very interesting way to delve deep into Jet Lag\nif you're into that kind of thing. Yeah  especially\nepisodes like this where  you know \nquite a lot happens  and we're cutting it down a lot. And there's a lot more to explain. You know what else\nyou could do after you listen to\nthe Layover podcast and you watch the next\nepisode of Jet Lag early? You could watch The Getaway. The Getaway is\na series that we made that's only on Nebula. It's a reality competition series that is sort of like The Mole  except that we told everybody\nthat they were the mole. It's a lot of fun. And we shot it on\nreal cameras and everything. And it's pretty cool. Arguably one of the most\nhigh-budget pranks of of all time. Sort of  that's been made. Yeah.\nPretty fun. I mean  it's more than a prank \nbut fundamentally  it's just kind of gaslighting them.\nWell  what's fun— What's fun is that\nsort of it's a prank  but it's also a totally\nfunctional game. And that was a big part of sort of our role in\ndesigning it  right? Is that we were like \nwe want to make something that's funny and a prank  but that fully functions as \nyou know  a real competition. Yeah. I'll just add one other \nyou know  quick mention. I haven't mentioned this\nbefore  but you know  if you have someone\nwho you think would really enjoy\na Jet Lag-related gift  and is a big Jet Lag fan\nor whatever  we do now have\ngift cards to Nebula. So you can now gift\nearly access to Jet Lag and all this other stuff\nthat we've mentioned to... to a friend  to an enemy \nto a family member. To a lover.\nYeah. If you gave me one of those \nI would kiss you on the mouth. Okay  now let's put\nthe disclaimer here. The disclaimer says\nBen loves kissing on the mouth. No  no  it does not.\nIt does not say that. (laughs)\nIt does definitely not say that. But yeah. Are there any discounts\nif they sign up? Oh yes  there is a\nbig discount actually. Oh my gosh! If you go to\nnebula.tv/jetlag there. How's that spelled? 'jetlag'?\nYeah. J-E-T-L-A-G. Wow! It's also on screen. But anyway  that would\nget you 40% off. Yeah. 40% off? Pretty good. Annual subscription. That's a great deal. Pretty good deal. And also we get a little— We get a little cut of\nwhat you sign up with. (overlapping chatter) That is quite literally how\nwe pay to you know  fly to Italy  buy all the croissants\nthat Ben ate. Mhm.    Mhm.\nEt cetera. Yep.\nYeah. Yeah. There's a lot of croissants. Anyway  nebula.tv/jetlag. nebula.tv/jetlag. Bye."

        "transcript": "Hello  and welcome back to our three-day game\nof tag across Europe. Right now  we're nearing\nthe end of day two  and we've ended up right back\nin the middle of the map. At the end of the last episode  we caught Ben on a train\nin Ferrara  Italy. That was bad news for Adam  who had to start his run\ntrapped on a train heading away from his territory\nand deeper into Italy. He managed to get off\nthat train here  in San Pietro in Casale \nhaving already lost some ground and a huge chunk of his\n45-minute head start. Now he's on a train heading\nback up towards Venice  with little budget and no plan. Ben and I  meanwhile  were forced to take the train\nall the way down to Bologna  where we'll wait out the\nrest of our freeze period as we figure out how\nwe're going to catch Adam. Hello.\nWell  we're in Bologna. Yep. You did tag me  Sam \nbut I made it to Bologna. I made it here. Technically  not as a Runner. Okay  well \nbut I still did it  though. Adam is heading up to Venice  so as soon as we're out of\nour little rest period here  we're gonna have to figure out the fastest way\nup to Venice as well. I mean  I got on\nthis train to Venice. It's gonna use up\nalmost all my coins. I'll have 710 when I get there. If they make the 4:01\nfrom Bologna  they'll get to Venice\n20 minutes after me. If they don't make that train  they'll get to Venice\nan hour after me. And the difference\nbetween 20 minutes and an hour\nis a big difference. I... don't know\nwhat to do. (snickers) I feel like Adam... he's gotta try something\ndifferent this time. It's been made clear that trying to cross the Alps by going all the way east\nto Trieste is tricky. Yeah. But... Well the other route would be to go up into Austria\nthrough Innsbruck. Yeah  so basically... What you were trying to do.\nWhat I was doing. Which  you know  if he does attempt that \nand then we catch him  it's good for you. Certainly good for me. Maybe not good for the\ndynamism of this show. No. Dear passengers  we inform you that\nthe train has stopped due to ongoing\npolice investigations. They said that the train\nhas been stopped ...due to a police investigation. We've been stopped here\nfor a while. (passengers cross-talk) Should I switch gears  maybe? Alright  Ben \nwe have 30 seconds. Alright. We're gonna quickly\nsee if we can get a ticket on the high-speed train\nto Venice. But it probably won't work.\nUnlikely. And if not  we're actually\ngetting right back on this train. Yep. Four  three  two  one. Alright  Adam \nwe're coming for you. It's there.\nOh. Right  that's it?\nYeah  yeah  do it. No  it hasn't! I promise it hasn't! It's still here! No! Ben! Alright. Let's just get on the 4:10. Alright. Off to Venice. Alright  we've been\nstopped here for 10 minutes. I just— I don't have time\nto just sit on this train. I just— I simply don't have time. Okay. Guess we're gonna\nhave to switch gears. (passenger speaking Italian)\nExcuse me. Oh  scusa.\nScusi. Oh  ha! Scusa. Okay  alright.\nAny trains running? Is it just this train or...\nwhat's going on? Okay. Mantova. Alright. We're going to Nogara! (sighs) Ugh  didn't have a choice.\nDidn't have a choice. (sighs)\nSimply didn't have a choice. Okay  it looks like\nAdam's doing something weird. It looks like he\ntransferred in Monselice  and now he's going... Yeah  I'm trying to figure out if he's turning—\nWest? Good. Apparently there's\nbeen an accident up ahead in front of Padua. So  he might not actually\nbe heading that way because he wants to. He might've had to. The problem is... ...we might run into\nthe same problem later down the line. But  if his train was\ngoing to get delayed 55  our train is one hour behind. So by the time we get there \nit should be cleared. I mean  as long as\ntheir delays are accurate. Which... ...don't seem to be the case. It seems to me like all of\nthe other routes are quite slow. And we have no idea\nwhat he could be doing. It's really hard to plan for that. I think we'll just have to wait. If certainly if he\ndid not intend to do that  he is going to be panicking. Hello. A lot happening. So I... I was on my train to Venice. It got stopped due to a... ...police incident?\nI don't really know. They said it was going\nto be late an hour. And I mean  they were\nright behind me. So I figured I couldn't\njust stay there. So I just got on... ...a train. It doesn't really go\nthe right way  but I mean \nit puts me west enough that there's a line up to Verona. And then I can try to make\nmy way up to Innsbruck. I mean  I'll be honest with you.\nThe timing's not great. It's not great timing. I don't... really know\nwhat to do. I'm in a bit of a pickle. So... Benjamin Doyle and I\nwere talking  and... we think that Adam probably... is gonna just run it back. Did I— Wait  did\nI say Ben or Adam? I don't even remember. My brain's pretty (bleep)-ed. All I've eaten today is vinegar. Wait  I meant Adam. He's the Runner. 'Cause... he's gonna just go\nback to Verona. Once he's over there \nhe kinda can't come east without at least\ncoming close to Padua. And he knows  most likely  that we just followed\nright behind him. Or at least he\nprobably suspects that. I think he almost certainly\nis going through Verona  or has to go through Verona. Which  I don't think\nit's a bad strategy for him to get up— to try\nto get up to Innsbruck. I think the main reason\nhe might've been avoiding it is because it's really high-risk. Because if we catch him  that's gonna set me up quite well. Yep. So  I think he preferred\nto be over there  so that he could just run\nout the clock  hopefully  and make it so that I just\ndon't have enough time to get back into my zone. Right. But now  of course  this little delay on the train\nhas  I think  forced his hand. Alright  welcome to Nogara. I believe.\nLet's double check that. Yeah  Nogara! Things are not great \nat the moment. In fact I would go\nso far as to say that they're pretty bad. But I have a plan. Alright  Ben and Sam have\nprobably already explained this  but from where I am to make any meaningful progress\ntowards my region  I need to go either\nup through Verona or over and up through Padua. They are probably in\neither Padua or Verona or in between them right now  and there's a high-speed line\nthat goes between those cities  and I am down here on\nthe low-speed line. And I would have to go\nover and up  and basically... ...they will just ping-pong\nback and forth and block me no matter what I try to do. So the only solution is\nto try to trick them. So step one is I am going to try to\npost up here for a while and earn a lot of coins. And then in the morning... there's a train to Venice\nwhere there's a little trick that I think that maybe I can pull. But either way \nwe need a lot of coins  and we have very few. So it's time to pull a challenge. Burn this card. This card must be burned within\nfive minutes of pulling it. If you fail to burn this card\nin five minutes  it is vetoed. The card does not need\nto be entirely burned  but it must be on fire\nat some point within the time limit. The source of the fire cannot be\nsomething traveling with you. If you unintentionally\ncatch anything else on fire  the card is automatically vetoed. Oh  no. No  no  no  no  no  no \nno  no  no  no  no  no  no... Alright  Sam  we're\nhere where Adam gone off and seemingly might have\nbeen forced off his train. Yeah  no issue so far. They haven't mentioned\nany issue. Yeah  no  I think\nthey're gonna let us through. So we might not have to\ndeal with that at all. It sucks for Adam. ♪ It sucks for Adam ♪ Sorry  Adam. Adam  this one's just for you. I'm sorry. I'm not #TeamSam  like I told him. What?\nI was just making that up. You lied? I'm #TeamAdam all the way. If you're watching this  but... You lying to him \nor you lying to me? No  no  no \nno  no  no  no  no. Lighter  lighter  lighter  lighter. Okay  I need a general store. Shoot. This is not good. Are there any candles? This restaurant? Uggh! Is there a general store? It's too far away. Shoot. Ugggh. Might be a fire in here.\nFire  fire  fire  fire... Upon further analysis... we have now been\nstopped here for... longer than\na normal station stop? Yeah. Well \nI'm trying to figure out if... No. Ahh. That explains why there's\nliterally no one else in the car. Yeah. Okay  well  it seems like\nthere is still an accident  and they are kicking\nus off the train. You were looking this way. You... you're... You should have noticed that there was literally\nno one in the car. Well... I don't know. I thought a lot of people\ngot off the train here. Now we need to figure\nout what's going on. There's a lot of very confused\nand upset people here. Surely my best bet\nis the train station. Surely my best bet has\nto be the train station and just hope that there's\nsome little stand there or some store  something. Excuse me  sorry \ndo you have a lighter? A lighter? I have to burn this. I have to burn this. You see? Maybe... (wheezes) Grazie mille. Oh. Oh  come on. (horn honking) Yeah! Grazie mille! Grazie mille! (cackles) Ben  Adam was on this. This was his train? Yeah. See  3:10  3:27.\nThis was his train. But it's still not moving. It's haunted. So  here's the thing  Ben. Here  let's sit down. If he... If we don't move... Oh  wait  there's a train\nto Mantova in six minutes. Should we follow him? Alright  let's keep going. Create a Disputation on the\nPower and Efficacy of Indulgences. Write down 95 of your\nopinions on paper. The average word\ncount of your opinions must be at least five. Each opinion must be unique and\ndistinct from all previous opinions. Publicly recite all opinions. (sputters) Sure. Totally. So you know \nsome challenges we put on because we think\nthey're really clever  and we think it'll be\nreally interesting to see how you solve them. And other challenges\nwe put on because we think that they'll be really \nreally annoying to do  and we think that will\nbe funny to watch. And this is one of\nthe second kind. Okay  let's find...\na pencil and paper. Uh  penna? Penna?\nPenna? Can I buy it from you? Uno moment. It's yours. Uh  okay. Look  is there anyone\nwe could find who might know anything\nabout what's going on? I heard someone say\n\"it doesn't matter which\"  which would indicate something\nthat felt maybe he said that... I don't know. He said Italian words\nand stuff that... you know... I speak French  it's kind of... Sam  this is\nnot very heartening. No  it's like  it's word  but you just add a  you know \na little Italian flair. I'm gonna go try and\nfind someone to talk to. I mean  there's\na conductor there. Oh  okay. But there's a lot of people. Well  let's just see if\nwe can glean any information. Well  I mean  if we were\nto take that other train  we'd have to go this very second. But I don't think that makes sense. No  I think if we\nwant to catch up with him  It's in our best interest\nto bank on... Yeah.\n...getting to Venice. So  this is next one to Venice? Yes. And you don't— We\ndon't know how long the delay? Yes.\nOkay. I don't know if\nyou know what happened. No  we didn't know. Someone has been hit\nby a train. Okay. Two stations away from here. So  it's gonna—\n(mutters to passenger) It happened an hour ago. And it's gonna be\na long day for it because they're gonna\narrive an ambulance. It's gonna arrive...\nOh  okay. So they have\nto analyze everything. So you think a lot more?\nYeah. Okay. I mean  I don't know. She didn't seem\noptimistic  but... Mm  yeah  I mean... Let's look. I mean  hopefully that\nmeans the person's alright  if the ambulance is showing up. But...\nOr they just gotta... Well...\n...collect their head. Oh  everything is cancelled. Everything is cancelled\nexcept for Mantova. Which we just missed. Ciao. Grazie  grazie. Grazie.\nGrazie mille. Alright. Let's find a nice place to write down all of\nour opinions  shall we? Ugh  this is so stupid. Each of the opinions\nhas to be different and has to have\nat least five words in it. New York... ...is the world's best city. Charlotte... ...is a mid city. Los Angeles... ...is a bad city. My girlfriend... Maeve... ...is beautiful. Ben... is... (groans)\n(bleep) Okay  okay  it's fine. I think we should\nprobably get on that train. Yeah  well let's—\nWe don't want to miss it. Let's be where trains are. If it moves  it moves.\nIf it doesn't  it doesn't. This is so reminiscent of... ...'s-Hertogenbosch. Yeah. Look  this one train\ncould decide the whole game  based on when it leaves. I mean  minutes matter  and we're losing\nso many of them. The train has stopped due to ongoing\npolice investigations following an accident\ninvolving a person. Feels like the smallest\nsandwich I've ever had. Everyone should\nown pickled onions. Cheetos have too much dust. New York City should\noutlaw broker's fees. I don't know if you know\nabout broker's fees  but they're an outrage. (dog barking loudly) Public transit should be free. Jerry Seinfeld should get over ...the Pop-Tarts thing. Elon Musk has ruined Twitter. This challenge was... ...incredibly annoying. (sighs) That's 95. We have to go back to\nthe train station anyway to make them think that\nI'm going up to Verona. So  let's go recite\nour opinions there. Adam can get to Verona\nat 7:50. So that's almost certainly\nwhat he's doing. So he's probably going\nto end his day in Verona. Yeah. So we just have to\nfigure out if there's any way we can get to Verona\nbefore the end of the day. Seems increasingly unlikely unless this train starts\nmoving real  real soon. Alright. There's the stazione. Alright  now \nthe challenge specifies... that I have to state\nall of the opinions in public. I do not want to freak anybody out. I like the color blue. The color green is solid. New York is the world's best city. Do you have any funny... Let's play 20 questions  Sam. Let's play a fun game. 20 questions. I thought of someone. Is it a man? Yes.\nOkay. According to gender binaries \nwhich  you know. People are allowed\nto identify as a man. Well  you didn't ask.\nIn a gender spectrum. ...whether this person identified. I said  is— is— is they— I believe\ngender is a construct. Sam  a person who\nidentifies as a man is a man. Would you disagree? I feel like it's more regressive Pass.\n...to take this angle. That's not what I said. I said that... ...the gender spectrum\nis complicated. And also gender is\na social construct. This 20 questions game\nis falling apart rapidly. So  with the end\nof the day approaching and still no sign of movement  things weren't looking\ngood for Ben and I. Meanwhile  over in Nogara  Adam had ample time\nto earn some coins. The... bead is... ...not that fun. The bean is not that fun—\nThe beach is not that fun. Despite the pouring rain  Adam was able to finish reading\nhis theses to the public. Knowing he wasn't planning\non taking the train to Verona out of fear that\nwe were already there  he decided to pull\nanother challenge. This challenge forced him\nto post an AMA on Twitter where he had to answer any question that anyone asked him\nfor the next two minutes. Crushed ice or cubed ice? Crushed ice for sure. Do I like Chappell Roan? Yes  I actually do like\nChappell Roan. How's the public transport in Italy? I think it's pretty good. How do you sleep and otherwise\ntake care of yourself during the game? Not enough. I would say not enough. What's the H\nin your name stand for? It stands for Hamilton \ngreat question. Alright  well that was\nnot that bad. With another\n750 coins in his pocket and plenty of time\nleft in the day  Adam decided to keep going\nand pulled another challenge. This time he had to\nwrite a joke about Italy that he would post online in\na head-to-head competition with another joke about Italy\nthat had been written by ChatGPT. If the audience voted\nhis joke funnier  he'd win the coins.\nBut if ChatGPT won  he'd get stuck in\na 30-minute veto period  something he really couldn't afford  as it could trap him in Nogara\ntomorrow morning. Sure  whatever  I can do this. Okay. Let's think. Let's think. To make matters worse\nfor Adam  back in Monselice  our train had finally\nstarted moving again. I really like it\nwhen the trains move. You know... Trains are way less cool\nwhen they don't move. It's one of the best things\na train can do. Well  because when\na train doesn't move  it's effectively just a building. And buildings are not as cool. With just about an hour\nleft in the day  we were able to make it\nas far as Padua  not Verona like we had hoped. But when we got off the train  we realized that Adam hadn't\ngone to Verona either. Again  because he had assumed we had made it all the way there\nand were waiting for him. So instead he was still in\nNogara trying to write a joke. Mario is Italian. So we ended our day\noutside of Padua Station waiting to see what move he was planning on\ntaking tomorrow morning. Alright  well... it has taken a\nhumiliatingly long time to write a joke about Italy. I think it took me\n50 minutes... ...but I have done it. It also is the end of the day. So I actually\ndon't even have time to post it on Twitter \nbut I have my joke. This— I've written it down to prove that I did write it\nbefore the rest period. I'm not gonna try to write\nthe joke over the rest period. You can freeze-frame that\nif you really want the proof. But for you non-freeze-framers  I will reveal what the joke is tomorrow morning at 6 am\nat this very spot. Good night! Good... (clears throat) Good morning! It is 6 am. And it is the final day\nof competition. Good morning from Padua. Or Padova.\nOr Padova. Why do—\nHere's a question I have. Why are there names in\nother languages for cities? That doesn't make any sense.\nIt's an important question. But I think the more\nimportant question is  there's a train to Verona\nleaving in three minutes. I think at this point  we definitely need to just\nwait and see what Adam does. If he was going to Verona \nhe would have gone to Verona. Yeah  because let's check \nlet's check what he's up to. So  I actually took\nso long writing the joke that if I were to do\nthe challenge now and fail  I wouldn't be able to\nexecute on my plan. And I have enough coins\nright now to execute at least on\nthe first part of it. So I don't want to risk that. So I'm gonna...\nset that aside for now. I'm gonna keep\nthat challenge active  but I'm gonna finish it later. Now  I am assuming... that they are in Verona. And if I went up to Verona \nthey would catch me. So  we are waiting\non a train at 6:14. So  I'm gonna go ahead\nover to that platform where the train comes \n'cause it's not this one. And then I will explain\nwhat the plan is. He's in Nogara still. I don't I think that\nwe want to go to Verona before we see what he does. I think I agree \n'cause I guess we're worried that he would go to... Venice. He could go to Venice \nor he could go down to Bologna. And either way  if we get\non that train to Verona  then we'll be behind him. Bologna wouldn't make a\ntremendous amount of sense for him. No  I think\nhe's gonna come here. Well  toward  yeah \nvery possibly  yeah. I think he's gonna go\ntowards Venice in 10 minutes. Yeah. And that's gonna pass\nthrough here. So  as I'm sure\nthey've pointed out  in order for me to make basically\nany progress into my region  I have to make it through\none of two choke points. I either have to go\nthrough Verona  or I have to go through Padua. And  you know...\nthat's not great. So  we are gonna have\nto try to trick them. So I imagine when\nI head towards Venice  they will head to Padua\nto cut me off. So the plan is to make\na secret transfer. There's a stop on my way\ncalled Monselice. I'm going to get to\nMonselice at 7:21. There is a train\n– a different train – from Monselice to Venice\nat 7:28. So the plan is... Whoop. Is that me? That's my train. Anyway  the plan is... (train brakes hiss) I am going to switch\nonto a different train going up to Venice\nat Monselice. And hopefully\nif they're not paying super close attention\non the tracker  they'll think\nI was just stopped on my train for\na little longer than usual. And then when my train\ngoes through Padua... they will assume I must be on it  and they'll get on it. But actually  I'll be\non a different train that's a little faster\nthat will pass them. And then I'll get to Venice first. And then in Venice  I have a quick\nfour-minute transfer where I can head towards Udine. Look  is it a great plan? Who's to say? But it is a plan  and that's... better than I had for\nmost of yesterday. If he comes this way \ntowards us... he could get off the train here \nor he could continue. Which is to say  if we stayed here  there's a pretty good chance\nwe'd get switcherooed. That is true \nand we know that... it is possible for someone\nto successfully switcheroo. Yes.\nBut  in order to do that  you need to know... you need to... Oh  you don't\nneed to know  Sam. Well  you don't need to know  but it's a lot easier if you do know that you do have to\nevade the Chasers. I would just say  if it looks like\nhe's coming this way  it might be worth\ntrying to find a station slightly closer to him that he has less likelihood\nof getting off on  so that we know with confidence\nwe can get on his train. That could be good  yeah. Okay  so let me explain\nwhat's going on  because it's kinda crazy  and neither team realizes\nwhat's about to happen. Right now  Adam is\non his way to Venice  knowing full well that we're\nprobably in front of him. Which we are. His plan to trick us is\nto get off on a random stop – the station in Monselice – and get on a different train\nthat also goes to Venice. He's hoping that\nthis will confuse us when we try to\nintercept him in Padua  and trick us into getting\non the wrong train. But at the last minute  we decided not to try to\nintercept him in Padua at all. Instead  we figured\nthat we should go further down the line\nto intercept him earlier. So now  we're also\ngoing to Monselice. That means that both teams\nare heading to the same place  and Adam is going to be attempting\nhis secret transfer switcheroo at a station where\nwe happen to be waiting. What's gonna happen? I have... no idea. Okay. Here we are. Whew! Oh boy. It's chilly  okay  let's... First things first  let's figure out\nwhere he's getting in. Yeah. These ominous clouds are\nlooking rather ominous. The weather is foreboding. But it's  you know... It's setting the scene for\nAdam's devastating catch. Okay  this seems to\nbe the train that... ...he is arriving on. Yep  that's the one. Okay.\n14 minutes. Okay  we got 14 minutes\nto figure out the plan. It seems to me like... the most intuitive thing\nwould be to... ...stay underground. Yeah  we could just pop out. Yeah.\nAnd hop on. And just stay underground\nuntil the train gets here. And just hop on at the last minute. So then he's trapped  and we have 20 minutes\nto search the train. Right. Hold on  take this. Sam... I gotta get my stealth outfit. Is it also the\n'it's kinda cold out' outfit? No  Sam. 'Cause it is kinda cold out. No. This is all about stealth. Okay. Look  I'm unrecognizable.\nWait  who are— Where'd... Where did Ben go  right? Where did Ben go? But Sam  don't worry. I'm right here. What?\nSam  don't worry. I'm right here. You just couldn't see because I'm wearing\nmy stealth outfit. Say something only\nthe real Ben would know. Bing-bong. We're gonna be selling\nthis stealth outfit on the Nebula store. For how much? However much a black\nUniqlo sweater costs plus like $20. Yeah  I mean  it looks\nlike he's almost here. (faint rumbling)\nI think I hear his train. Yep. (train rumbles past) It's a single decker. Okay  that's good. Well  it's a smaller train. (train brakes hiss) ...963 off Trenitalia to... (train doors open) ...departure at 7:30\nat platform 1. (sighs) Okay. Oh  he's getting off. Oh my god  what do we do? Ben  down  down  down. He'll come via here. Did he see us? I don't know. So this is Monselice. And I am getting off of this train \nwhich goes to Venice  and I'm getting on this train \nwhich also goes to Venice. If he doesn't\ncome down in a minute  we should go up and\nget on that train. Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait. We only have... 30 seconds. Okay Ben  up here  up here. Yeah  get on. (train doors beeping) Did he change trains  maybe? The hope is that... ...they will not realize\nI have switched trains. They won't pay that\nclose of attention. And then when that train... goes through Padova \nthey'll think I'm on it. They'll get on it. Clearing Padova for me. Where I can make a transfer. And if I get past Padova  I've\ngotten past the major chokepoint. What does the tracker say? It still shows him— He must have gotten\nonto the other one. He must have seen us. He must have just spotted us. Because for a few seconds \nhe didn't. By the time I was running. I mean  you were in front of me  but by the time\nI ran up the stairs  I don't think he had seen me. Well  there was no way\nhe saw me  Sam  'cause of my stealth outfit  so... Of course  of course. Yeah  he's still... He's still in Monselice. Come on  Sam! Caption+ by JS*\nTranscription: Jacob Star Wah! What happened?\nBen  what happened? He fell off the ladder.\nHelp... Help me. What?\nSam  help me. Well...\nOh  my ribs. We can't really—\nGet the ladder. We can't really\ncall an ambulance until we finish the ad reads.\n(coughs) Yeah  we still have\nto do the ad read. We have to do that. But then we could get you\nto the hospital  I think. (groans) Help me. Get the ladder off me.\nBen  tell them— Do the— Get the ladder off of me.\nLook to camera. Buddy  we wanna help you. But first  you gotta look\nto camera. Tell him that\nthe finale is up right now. The next episode's\nthe last one of the season. Yeah. The finale is up\nright now on Nebula. The last episode \nyou can watch it right now. Yeah? Oh  oh... Find out who wins?\nHelp me. Was that good? I think it was okay.\nCan we get one more? (mumbles incoherently)\nBen  can you make sure— Can you make sure that\nthe camera can see you? Oh  I think his face— I think the hat's making—\nYeah. Yeah  you need to\nmake sure that you... Can we do just\nstraight down the lens?\n(coughs) Yeah.\nYeah. And then  the finale\nis up now on Nebula. And try to enunciate.\nBe clear with your words. The finale is up\nright now on Nebula. You can sign up with\nnebula.tv/jetlag... code. Yeah.\nThat was pretty good but I think the code was\na little bit swallowed.\nYou forgot that percentage. Yeah  and the percentage. Ooh  I swallowed my teeth. Yeah  mention the percentage. Yeah  but the code. Yeah  if we—\nI mean  maybe doing— Yeah  here. Now go.\nIs that better? (gasps deeply) The finale's up\nright now on Nebula. Sign up with the code 'jetlag'. 40% off.\n40%... Okay  that's good. (groans) Yeah  alright.\nI think we got it. Why did you put\nthe ladder back on? This looks painful. Ben  we're gonna go get lunch. Do you want anything? Yeah  we'll call somebody. Do you want anything?\nYeah  do you want anything? Help... me. I don't— Yeah  okay.\nI don't think they have that. Help will be here in\nlike probably a few hours. Yeah. Thank you for the support."

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nto the grand finale of our 72-hour game\nof tag across Europe. Right now  it's the\nmorning of day 3  and the whole game has just\nbeen turned on its head. Adam  who had been screwed\nby a line closure last night and forced to head up to Nogara  was in a terrible position\ngoing into this final day. Ben and I were able\nto set ourselves up right along the path\nhe was taking to Padua  and we figured that\nit was all but guaranteed that we were going to catch him. But at the last moment  in the station where we\nwere waiting for him  Adam got off of his train and\ntransferred onto a different train that was also going to Padua\nin order to trick us down the line. Not realizing what he had done  we ended up getting\non his original train and missed our easy catch. Now we're both on separate\ntrains heading to Padua. Our train will get there\na few minutes earlier  giving us another chance\nto try to catch him there. But to make matters\neven more complicated  Adam doesn't even realize\nwhat's happened at all. He assumed that we were all the\nway back in Padua to begin with  and his whole train swap\nwas meant to trick us into searching\nthe wrong train there. So basically  this is a giant mess. Adam has no idea what's going on  we've just majorly screwed up  and we have one last\nchance to catch him before we lose\nall of our advantage. Got it?\nGood. Here we go. (groans exhaustedly) Phew  okay. Ahh. Alright  we will be\nin Padova... in about 20 minutes. So we'll see if this works. Okay. If he got on the later train... then presumably... we can get out\non the next stop. Well  the next stop is Padova. So  I mean  we can do it again  but that train does\ncontinue to Venice. So it's going to be another\nof the same situation. And the problem now is... if he got— if he gets off\nin Padova  and we get on... Yeah. He actually has\noptions out there. Right. We should be able to...\nyou know... Okay. Attempt number two. Yes. Okay  welcome back. Let's see where\nhis train is getting in. Five. Okay. I would have had a\nreally good route to Austria if we had gotten that. Well  then maybe\nit's good that happened. I could have\nconnected in Verona to a non-stop train\nto Innsbruck. Well  Sam  you're never gonna\nget on a train to Innsbruck if we don't catch him  so... I know. Eyes on the prize. It's tricky. I mean \nthis is a busy station... with multiple exits. I think we're gonna\nhave a better chance if we go on different\nparts of the platform. If—\nYeah  I agree. If the most important\nthing is spotting Adam and seeing what he does... then we're just gonna want to\ncover as much of it as we can. I agree. Okay  you go to that side \nI'll go to this side. Stay behind the vending machines. And I guess focus on... focus on... the center\nof the platform. It's fine if he spots us from\nthe far end of the platform  because he can't get past us. But we cannot let him\nget past us in the center of the platform. Alright. So if this has all worked... then they should not be here. And maybe they won't be. Do you have his location? For some reason \nI can't look at location. Oh  train's here.\nTrain is here. In fact  maybe\nthey won't be here. It would be cool if they weren't. We're gonna start by\ntrying for track 8. Track 8 has a train to Treviso. If it's leaving a little bit late \nwe might be able to get on it. Nope  already left. Okay. Then we have to decide\nif we're going to... Verona or Montebelluna. I say Verona. I know Verona's the wrong way  but it allows us to get on\nthat line up to Innsbruck. I felt like I got\na really good look at everyone getting off  but... Hard to know  100%. You thought you\nmaybe did see him get off? No  no  no. I thought I got\na pretty good look at everyone getting off  so I— Oh yeah  I'm\npretty sure I did too. So I think if we don't see him... in the next couple minutes... we quickly get on. No  no. No  let's go to Montebelluna. Montebelluna's better. Okay. Well... Step one  I guess  worked? I don't know. I guess it depends\non where they are. The train leaves\nin three minutes. I'm gonna see if I can get\na more precise location on him. No  it's still quite big. This damn tracker. Okay  well  look. We're making it past Padova. And that was the big choke point. So I actually think\nthat's pretty good. I don't know if we're\nmaking it past Padova because my plan worked  or if we're making it Padova... for some other reason \nbut I'm taking the win. Right  I think it's\ndecision time  Ben. Alright. I think\nwe get on that train. You ready? Go quick.\nYeah  go. Don't start\nsearching yet  wait. Please stand\nclear of the door. Man. We missed him twice. I wonder if\nhe had a disguise. No! There's no way he\nhad a disguise again. I mean... The train did wait a little while\nto leave once we got on. Maybe he was able to slip off\nwithout us spotting him. (rasps) It's impressive moves. But I still don't think it's going\nto be enough to save his run  because we're still in front of him. We're still\nin front of him  but... Attempt number three. He's moving west. Okay  so he's probably\ngoing towards Verona? Anyway  hello. Welcome back to\nVenezia Mestre. I feel awesoooome. If we're going west \nwe need to... We need to get\na high-speed ticket. Okay. Let's find a ticket machine. I think he's just\ntaken a turn north. Oh. North?\nHe went west of the station  but it looks like he's maybe... Okay  so that's to Treviso. Maybe? And it looks like he could\nbe going up to Castelfranco. Yeah  yeah  that must be\nwhat he's doing. Castelfranco  so he's trying to— So we might want to\ngo up to Treviso. There is a train to\nUdine leaving at 2— leaving in 2 minutes \nbut that would be— No  no  that's too much. Oh  no  no  no  wait. But that stops in Treviso.\nThat goes through Treviso. So that is...\nPlatform... Platform 4  this one. Yeah  because\nhe's definitely— he's— He's now definitely\non that line north. So I think we definitely\nwant to get on this. Alright  welcome\nto Castelfranco Veneto. I believe that you  the audience \nhave been here a few times. But this is my first time\nin Castelfranco Veneto. Now... I have a few options. I could go northwest up\nto Bassano  to Trento  like Sam did yesterday \nup to Innsbruck and over. I could go to Verona\nand then go up and over. Or I could do\nwhat I did the first time  which is go to Gorizia\nand then up. Or I could try to go\nup through Villach. And I know it sounds great \nso many options. But actually almost all\nof them are very bad. I think that it would\nstill be a huge mistake to go northwest. That is not really any\nfurther in my territory. And if Sam tags me \nand he goes next  it will not be hard\nat all for him to get back into his territory\nanywhere up along that line. So I have to go east. In terms of going east \nthere are the two options. Now... one is the thing\nI did the first time: Gorizia  which is still\nnot a terrible option. The second one is\nto go up through Villach. And let me tell you  I would\nlove to go up through Villach. But it's almost impossible. There is... There are two trains\ntoday that do it. One at 10 am  one at 4 pm. They're both high-speed. And they take over three hours. Which means that they\ncost over 4 000 coins. And they leave from Venice  which is... not a good\nplace for me to go  because I think that Ben and Sam\nwould be very likely to catch me. But on the other hand \nif I did get on that train  I think it would win me the game. No matter what I do \nI need more coins. Which is why it's time for me to finally complete\nmy joke challenge. Did you just buy a\npacket of plain crackers? No  they're cheese-flavored. Oh. So Ben  it looks like \nif we want to... we can connect almost\ndirectly to Castelfranco. The thing is \nthat will be on the line that he will take  or would take  between Castelfranco\nand Treviso  and it looks like it makes\nall the same stops  because it stops at\nAlbaredo  Istrana  Paese. I think we should post up\non the line between Treviso and Castelfranco  because I think\nhe probably... probably is going to go\nthat way. If he does take that train... he'll get on in about\n15 minutes after we do. So we'll have time to respond. Yup. Okay  so here's the plan. Right now  Ben and I are\ntransferring onto a train directly to Castelfranco Veneto \nwhere Adam is. The problem is \nAdam has the option of taking a train\nbefore we get there that goes the opposite way\non the same line. We figure that he's\nprobably going to do that  since it leaves soon\nand goes the right way. So our plan is to get off at\nthe stop before Castelfranco and catch him where\nhis train goes through there. The problem is  if Adam decides\nnot to get on that train  like if he decides to\nstay in Castelfranco to keep doing challenges  getting off on that stop would\nleave us totally stranded without anywhere to go\nfor at least an hour. So we're gonna have to\nwatch the tracker closely and make sure\nwe get this call right. Anyway  back to Adam \nwhose fate now relies on having written a good\njoke about Italy. My joke is: So I've written my joke. Now it's time for ChatGPT\nto write its joke. That does not make any sense. Okay  well... This is gonna be\nhumiliating  if I lose to \"Why did the tomato turn red?\nIt saw the pasta sauce.\" That will be truly devastating. It's sort of... You could make the argument that it's sort of\na brilliant anti-joke. Just a complete non-sequitur. And people may like that. That would suck. Oh  Adam just\ntweeted the joke. Oh yeah? So he's doing challenges. Adam—\nDo we wanna vote? Yes. Adam the comedy writer should\nhopefully be able to... Okay  well I figured\nout which joke is Adam's. It's number one. So  number two...\nis getting my vote. It looks like he's\nprobably gonna win. Well...\nWanna give more space  Ben? See  this is\nhumiliating though  because this makes it look\nlike I wrote number two. Yeah  that's kind of\nwhat you need sometimes. Jet Lag is a bit of a\ngame of humiliation. Alright  it's\nbeen five minutes. It's time to check the votes. And god  am I scared. Please don't  surely. Hey! Alright! Ah. Not even close! Not even— 76 to 24%. Sort of devastating that that\neven got 24%  but that's fine. Okay  750 coins. So if I wanted to do that crazy... train option to Villach... I would need 1 700 more coins in the next  I think  15 minutes. Let's see what we\ncan accomplish here. Distinguish accents. Listen to Amy's video  in which a given phrase\nis read by a French person \nan Italian person  an Austrian person \nand a Swiss person. Then you must successfully\nmatch each video with the correct country of origin. If you get any matches wrong \nthis card is automatically vetoed. Uh-oh. Okay  Adam is\ngonna head our way. He's gonna leave in five minutes. It looks like he's a\nlittle outside the station. Yeah  but he could\neasily get to a train within a minute or so there. Yeah. But if we get to Castelfranco \nand he's still there... Great. Yeah. Then we can just trap him. He has no other way out. Yeah. I was worried about this one. Okay! Let's find somewhere to\nwatch Amy's quiz  shall we? If we do this well \nand quickly  then we— This could— It could\nbe good  actually. Let's really lock in here. One is Italian \none is Austrian  one is Swiss. Sorry  buddy.\nThat's how the jets lag. Sorry  buddy. I guess\nthat's how the jets lag. Sorry  buddy. I guess\nthat's how the jets lag. Okay  that all\nsounded identical to me. I'm gonna be honest \nthey sounded identical. Two  I think  is Italian. Two  she  I believe  is Italian. Sorry  buddy.\nThat's how the jets lag. Sorry  buddy. I guess\nthat's how the jets lag. Sorry  buddy. I guess\nthat's how the jets lag. No  no  okay  I'm switching. One is Italian. Okay  here are\nyour answers. Your first speaker was Rocco. He's Italian.\nYes! Your second speaker\nwas Martina. She's Austrian.\nDamn it! And your third speaker\nwas Evan  and they are Swiss. So  congrats.\nOr sorry  or whatever. Hope you're having fun\nout there. Bye! It's fine. Sam  he's going\nfurther from the station. Interesting. If he was going\nto head this way  he would be leaving\nin two minutes. That's true. I don't know. Trusting the tracker is\nalways a dangerous game. I know  but... I know  I agree  but... We have five minutes to decide. Well  I guess\nwe have 30 minutes to explore\nCastelfranco Veneto. Oh  I guess it's called that because there's a castle\nin the middle  maybe? Let's see  let's see\nif that's the case. I mean... Seems conclusive? Yeah  that train has left  and the tracker really shows\nhim right out in that place. Maybe he just doesn't\nhave the budget? Or maybe for some reason \nhe misread the maps  and he doesn't think\nwe can get there in time. Yeah  anyway. Hopefully this is it. Alright  I believe that we... are arriving at what\nhas to be the castle. The Castelfranco. That's pretty fun. Quite  quite the situation\ngoing on up here. It's like a whole fortress. I don't have a ton of time. I have to go back to the\ntrain station in a second. But let's see if we\ncan take a peek inside. Look at those clouds. Yeah  they look spooky here. Those clouds do not look good. Let's maybe not do a foot chase in the middle of the\napocalypse  please. We'll do what we gotta do. What if he... If he hits us with a... with a tracker off thing? We book it to the station. Yeah. Oh  that's true. Oh  oh. Maybe that's what he's\ntrying to get money for. Yeah  but still. If we don't let him\nget to the station. It's not a very big station. No. Okay  he's right in\nthe center of the city. We just have to\nmake sure that we... stay closer to the station\nthan he is. Yeah. If he starts to\nmake his way back. So I think we play it. Oh  look. (giggles) Adam! No  those are mine. Oh  you left those here? Mhm. You dropped them?\nI guess so. These are the ones that I did. Castelfranco's great. Alright  well... about 15 minutes left\nof my veto period. At this point  I really\nonly see one option. Which is... I gotta run it back. I gotta go to Gorizia again. Getting to Gorizia is\npretty cheap  so I actually think I'm\ngonna spend 250 coins finding out where they are. Because I think that's gonna\nhelp inform my decision. Yeah  okay. Alright  we gotta head\nback to the train station. Oh  wait \nhe's moving this way. Okay  okay  okay. We might— 'cause\nthere's two roads back. He might come down this one  or he might come down this one. But there's not a crossover. I think we might want\nto backtrack a bit. Okay  so it cuts through\nto  that's— That's the other road\nhe could take. I don't think he will. I think he's coming this way. I think maybe  one of us\nshould go across the street. Just in case he's on\nthat side of the street. Over there? But just make—\nTake a quick look this way. Make sure he's not there \nand then go that way. Pull up the tracker. Okay  I don't see him. Well  there's... cars. Okay  I'm hiding\nbehind the clock tower on the other side of the street. He's coming down this street. He's on the same side \nso he should pass... right by here. Oh! Gotcha! (cackles) Ahh. Flawless execution. Well  flawless execution except for all of the flaws\nwith our execution. Yeah. Alright. See ya  gentlemen. Damn it! Did my thing work\nthis morning? Did you think I was\non the other train? Did you not see us at all? No. You evaded us twice. Oh  that's awesome. Yeah. Wai— You did what I did! Did I?\nIt was the same thing. Okay  a little bit of mic\ntrouble here to start my run  but now's actually\na good opportunity to talk you through\nmy options. Lucky for me  there's a train about to leave Castelfranco \nheaded for Padua  and there's not another\ntrain to Padua for hours. To get out of here \nBen and Adam will likely have to take a train\nto Venice instead. So I get on my train  but the good news\nreally stops there. I've got two routes\ninto my win area  and neither is great. I could go to Verona \nhead up towards Innsbruck  and then try to turn west. But first off  there are\nno good trains there  and second  if I were to get\ncaught somewhere along the way  we'd likely be in\nAdam's win region  not mine. The more logical option\nis to go west  but that means\ngoing through Milan  a major choke point that's\nnearly impossible to avoid. The trouble is  there are no\ngood trains there from Padua. In fact  given the schedules  I'd likely have to\ngo down to Bologna and then up to Milan  giving Ben and Adam time\nto potentially cut me off. So  what to do? To be honest \nI'm really not loving my options. I think I'm gonna\nhope that there's some advantageous\ndelayed trains... in Padova. And if not... I'm not honestly that sure. We'll see. Yeah. I'm not sure. Alright  well  now it's\nall about Team Ben  I think. Team Ben  Team Ben. Yes  well  Sam is... It's still a\nvery real possibility that we could catch Sam\nin time for you to get a win. I think I'm still in it. The problem is... He has so many coins. And there's a thunderstorm\nhappening now. Ominous. That is not... a good sign. (thunder rumbling)\nBut maybe... Okay  that's not great. We gotta get\nunder some shelter. We just have to hope\nthat this... (rain falling) causes some kind of delay. Well  not really  'cause\nhe's already on a train. Well  some kind of\ndelay that really helps us. (rain pelting umbrella) I hope this isn't an omen. So their restart time... is 10:03. There's a 10:04 to Venice. So I have to imagine they're going to\ndesperately run for that. (rain pelting umbrella) There's a train\nto Venice at 10:04. And we're back in 10:03? Yeah. Eh  we could try it. Alright. Alright  Ben. You ready to run for it? Yeah.\nWe got 20 seconds. Five  four  three  two... Go! Okay  there might be a\nlate train that is worth taking. I'm gonna go look. Because if not \nmy options are not great. Yeah. Tickets. It's a high-speed. So I need to find\nthe ticket office. Well  that probably means\nthat's not happening. There's a wait. You can get in\nthrough the cafe here. How do we get to it?\nIt's this way. Oh no  it's five minutes late \nit's five minutes late. It's five minutes late \nit's on track one. Track one. Track one's here. What's Sam up to? He should have gotten\nin to Padova by now. Yep  he's in the station. Let's see where he goes. Oh  his trains\nare actually pretty bad. Good. Ugh. That train leaves in less\nthan five minutes  I think. But the delays are\nnot precise  so... I don't think I will make this. And then after that  there's really not good\noptions for a little while. Excuse me. You know  is it\npossible to buy a ticket on the late train? Yes.\nTo Milan? Yes.\nOkay. Yeah  you have to buy... the train that's late \nyou have to buy the ticket. Ah  okay.\nBecause I think it's... Yeah.\nOkay  well  I'm on— It means we can not...\nAh  okay. I'll see if I can\ndo it in time  yeah. Thank you. It's the high-speed train.\nYeah. You can pay with card. Uh-huh. You can go on the desk. Oh  really? Here? Do you know if\nI'll make it still? (speaking Italian to agent) Your identity card? Eight minutes. Oh wait. Identity card  passport? Oh  yeah  yeah. If he wants to go to Milan \nhe'll have to wait an hour. Otherwise  he'll have\nto go to Bologna. Well  then— If he goes to Bologna \nhe'll have to go back up. I'm not saying\nhe can't get to Milan. But if he does that \nit'll be expensive  and... We can go to Milan. Okay  so we're off to Venice. We're looking at Sam's options. And we think that if he's\ngoing the Milan route  which we think he is  he's gonna have to go all\nthe way down to Bologna  and then transfer  and then go\nall the way back up to Milan. But when we get into Venice  we can get on a train\ndirectly to Milan. Oh  dude. What?\nWe can beat him to Milan. We can beat him to Milan? Oh  man. I think somehow we can\nactually beat him to Milan. Business class  sir. Alright  thank you. Okay. Oh  oh \nit might just be leaving. Did I make it? Oh  I might have made it. I think I made it. Huge. I did not think\nI was making that. Oh  let's go. That is direct to Milan. Which is directly\nin my direction. High-speed train. Perfect connection. I don't think that\nthey can even get close to arriving in Milan this early. I think we'll be\nhours ahead of them. Salvation. Thank you  Trenitalia. Your delays are so much\nbetter than Deutsche Bahn's. This is awesome. No  he couldn't be on that. Well  no? No  because he was\nin Padua when we left. This train is\nmoving pretty fast. I like that. Well  here's\nthe situation for us. So  we're gonna get\ninto Venice pretty soon. And then  there's\na train that leaves maybe ten minutes\nafter we get in. Probably less than ten  because we're still\na little delayed. Yeah. And it goes\nreally quickly to Milan. So  if we can get on that \nwe could get to Milan faster than he could get to Milan. We actually are in\na pretty good position  but it all relies on\nus being on this train. So in order to get\non this really good train that goes to Verona and Milan... we need to get tickets because\nit requires reservations. And that means we need\nto find a ticket machine  get tickets to get on that train. I think we can do it. I think we can do it  but\nthose machines are slow. The machines are very bad. Alright  you got it \nyou got it. Find a ticket machine. Gotta be one\ndown here somewhere. Yep  there's a machine there. Oh  okay.\nThat's not a machine! Why would they put\na big red box there? That's so misleading! Okay. Just try another machine. Continue. It leaves in one minute. Where is it? I'll find out. Insert your card. Okay. Okay. Track six.\nYou start running. Start running.\nOkay  okay. Start running. Scusi. (bleep) Alright  let's book\non the 11:30. Damn it! We're traveling\nin business class  and they give you\nthe little snack box. Let's do a train\nsnack box mukbang. They have the welcome card  and then they have\na napkin thing. Oh  and more carbohydrates.\nThis is great. I was hoping for more\nbread-adjacent things. I have not had enough\nbread-adjacent things in Italy yet. Okay... Thank you  Trenitalia. Well... Brutal. Yeah  yeah. Doesn't get\nmuch worse than that. Well  fortunately there\nwas a train half an hour later. Yeah  so I guess\nthat would have helped. But...\nI have to loosen this. But  losing a half hour\ncould matter. Here  let's go get\nsomething to eat. Yeah. Here we are on\nthe 11:30 to Milan. We could have been\non that 11  but we missed it\nby just a hair. Here we go. Off to Milan. Welcome to Milan. This is awesome. Okay  I need to look out—\nlook for a train out of here. I'm 99.9% sure that there is no way they\ncould be here by now  because I made a really\nquick connection. But  I'm not that sure how close behind me\nthey could be. So  I need to leave as soon as possible. Welcome back to\nthe Ben and Adam report. He's in Milan  which... I guess what we looked\nat before was wrong  because I did not think he\ncould get there that quickly. No  I'm not sure\nwhat train he took. But it doesn't matter  because what matters\nis that he's in Milan. Yeah  we are not\ngoing to be in Milan ...for another hour and a half. Here's the tough truth. Here's the tough truth. I'm going to give it to you... Give it to you raw. The trains to Switzerland\nare very good. Yeah  it's kind of\ndeeply messed up. They are really fast \nbut they are  for some reason  not classified as high-speed. Which means he can pay\nlow-speed prices for them. Yeah  it's... (bleep)-ed up. I think with his budget  he is gonna be able to\nget well into Switzerland and do that on the fastest\npossible route into Switzerland. And that's... I mean  that means that we won't even have\na chance to catch him until we get to Switzerland. But surely he took—\nHere's the thing though. Surely he took the\nhigh-speed line to Milan. How else could he have\ngotten there so fast? Perhaps. I mean  am I crazy? He got there so fast. You know? Maybe he burned\nthrough more coins than we thought he did. Okay  so... That high-speed train\nwas costly. So I don't have... a tremendous amount\nof budget left. But  I have enough for\nat least this train. Alright  departure board. Venice  no. Napoli  no. Locarno. I know where Locarno is. Switzerland. We are in trouble. We have to hope... that... he doesn't go to Switzerland. Yeah. Or he has less money\nthan we think he does. Or there's... some... benevolent act of God. To stop him in his tracks. Yeah  I mean  we're gonna need a delay or something\nat this point  man. Oh  and there it is \nright there. That's the Swiss Rail operator. This is awesome. Man  the timing on this\nwas just perfect. I had 15–20 minutes\nbetween the trains. Oh  this is going great. You know  this game\nis pretty fun when all the stars align\nright in front of you. I like this game now. Andiamo to Switzerland. Hell yes. What's the Sam status? It's pretty bad... to be honest with you \nBenjamin. What's he doing?\nWell... I believe that he is on\na train right now to Lugano. In Switzerland. Yes. That would not be good. Well  it gets much worse. Oh  okay.\nWhich is that... there's a train that\nleaves to Lugano... two minutes before\nwe get to Milan. Ugh. But once we miss it \nthen we have to wait an hour. Ugh. God. Yeah. That's going to put\nus even further behind. We'll be two hours behind him. (groans) I mean  maybe his train\nwill fall into Lake Como. Lake Como is right there. Wait  are we going to see it? Nope. I promise  it's right there. It's very famous. Where's the lake? Ben... Sam has crossed the\nborder into Switzerland. Well  let's just see how quickly we can do\nthe very same thing. All we need is\na five-minute delay on that train \nand we can make it. A little five-minute delay  because\nwe don't need a reservation. Come on  just a little\nfive-minute delay as a treat. Five-minute delay as a treat? As a little treat? Well  one question is \nis it a Swiss or an Italian train? Because that could\nmake a difference. Yeah  I mean  those Swiss\ntrains are always on time. Yeah  it's a Swiss train. Okay. Look at Switzerland. It's got... mountains. Wall. Train. Alright. Come on  Ben. Look  look  it's still there. Look  look the train at 12:43. It says it's two minutes\ndelayed right now. It's on track six. We're getting in\nthree minutes late now. Yeah  it's pulling in real slow to Milan. But the train—\nTrack six. Track six. It's still— If it shows\non the departure board  that means there's a chance. Yeah. That's it. Track six  Ben.\nTrack six. Where's track six? Which one is this? This is eight. That's six. Yeah  it's... Track six is there \nbut I think it's gone. No. Did it leave? Is there no train\nto Switzerland? I thought it might\nhave been that one  but that's on track five. Track six  it's gone. Ben  it was delayed. It was delayed by two minutes  but our train was\nfive minutes late! Okay  come on. Is there anything? Yeah  no. There's nothing to\nSwitzerland... until  look.\nIt's so long from now that it's the last thing\non the departure board. Welcome to... Cadenazzo  I believe. Google will not tell you on this connection\nto stop here. It'll tell you to go all\nthe way to Lugano. But I was able to figure out that the train\nI want to connect to stops in this random spot too. And therefore  I spend\nless time on trains  and therefore I save coins \nand I need it. I need exactly the number\nof coins I have right now to get to where I want to go. We're back in Switzerland. So we're back to the\ncannabis ice tea. Which I still don't\nreally understand. Well  do you want\nto go show off Milan? Yeah. We have some time.\nLet's go show you Milan while we are here for an hour  because there simply is no way to get into Switzerland\nin that time. Let's go—\nLet's go to the bar. There's a really good bar\nin this train station. I could use a drink. Well  I tried to get one for a Choo Choo Chew\nepisode  but... Alas. Yes. Look at that train.\nLook at that train. I recognize this train. This is the train that\nyou can buy risotto on. Risotto train. This is kind of\nan awesome life hack. If you're ever in the\nMilan train station... This place—\nVisit to the side. There's this wonderful market. So  Milan might not\nhave a train to Switzerland for an hour for\nsome (bleep)-ing reason  but it did have a train to the Snack Zone. Welcome back to\nThe Snack Zone. Today on The Snack Zone \nwe are having liquor. Cheers. I hope Sam's train blows up. See? Wasn't lying. The risotto. What? Alright. Alright  let's\ngo to Switzerland. (whispering)\nIt's not looking good. (wheezes)\nIt's not looking good. I'm just gonna admit that it's\nnot looking so good right now. Oh  it's getting cold. It is getting cold. Okay. I got no more money. I'm outta money. Okay. Shuffling the cards. One last card pull\nof the game. Eat this card. Welcome to Lugano. And to you \nwelcome to Lugano. God  I love Switzerland. Holy moly. Whoa! Look at this place. Ben  this shot is really pretty. So I need you to say\nsomething funny so we can use it. I think I'm gonna lose. (mutters) Oh  it's hard. It's very... Oh! It is not tender. Wait  what was the reward? Oh  no. I ate the part of it that\nsays what the reward was. Ben  Sam has\nstopped moving in Göschenen. Does that sound familiar? Rings a bell. Yeah  I think—\nI think we might know where he's going at this point. Oh  I've gotta eat fast. I'm just gonna\n(bleep) up my stomach. I'm gonna be fine.\nGame's almost over. There. Done. Let's go.\nLet's go. Does anyone recognize this? Come on  you must.\nCome on. If he is going there  we need to get on\na train in... 13 minutes. So we should go back\nto the station. Alright. Okay. Oh  it is— It's— Ohh  it's cold. Thank you. So  thank you. Ooh  that's better. One last train. This one's just for\nthe lols  kind of. I don't think we need it. Well  Ben... He has stopped moving. Is he where we think he is? Yep. (sighs) Guess we'll see him there. It's gonna take us\nso long to get there. And Ben  it's so cold there. We gotta do what\nwe gotta do  Adam. We are the Chasers  and we will chase to\nthe very last minute. ♪ It's chilly ♪ Track 11. Almost there. Almost there. It's nice to be back. Are you excited  Ben? Because it's time to play\nmy favorite game. What's your\nfavorite game  Adam? It's called put all my\nshirts on at the same time because it's so cold outside\nand I didn't pack for this. I thought you were\ngoing to say hide and seek. No. Seven  eight  nine shirts. Well  if that\ndoesn't keep you warm  I don't know what will. Alright  let's get ready. Okay. Well  welcome. Or should we say \nwelcome back. Yes  it would seem that... at least according\nto the tracker... Sam has posted up in\na familiar landmark. Familiar to those\nof you who watched season 9 of\nJet Lag: The Game. If the tracker\nis to be believed... Sam... is in that castle... right there. Let's go get him. There they are. Coming in hot. Well  not really actually \nbut that's fine. (snickers)\nI think that's Sam. There he is. Well... Let's go get him. (laughs) Do you remember\nhow to get up there? Okay. Alright  Sam. I think he's gonna\nmake us go up. We got you now. In a moment. We're gonna getcha. Almost there. I hope you're worried. (indistinct) Oh  god. One more flight of steps. Yeah. (distant bell ringing) Only one more. We got you. Hello  Ben. Hello  Adam.\nYou're trapped now. (wheezes)\nThere's no way out now. There's no way out. (exhaustedly)\nI can't do it. I'm gonna get you. Tag.\nGot you. Well  Ben... you've got 58 minutes to\nget back to your win region. Fellas... I didn't study\nmath in school  but... I did the numbers and... I'm pretty sure I cannot\nmake it back to Italy before the end of the game  so... Sam... I believe that means\nthat you win. Well done  Sam.\nYaaay! You have done it. Another good round of tag. Well done. And congratulations on\nyour first solo Jet Lag win. Thank you.\nYes. Appreciate it. Now... Should we... turn around? Yeah  let's turn around. Now  Sam \nyou might be wondering  where's the trophy? Well  don't worry. We thought of that. We've been traveling with\nthe trophy the whole time. Ben got some very\nexpensive procedures done. Yes  very experimental. Mind you  this is\nvery experimental. Wait  who paid for those? So fellas  back up  okay? Here... we go! I'm transforming. Whoa!\nOh my god. That's crazy! I didn't know\nyou could do that  Ben. Now... Sam... Ben turned into the trophy! Is this FDA approved? No! Ugh. You hold him up.\nOh yeah. Ben trophy. I'm gonna cherish this\nfor my... Wait  I need Ben to write videos. I can't put the trophy\non my wall if he's... Well  he can turn back. I transform back! And do you want him\nto transform back now? Sure  let me just—\nCan you scooch? Yeah. Yeah  yeah. I mean  you can scooch. Oh  that was so painful! It crunched all my organs! You're all crunched up now! I'm all crunched up now! Sam  you've been on\nso many trains. So many trains.\nFor so long. Crossing borders.\nOh my god. And in this moment  I guess\nI really just want to know... How are you feeling? (wincing) Oh my god.\nI mean  I could... I could go on and on\nand think about how I'm feeling. Sure  yeah. There's a lot of things\nabout how I'm feeling. But I guess if I were to\ntry to do it succinctly  because I do think that\nengagement matters. You summed it up. Yeah  if I were to sum it up  I guess I would say\nI'm feeling... ...jet lagged! Whoaaa!\nYeah! Let's go!\nWe can't run  it's too slippery! (shrieks)\nWohohoho! Good bye!\nGood bye! See you in season 12!\nAah  my organs! See you in season 12! Ben  are you okay? Yeah  I'll be fine. Alright. Alright! Okay. Here  let's set up\na nice little shot. And we both sit there \nand we face the camera. I like this shot. Alright  let's hurry up. Yeah  that's nice. Thank you so much for watching yet another season\nof Jet Lag: The Game. Hopefully you found it fun? I found it fun.\nI found it fun. I found it especially fun \nespecially the end. But anyways  if you want\nto hear more of my opinions on that ending and... your... y'all's opinions on that ending... Mhm. You should listen\nto the Layover podcast. This is a podcast that we make\nevery single week in-season  basically acting as the companion\nto the show you see here. So everything  you know \nthis is highly edited down. Everything that we\ncan't show in the show  we talk about on The Layover. And there's a lot. There's always a lot\nof strategy to explain. A lot of mistakes to explain \na lot of BTS to talk about. And then  you know \nit's also a good way to stay in touch with the show\nduring the off-season. Because we sometimes\nplay some games  we do some BTS of\nthe upcoming season. More than 10 000 people\nlisten every week. So  you know. Pretty good numbers. But another thing to keep you\noccupied during the off-season is we made a whole other show \ncalled The Getaway. We've talked about it\na little bit  but basically  we did this big  real reality show where we had\nall these other creators  and we were driving them\nacross the whole American West  and they were doing\nall these challenges. And they thought that there was one traitor who was\nstealing from them  but it turned out that\nthey were all the traitor. It was really funny.\nIt was very experimental. It was our first time\ndoing anything like that. And we wouldn't have been able\nto do anything remotely like that without your support on Nebula. Yeah  it's worth saying \nboth The Layover and The Getaway: Nebula-exclusive  Nebula Originals.\nOnly on Nebula. And Nebula  sort of... A big thing that they do is  in addition to a lot of\nYouTube creators that you know putting their stuff up on Nebula  often early  ad-free \nsometimes extended... is that they will give\ncreators a big budget to do sort of\ndream projects for them that they would not be\nable to do on YouTube. Our dream project was\ngaslighting a bunch of our friends. That's true \nand we got to do it  and it was really fun \nand we had a whole crew. Yeah.\nYou know  a crew of 25  real cameras and\nlighting and everything. And they've done that\nfor other creators. Jessie Gender created a\nshort film  Identiteaze  that was sort of\nher dream project. Abigail Thorn from\nPhilosophy Tube has a short film out \nDracula's Ex-Girlfriend  that was sort of a\ndream project for her. Patrick Willems made a movie \nNight of the Coconut  sort of a dream project\nfor him. Tom Nicholas is making a\ndocumentary called Boomers. And these are all  you know \nthese really cool  exciting projects that are only made\npossible by your support  by subscribing to Nebula. Yeah  I'm really\nlooking forward to Boomers  because it's about\nthe \"geritocracy\". Yeah. Which is a new word\nthat I've learned. Yeah  I think\nit's the gerontocracy. Yeah  something like that.\nYeah. Yeah  anyway. But it's about why\nAmerican politics has been kind of taken over by people\nwho are 80-something years old. By the Boomers.\nBy the Boomers. Yeah.\nYeah  but it's looking good. Anyways  Nebula \nworth signing up for  IMO. So go to nebula.tv/jetlag\nto sign up. Thanks for watching this season. Bye?\nBye! I love you.\nSee you in season 12. (shudders) Yeah. A lot of seasons. Like a dozen  wow.\nI know. Jeez. Bye. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus"

        "transcript": "Welcome to Australia. The world's 6th largest country\nand the 3 million square mile board for our game about\ntravel  money  and risk. We're here in Sydney  Australia \nand we've got $1 000 each. Over the next four days  we're gonna be spending it \ngambling it  and stealing it as we race across the country\ntrying to claim the most regions. But right now  it's 7:30 am. So we gotta go  go  go! Alright  let's go!\nAlright  Ben. Let's check the\nNew South Wales challenges. Let's go  Toby! Eeee!\nWe're back! Alright  so this is a game\nall about travel and money. The overall goal is simple:\nat the end of four days  the team that controls more of\nAustralia's eight regions wins. Those regions are\nthe country's six states: Queensland \nNew South Wales  Victoria  Tasmania  South Australia \nand Western Australia; and its two internal territories: the Northern Territory and the\nAustralian Capital Territory. In order to take control\nof a region  a team must be\nphysically in the region  and then must deposit money into\nthe region from their budget. As little as one dollar can\ngive them control of the region  but there's a good reason\nto deposit much more. If their opponents show up\nlater in the game and put down a higher deposit \nthey'll steal control. There's no limit on\nhow often teams can deposit  so regions can change hands a number of times\nthroughout the game. But teams will need to be\nsmart with their money  because that same money\nwill be used to pay for their travel between regions. The more teams spend\non flights  the less they'll have to deposit. The good news is  teams can\nmake money by doing challenges. That's why both teams are\nrunning to the Opera House. That's where New South Wales's\nChallenge Board is. Alright  so the first thing\nwe have to decide... Do we want to try to\ndo some challenges and make some money \nor do we want to— —use our money\nand kind of like— I think  let's go check out\nwhat the challenges are for today. Yeah  we at least\nwant to know what it is. So we got to go to the—\n—top of the Opera House and see what we can do. Yeah  the Challenge Board\nis at the top of the Opera House. Isn't it gawrgeous here? Alright  let's get to the steps. Where are they? Oh  there they are. Alright  the\nChallenge Board is here. Adam  what's on there? (Ben and Adam breathe heavily) Look at those slowpokes. Alright  here we go \ntoday's challenges. Okay  wait a minute. Before we show\nthe day's challenges  let's talk about how\nthese challenges work. You see  it's not as simple as\n\"do a challenge  win a prize.\" Each challenge is a gamble...\nliterally. Before starting a challenge  teams will choose\nhow much of their budget to wager on the challenge. If they successfully complete it \nthe money they wagered will be compounded by\nthat challenge's multiplier: 2x  3x  even 4x. That means that with a big wager  teams could exponentially\nincrease their budget. But if they fail the challenge  all the money they wagered\nwill be gone. Alright  now let's\ncheck out what challenges are available today\nin New South Wales. Alright. Make a rock carving\nat the indigenous rock engravings. Score an Australian football\ngoal in Redfern. Win a carnival game\nat Luna Park. And taste test Australian foods  which is this challenge\nwhere you have to eat a bunch of Australian snacks\nat the same time and figure out\nwhich ones they are. Trying to see if I can\nget us any useful intel. There's some\ngood ones on there. Here comes the reaction.\nOkay  yeah  so... I guess maybe we should\ndo the multipliers. They're just watching us. (Sam and Toby laugh)\nThey didn't even notice us! Hello! Hey guys  nice to see you. Come over here. I don't want them listening\nto what we're gonna do. What? Did you see that? So we've got\na 2.5  a 2  a 3  and a 1.5. We could do one of these. Or we could just straight up leave.\nOr we could leave. Let's look at the flights first. Alright  last rules thing. You might be wondering  why would a team want\nto leave so soon? Well  the first team\nto get to a new region receives a $750 welcome bonus. That's valuable  guaranteed money. So  at this early stage of the game \nthe real question is: should teams stick around\nand do challenges  or leave to claim a welcome bonus? Here's the thing to keep in mind. We only get the welcome bonuses\nif we're first to another region. And they usually are more than\nthe cost to get to a region. And not only do\nwe want welcome bonuses  we want them to\nnot get welcome bonuses. That is true.\nI'm happy to do  either fly to Melbourne now \nor do an easy challenge. Both of which I think are... both good options for us. Question is if there's\na good cheap flight. Yeah. There's a really cheap\none to Brisbane though. Ooh  there's a really\ncheap one to Brisbane. Here's the thing \nI don't like being in the same region as them\ntrying to do challenges  because there's only\nfour challenges for today. And if they were to do one \nthen there'd be even fewer options. It's true  and we don't know\nwhat they might be doing. And so if they scoop it\nwhile we're trying it  that's just wasted time. This game is really hard \nby the way. This is something\nyou're gonna see over the next few days. This game is very hard. It's incredibly hard. So there's a\npretty cheap flight to Melbourne at 9:25 am. So we might have the time to\ndo a challenge before then. Okay  here's what\nI think we should do. I think we... Let's head to the airport \nbut let's don't book the flight yet  in case they head to the airport. So that we can\nswitch gears if we need to. I agree. Okay. Let's go. Should we see\nwhere they're going? I think  well  we want to\ngo that way regardless. We want to take a flight—\nTo be honest  I think actually we\nshould do the challenges. Because this game is a bit\nlike investing in returns  in the sense that we need\nmore money up front to get more money as we go. Okay  so if we were\nto do a challenge now  we would do the food one? Yeah  I think that's probably\nthe easiest to do right here. Okay. Pretty high chance that\nthat's what they're doing too. As we're heading\ntowards the train  we also found another really good flight\nto Hobart  Tasmania. Flights to Hobart\nare not super common  so that could be a good get for us. (sighs) Yeah.\nIs it cheap? It's super cheap. It's $258. That could be\npretty big for us. But my worry is that\nthey're gonna figure that out. I think we should\ngo to the airport and try to see if they're doing it. Yeah  let's just\nget to the airport. So  we're trying to\ngo to a convenience store? I think so.\nBefore we go in  we have to decide\nhow much we want to stake. Oh  oh  yeah. The multiplier is 1.5. Okay  let me do\na little calculation. Before Toby and I\nmake our wager  let's quickly explain\nthis challenge. We have to buy five\niconic Australian foods and then feed them in one bite to your blindfolded partner  who must then identify\nwhich three foods they ate. What probability of success\ndo you think we have? I feel relatively\noptimistic about success. Are you confident? I think I could do it. How— How could you\nmess this up? Although it's all in one bite. I don't know.\nYeah  all in one bite. But you can't say \"how could\nwe mess this up\"  Toby. 'Cause then we always cut\nto directly us messing it up. How could we\npossibly mess this up? It's recommending we bet\n25% of our wealth  $250. Really? That does\nseem low to me. How about\nmeet in the middle  $300? Okay.\n$300  lock it in. Oh  there. Sirena tuna. Tim Tams. Vegemite. (indistinct) I was about to leave. Goodness me  we've made it. I don't know what\nBen and Adam are doing. We gotta go quick\nin case they're trying this too. Okay. Intercity and regional\nNew South Wales services and live rail services. You ever watch that video of the kangaroo putting\nthe dog in a chokehold? No.\nAnd you can see its big bi— It's crazy. This is a thing that\nkangaroos just do. Why would a kangaroo do that? They— I don't— 'Cause they've got\nthose big biceps. No  I know that\nthey can do it  but why? They hate dogs. I have to feed you\nall three in one bite after you're blindfolded. I'm generating\nthe numbers  Toby. The first one is... The second one is... Third one is... Working on it  Toby. Uughh! Mmmhmh. Okay  Toby  eyes closed. You just have to eat that  and you're not— eyes closed! My eyes are closed! I mean  look  the best case\nscenario for us here is that they attempt a challenge  they take a long time\nsetting it up  and then they fail it. Yeah. 'Cause here's the thing\nabout challenges. And this is really\nimportant to emphasize. It's not always good\nto do a challenge. No. Because you might lose money.\nYeah. One bite  everyone\nknows the rules. (shudders) It's an interesting flavor \nisn't it? (wheezes) You look concerned. (full mouth)\nI don't know. I don't— I don't know. Mmh. (mouth clearing)\nMh  okay. Caramello Koala. That's one. Tuna. That's two. Vegemite. Yes  Toby  let's go! There we go. The Vegemite was the one\nthat got overpowered by tuna. Yeah  that makes sense. Because it just all tasted\nlike tuna on chocolate. Right. Oh  that's such\na good start. Okay. Okay  well  so\nthey did the taste test. Okay  looks like they bet $300 \nand they succeeded. They made $150.\nThey made $150. $150 profit. I mean  that's not—\nI'm gonna be honest. That's not moving\nthe needle very much. No  that doesn't do a lot. If I were them \nI would've bet more. That doesn't worry me. It's hardly worth your time. As Shania Twain once said \nthat don't impress me much. No  that don't\nimpress me much. That don't impress me much. That... don't impress me much. Time to transfer. I've never seen\na flight this cheap to Tasmania from Sydney\nin any of the... game simulations\nwe did before this. It must just be so last minute\nand basically empty. Yeah. Let's just take advantage. Pricing error? There's been a pricing error. You click on it. Pricing error. Let's just ask. Let's ask at the airport. (sighs) Okay. It's not good. No  it's not great. Okay  let's look\nat the challenges. The challenges left are\nthe AFL goal in Redfern. I don't think we want to do that.\nNo. Luna Park isn't open until 10.\nOkay. So that only leaves\nthe rock carvings. Let's do the rock carving. This spot  where this is \nis so scenic. Should we head to Bondi Junction\nAlright  let's go. And then we'll\nhave to get on a bus. Trains! This is so exciting. Okay. Are we on the right train? Probably. Alright  okay. Welcome to the airport. Seemingly  there are some\ndiscrepancies with flight prices. So we're gonna go— Okay  wait  but now it's back. Now it says it should be $319. Look  we're just—\nLet's go in person and see what the\ncheapest  earliest flight we can get to\nsomewhere else is. Things always go better\nwhen you ask in person. Sometimes. Can I help you? Yes  hi. We were trying to book\non the 10 am to Hobart. And on Google  it said that\nit had some really cheap fares. But then when we tried to\nbook it  it wasn't working. I know sometimes it shows 'booking through a\nthird party'  but it doesn't. It shows on there \n'booking through Virgin'. Which is strange. Yeah  it's weird  isn't it? Wow  thank you so much.\nThank you so much. Oh  that could be big for us. Yeah  of course. Let's see  where are they? They're going to the rocks. Alright  so I think\nwe need to look for a grocery store or something where we could get\nscissors or a knife. Make a rock engraving at the\nindigenous rock engravings. Visit the indigenous rock\nengravings by North Bondi. Generate a random animal\nfrom the list provided and carve it into a rock\nthat no one cares about. The other team member must guess the animal\ncorrectly on their first try. Before we buy anything  we need to decide\nhow much we're staking. How are you feeling\non your riskiness scaled? I think it's not too bad\nto be risky now. I guess that's true \nbecause now is the time we have to come back\nfrom failure. Yeah  but how are you\nfeeling about your carving ability? If you're feeling good \nI'll go $500. I'm not good about\nmy arts and crafts. If you're feeling very unsure \nI'd go $400. I'd— I'm comfortable\nwith $400. Mitre 10's got our back. Oh yeah  they'll have some. Let's go get the bus. Love a good articulated bus. There you go.\nAll done  guys. Thank you so much. Wow.\nBless your heart. Thank you  Marissa. Thank you.\nThat's alright. Enjoy. Hehehe-eee!\n(paper flapping) Alright  let's get\non our flight. Wheee! (blubbers) And while\nyou're on your phone  give us an update on\nBen and Adam. So they spent... $288. So it sounds like\nthey got $144 each? Where could they be\ngoing for that cheap? Hello  how's it going?\nHello. Ben  we've done it. We've done it. Welcome to Bondi. Welcome to Bondi Beach. I feel like this is one of\nthe most quintessentially— Where are you going?\nYou're walking in the middle of the road. Okay. So we are looking for the\nindigenous rock carvings  which should be\nright on the coast here. This is... the Atlantic Ocean. Oh... The things. It is— Those are— From the oldest\nculture in the world. They are properly carved.\nThat's what I'll say. Definitely. I'm surprised how deep it is. But now we need\nto do our own. Can we clarify\nwe ain't carving this? No  we are not carving\ninto the ancient rock carvings. We are finding a loose rock. And then we are carving. Make sure you get\nthe best rock. This one's decent. This is a brick. Ooh. It's a pretty—\nYeah  no  I like that. That's a canvas. Alright. Toby?\nYes? I think it's time. I'll go for a walk. See ya. Alright  what animal\nwe get is crucial to whether or not\nthis is gonna be easy. 13. Okay  let's see. 8  9  10  11  12  13. Yes  okay. That's gotta be easy. Let's see how this works. (metal-on-rock scraping) Alright  Ben  it looks like\nthey are at the rock carvings. Yeah  I mean \nwe just have to hope that they're not\nvery good at drawing. I think there's a good chance\nthey could fail that one. That would rock if they did. That would—\nHey  that would rock. Heyyy! (scraping continues) (blows hard) I don't know\nwhat more I can do. I'm trying not to\noverthink this  but... I think this is it. Okay. Hopefully you can see that. That's pretty clear. I think we're ready. Toby?\nYeah? I know that might\nseem quick  but I'm ready. Oh dear. (mutters hesitantly) Something comes to mind. Something definitely\ncomes to mind. No  we've got to go for... giraffe. Lock it in. Congratulations  Toby. You're now the proud\nowner of 600 new dollars. Success. I like it.\nYou did really well. Thank you.\nAnd that took no time at all. Then let's go.\nWe're cruising. We'll leave this here\nfor the next person. Let's return it\nto our natural habitat. And then let's figure out\nour next move. We could actually go\nto Luna Park  by the way. Yeah  no \nit's worth considering. It's in the city center \nso once we're there... it's not much of\na waste of time to go ahead and do it.\nMhm. Let's walk and talk. Let's make moves\ntowards Luna Park. Yeah  let's go back\ntowards the city. Yeah. Hi  to Bondi Junction? Bye  Bondi. Interesting. Interesting  interesting. It kind of looks like they\nmight be on a flight... to Hobart. Sydney to Hobart? Well  to be honest  if there was a crazy\ngood deal to Hobart... Mhm. It would make sense.\nYeah. Hobart would be\na big play. It's a surprising opening move. How do you feel\nabout carnival games? I don't have\na good track record of hand-eye coordination\nchallenges. In fact  what Ben and Adam\ncould put right here is a supercut of me trying to\nknock an apple off of Ben's head. Oh no! Oh  that— Noooo— Oh  it— (grimaces) Auunngh! Luna Park. We actually go—\nWe go down here. We don't go\nthrough the massive sign that says 'Luna Park'? Do you know about the\nhorrors of Sydn— Luna Park? I feel like the\nhorrors of Luna Park is about— is what's\nabout to happen. Man  that's quite an\niconic view. Wait! Alright  Toby  do you have\nthe challenge list? I was just gonna pull it up. Win a carnival game\nat Luna Park. You have $20 worth of\nattempts to win a prize at any of the carnival games\nthat only have one prize tier: buckets  backboard \nbasketball  or cans. There's buckets.\nWhat was— Buckets  backboard \nbasketball  cans. I'm pretty sure\nthis is buckets. Okay  okay  okay. (sighs) Alright  well we\nbought the in-flight Wi-Fi  so we know that they\nare at Luna Park. Those games are—\nThey're hard. They're designed\nfor you to lose. They're hard. I think the carnies are gonna\ntake their money and run. Should I ask him what the\nchances are of winning buckets? (indistinct) No  we were wondering\nhow likely it is to win a prize. On a scale of\none to ten  it's a six. A six out of ten?\nI don't lie. Are you easier than backboard? If you can win this \nyou can win this. Basketball? There is basketball \nbut you cannot win it. It's the hardest game.\nIt's the hardest game? Okay. I'd say we give this a shot. We should give this a shot. Yeah.\nYeah. We get $20 worth. Yeah  which is five.\nWhich is five games  yeah. Okay—\nSeven games. (indistinct) Oh  thank you. Yes  thank you.\nOkay. We have to put— We had to lock in our wage. Oh  yeah  yeah.\nWhat do you want to wager? $1 000? $750? Do you want to go that much? Let's say  okay  $500. $500.\n$500. I wanna do more. $500. Okay  $500?\nOkay. (sighs) They've put down\n$500 on that contract. This I think is a\npretty important moment. If they blow it... Then they'll have lost\na lot of their progress. They'll be almost\nback to where they started. But if they hit... They'll have a lot of cash. We'll see. We'll see.\nWe'll see. And then put\nthe balls in the basket. Okay. Just make sure you\ndon't cross the line  okay? Try not to hit the back  okay? Because if you hit the back... Yeah.\nIt will come out. I feel like I— Yeah \nI have to be gentle  right? Yes.\nOkay. And the thing is \nif you want to win... try hitting the rims of the basket. The rims  okay. This is the spot. Ahp— I wanted to be—\nIt's okay  practice shot. I was trying to be too gentle. (silly grumbles) Sam?\nDo you wanna give it a shot? Okay  okay \nI'll give it a shot. (grunts) Mmh.\nYou have to— You want me to try again? Go insanely gentle\nand then make it gentler. That's number one down.\nOnly one more. Yes  yes  yes  yes \nyes  yes  yes  yes. Even gentler.\n(giggles nervously) (both grunt)\nOkay  that was close. I feel good about\nthe technique though. What was that?\nThat was four? Yes. So three more. You've done it once  right? Reproduce that. Oh man. So wait  two more times? Yes. Wait  I can give you\na better one. Better basket? That's number one.\nYes! Okay  one more  yeah. Do the same thing again. Ohh! Alright  last one. (grumbles) Oh  man. Okay. He was so friendly! I got my hopes up.\nHe was. I think he felt bad.\nHe gave us extras. Yikes! It's fine. It's fine. That's— That's— It's fine. Ben  they've left Luna Park ...and they're still $-500. I think that they—\nI think that they blew it. Look  they flew a\nlittle too close to the sun. And by the sun  I mean the... The carny games at Luna Park.\nCarny games at Luna Park. They flew too close\nto those and they lost. I wonder which one they did. I bet they did the thing where\nyou throw the thing in the bucket. It looks really easy. It looks easy. That's how they\nmake all their money. That's true. That's gotta hoit.\nThat's gotta hoit! Sorry. Ooh. (grimaces) No  okay  okay. Moving on.\nWe're moving on. We don't want to do AFL. So the only question now is... where do we go? So there's not really a\ngreat Melbourne option. Yeah  honestly \nMelbourne flights are expensive. Adelaide  kinda similar deal. We could go to Gold Coast\nfor really cheap. There's cheap flights to Gold Coast at pretty much any time.\nOkay. I'd like to do that\nif they haven't gone there. I think Gold Coast is\na good place to be. Alright  we have\n10 minutes until the next ferry. So we got a quick snack. I wanted to talk to you\nabout an edge case. We're going to Gold Coast.\nYeah  this is interesting. The Gold Coast Airport appears to be pretty much\non the border between Queensland\nand New South Wales. Are you aware of this? I am now. And you can claim\nregions in this game by being anywhere \nI believe  in the state  yes? Yeah. Would it be good to\nkeep that in our pocket as an idea  if at\nthe end of the game  we wanted to end at  say \nthe Gold Coast Airport and quickly toggle between\nNew South Wales and Queensland? Yeah. Go have a look on the map. Oh yeah  the border goes It's literally on the border.\nthrough the runway. Yeah  it's a good thought. I don't know if they know that. It never came up in game design. Mhm. So that could be\nan interesting strat. That could be an exploit.\nYeah. This park may have\nstolen $500 from me. Well  not stolen  but... took away $500 from me. This pretzel. This pretzel is pretty... you know \nas the kids say  Toby  GOATed with the sauce. What? This is transport mode\nnumber four of the day. It's pretty good. You count feet  and we're\nabout to hit number five. Three minutes  we're fine. Let's see if they've... gotten back down to land yet. Ohh— Look at that.\nOne minute. Oh my god! Hobart International Airport. Oh my god. Why are they doing that? Welcome to Hobart. Welcome to Hobart. Welcome to Hobart.\nWe've made it. We've made it to... Tassie. That's what we learned... We learned it's called Tassie.\nis what we can call it. Let's update our budget\nwith the welcome bonus. Is that the SkyBus?\nIt could be. Where do we think\nthe SkyBus goes? Where does the bus go?\nWhere does it end? End of the city.\nWhere are you going to? We're going to the Cenotaph. Cenotaph?\nYeah. Stop one  and there's just\na short walk up to the Cenotaph. Fantastic.\nPerfect. Perfect. We're saving money\nand we're saving the planet. This is great news. Look  you know \nas far as I'm concerned  10 out of 10\npublic transit in Hobart. So far \neverything's gone great. Have fun at Hobart  guys. Melbourne is wide open. Yep. I like Melbourne \nbut you know  Gold Coast  also wide open. Very cheap flight.\nHappy to go for either. Let's go with the soonest flight. Which is Gold Coast. Okay.\nOkay. Okay  based on how\nexpensive their flight was  they're on the 1:20\nto the Gold Coast. That's good news for us. Yeah  because it means that whether we go to Melbourne\nor Adelaide after this  they probably won't\nbe there either way. Yeah. I mean  that means that\nwe can kind of like... hopefully dominate\nthe south of Australia and really lock those regions in. That would be really good for us. Certainly would be good. Look at this! I mean  I'm charmed\nby this whole place  even though the couple of facts that the guy gave us\non the bus were that the bridge\ncollapsed and killed everyone  and that a woman is\nin charge  and... He seemed to be\ndissatisfied with that. It's true. Yeah  they were not\ngood fun facts  but this is a fun town. There's the Cenotaph. What is a cenotaph? I have no idea\nwhat a cenotaph is. I love cenotaphs. I hope it's not\na (bleep)-ed up thing. Yeah  that'd be bad. Welcome to the Cenotaph. Now we can check\nthe Challenge Board. Adam  I am in the\nright emotional headspace to receive this information. Alright  challenge one. Read signal flags at\nMount Nelson Signal Station. Okay.\nSo we'd have to go there  make signal flags  and signal\na word to the other one. Okay  okay. That's a 2x. Create a traditional\nTasmanian kelp basket. That's a 2x.\nOkay. (snickers)\nThrow shrimp on the Barbie. We have 100 tries to\nthrow shrimp onto a Barbie doll from\na distance of 30 feet. (chuckles) It's risky. And \"That's not a knife\". You have to cut a\nTim Tam in half longways with something\nthat is not a knife. A great reference to... Crocodile Dundee.\nCrocodile Dundee. That's a 2x  okay. So we've got\nthree 2x's and one 3x. Well  here's\nwhat I'll say  in general. Here's the thing about Tassie. The great state of Tassie. I – and this is not a\nslight to this place – but I do not wanna\nhave to come back here. No  and I don't want\nthem to come here at all. So  I think\nthat before we leave  we want to put down\nan amount of money that is gonna deter them\nfrom ever coming here. So we can just lock it up. Because it's not easy\nto get here  and it would be hard\nif we had to come back. Yes. I think the only\nquestion left is... how much do we want to\nleave in New South Wales? I think we think that\nif we ever want to win this  we're probably going\nto have to be back. I don't think\nwe can lock it up. I would only do $250. Mmh... I feel more like $500 or so. Even if we think we're\ngoing to have to come back... We'll be back\nfor sure to Sydney. In an ideal version of this game  we would have $5 000\non the last day or more. And we would book\nflights to four cities. Four to five cities. Well  we couldn't\nmake that much. We couldn't travel\nthat much then anyway. It's possible  I think. Maybe a super optimized route. Yeah.\nWe could do three. Oh  we could do at least\nfour cities on one day. Let's say we put \nyou know  $375 or $400. Then I think we still have so much to play with\nin Queensland. Yeah  that sounds good to me. We can do $400. $400? Lock it in? Yeah. You want to press the button? It's right there.\nThis button. Actually  I don't know\nif we can afford buttons. I don't know. I don't want to commit to that. We'll press the\nmetaphorical button Okay.\nto lock it in. Good?\nYep. Any other words for the camera? So  shrimp on the\nBarbie is definitely not safe. No  that feels\nvery risky to me. I think the Tim Tam\nis also not safe at all. I think... signal station.\nI feel like we could do that. As long as we\nput in enough time that we are able to\nmake the flags good. Right. How much do we want to bet? (exhales sharply) Here's what I think  Ben. I think we should\nbet the exact amount that would leave us enough that we could get a\nflight out of here if we were to fail. That... That would say\nwe should bet $855. You want to round down\nand bet $800? Okay. I think $800. Put down $800. (imitates slot machine pulley) Read signal flags at\nMount Nelson Signal Station. At the historic\nMount Nelson Signal Station  one team member must\ncreate and use signal flags to spell a random 10 letter word  which the other team member\nmust decode from a distance of 100 feet. Team members may not speak\nto each other when signaling  and the signaling may not\nlast more than 100 seconds. The decoder has one guess. Ugghh  if we fail this \nthen it's gonna really suck. It's gonna put us\nin a really bad position. That's fine. Let's find a store \nlike a general store. First flight of the game. For us at least. Yep. Welcome... to Officeworks. Whee! Yes  they've got... plenty of stuff. I'm gonna leave  you do this. Now that Adam\nhas left the premises  I can confide in you\nwhat my word is. My word is 'cohabitant'. And we can spell that out\non screen with the flags. And so  I just need\nto be able to make... those eight letters. Let's go. Wow. What a view. Welcome to the\nMount Nelson Signal Station  where they used to do... signals.\nWhat is  so tell— What is the history\nof this place  Ben? I believe that they would\njust signal ships with flags. You can see the flags there. Oh  I see. Lovely. From all the way up here. I'm gonna go there\nand make the flags  and you've gotta just go away. Okay. So... We need all of our letters. If we fail this... we are in deep  deep trouble. It's like the flag of... Poland? I wonder how Poland\nfeels about that. Or maybe this isn't\nthe flag of Poland. What is the flag of Poland? Comment below... about what the flag of Poland is. Okay  let's go get Adam. Adam! Camera  I'm gonna\nhand you over to Adam. Alright  we're going. Alright. Alright  that very clearly\nseems to be a C. That's an O. H. A. B. I. That's a T. A. N. T. Ben... Was the word 'cohabitant'? Yes. Yeah! Okay  so  it's 2:30. There's a flight that we\nwant to get on at 6:30. The 6:30 to Adelaide? I mean  I continue to\nreally like that flight. I mean  I'm of— I'm of half a mind to\njust go ahead and book it. I think priority—\nI don't see a situation where we don't want\nto take that flight. I mean  the only situation\nwould be if they went to Adelaide  which wouldn't make any sense.\nActually  we should check on them. There's a bus\nleaving in one minute. That is gonna make\na 30-minute difference  but I don't think we'll get to it. No  no  that's the one. That was it. Yeah. Wonder if they... Damn it. Yep  found it. Damn it. Well... we went as fast as we could. Well  on the plus side... I think there's some devastating\nnews from Ben and Adam  which is that I changed the budget. That's not the plus side. Ben  we are\nbooked to Adelaide. Alright  you know \nthree regions on day one? That's not bad. It's not bad at all. We still have to earn some\nmore money before we leave  because I think\nwe want to put down as much as we can here. I mean  the one that\nreally kind of calls to me is the Barbie one. I just  it's a 3x. 3x  yeah.\nYou get 100 tries. But it's 3x  'cause it's risky. How far is 30 feet? I'm gonna measure. You go be the Barbie. A hundred tries? A hundred? Okay. Holy (bleep) There's a wallaby\ndown there. (whispering)\nOh  yeah  yeah. Oh  that is a wallaby  Ben. (whispering)\nThat's totally a wallaby. Yeah  yeah  come on. (room volume)\nIt's just a little guy. Shhh. (whispering)\nIt's just a sweet little guy. Hello  little guy. Hello. He's looking right at us  Ben. (squeakily)\nLook at that guy. (whispering)\nOh  there he goes. (softly)\nLook at it hop. That was awesome. That was awesome\nwhat just happened. Bad news. Eh  ah... What are their names?\nBen and Adam seemingly completed the\nchallenge successfully and wagered quite a lot on it. So they are up for claim... They're up. They're up.\nTerrible news. Good news...\nGood news  weather. The weather's nice.\nVery nice day. The weather is nice.\nGood news to us. Bad news...? Bad news? Climate change. Good news...? Global child poverty\nis at a near historic low. That's great news. Bad news...? I guess it's\nonly good news then. So I imagine  Toby  it has crossed your mind\nthat this season is all about... evaluating risk. Which is kind of exactly\nwhat won us last season. I hate to say it  but... I do think there are\nsome common themes there in the sense that... Adam and Ben\nmight think things are easier than they really are.\nYeah. They are often \nI think  overconfident. I just feel like with\n100 tries  with 100 tries  surely you could land\na shrimp on the Barbie. Regardless \nif we're gonna do it  we gotta do it soon. (sighs heavily) I think... put in $800... and we do it right now. Alright  alright. Here we go. (pew) $800 in shrimp on a Barbie. Okay  there's a Target nearby\nthat should have Barbies. I don't know if it'll have shrimp. Target. Alright  lots of Barbies. We just want the Barbie\nwith the most volume. This Barbie—\nThat's a solid Barbie. It's a big dress that\nthe shrimp could get caught in. Right  right. I like that. I think we need the\nA Touch of Magic Barbie. Absolutely. Now the question is  how large of a shrimp\ncan you find? Alright  Adam \nkeep your eyes peeled for the biggest shrimp\nyou've ever seen. Oh  baby! (laughs) I mean  these shrimp\nare pretty big. And they've got\nlots of legs and stuff. Thank you.\nThank you. Okay  yeah  this park\nlooks like it would be good for throwing shrimp. Now there's a question of\nhow we want to position the Barbie. I think sitting up  legs spread  such that it'll sort of\nserve as a backboard. Yeah. This is shrimp number one. Shrimp one. Hold on.\nSome of the— I'm gonna cut in \nyou know  sort of action shot. Yeah  yeah.\nWe got our... nice  juicy guy. Alright  this is\ngonna teach us a lot  I think  this first attempt. Yep. Okay. Oh—! Did it land on it? It hit the Barbie \nbut it is not touching. Oh  there is a seagull\nwho's eyeing the shrimp. I'm gonna have to defend\nthe shrimps as well. Oh  that was close. That's real close  but still... No cigar. Okay  I'm getting\nworse at it  Ben. Let's go! Close  close. Take your time with them. We got time  we got time. Now  now I'm\ngetting more nervous. I think  to be honest  I think they're going to play this higher risk  higher reward\nthan we are. Which can work out. But it can also not. Yeah  you need\nsome amount of risk in this game  for sure. I don't know\nwhat will work out. Yeah  I guess \nI would definitely say my attitude to the\nchallenges is sceptical. Alright  zen  zen mode. Let the Barbie come\nto the shrimp. No. Oh  that one. Okay  I'm not gonna panic yet. Oh—! Is that on the Barbie? Yes. Ohoho  baby!\nHit it! (growls) Let's go! Let's goooo! Check that out. I think that's unquestionable. (laughs)\nThat's unquestionable evidence. (pshooh!) So we're now theoretically going to have to wait\nhere for 25 minutes. It's taking a while to\nget us into the Gold Coast. Oh  wait. Oh  they just... Oh. Earned... $2.4k? That is...\nThat's a lot of money  yeah. I wonder what that was. 3x multiplier? A 3x multiplier \nand they put... $800 into it? But they didn't\neven have very much. Not ideal. Not ideal. But  okay. The thing that is\nworth noting is... they're playing really\nhigh risk  high reward. So... Yeah  the fact that\nthey got $2 400... Highly concerning. Highly concerning. Makes me think we want to\nmaybe ramp up our riskiness. Mhm. Alright  we'll get\nto the Challenge Board  see what we got \nand then see what's next. I'm freaking out.\n(laughs) I'm gonna die. Are we going all in? Is this the riskiest thing\nwe've ever done on Jet Lag: The Game? Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus We are so frickin' back! It's— No one can deny\nthat we're back. Yeah  and did you know\nthat that episode  episode 2 of this season  you can watch it\nright this very instant on nebula.tv. Nebula.com.\nNebula.tv. No  watchnebula.com\nor nebula.tv. Yeah  Ben  say words. What's even better:\nnebula.tv/jetlag. Another thing that you get\nwith your Nebula subscription is access to The Layover  which is our aftershow podcast where we break down\nthe episode with Toby. Toby's gonna be on this season. And we go into all the\nbehind the scenes  game design \nall the stuff that happened that you didn't see. So if you're interested in\ngetting more out of the season  The Layover is the\nbest way to do it. Truly one of the\npodcasts of all time. And Nebula is just\na great service otherwise. If you don't know about it \nNebula is a creator-owned and creator-founded\nand creator-run and audience-supported\nstreaming service. And it has all kinds of Originals from a lot of your\nfavorite creators. You also often get access\nto their YouTube videos early and ad-free. Every episode of Jet Lag\ngoes up one week early. We also post an outtakes\nand cut-for-time episode at the end of every season there. And most importantly  when you go to Nebula and\nyou sign up with our code... you are helping support the show. We get a portion of\nyour subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed. And also with our code \nit's a good deal for you because it's only $30 for the year. And I really want to emphasize. A lot of people get confused \nand they think it's $30 a month. And it's not.\nIt's $30 for the year  which nets out to $2.50 a month. Which is like  you know  not— It's like  I feel like\nthat's a reasonable amount for access to all of those things. That's less than a train fare. It's so much less than\nit costs to go on a train. That's true!\nYeah. In New York City  at least. Anyways but the thing to focus on is that right now  if you don't\nhave a Nebula subscription  you have nothing to do or watch. And that's bad.\n(wheezes) Your life sucks. Yeah  but if you do have\na Nebula subscription  you can watch\nseason 10  episode 2 of Jet Lag this very second! Oh my god \nyour life is awesome. Yeah  so good. Yes! And all you gotta do\nis go to nebula.tv/jetlag to sign up  get that 40% off. And thank you for your support. And thank you\nfor your support. I was trying to say it\nto somebody else. Oh  that's nice. Good bye!"

        "transcript": "Hello  and\nwelcome to episode two of Jet Lag: Australia. The goal of this game is to control more of Australia's eight regions\nthan your opponents by the end of four days. Winning is all about money. You take control of regions\nby depositing money in them  you have to spend money\nto travel between regions  and you earn more money\nby gambling on challenges. All of which is why\nme and my partner Toby are pretty concerned right now. Last episode \nour opponents Ben and Adam went to the difficult-to-reach\nregion of Tasmania  where they earned over $2 000 by winning big bets\non two challenges  including landing a\nshrimp on a Barbie. Meanwhile  Toby and I\nlost our bet on winning a carnival game\nin Sydney. Now we've flown to a\nnew region: Queensland. Specifically  we've flown\nto Gold Coast  Australia's amusement park capital  because several of the most\nvaluable Queensland challenges involve going to theme parks. If any of them pop up  we'll be in prime position\nto take advantage and get back in the game. Alright Toby \nchallenges are generated. What are they? First one  calculate boba. We've gotta guess within 10% how many boba are in the thing. Two  get goosebumps\nnear a goose. 3x multiplier  but I don't know where we're going to\nget a goose around here. Match your teammate. That's where we have\nto buy the same item without coordinating at a store. Challenge four: Movie World. We have to find a\nLooney Tunes character in the wild within an hour. When does Movie World shut? But it's a 3.5x multiplier. I don't think for a while.\nLet's check. There's a rainbow. Sam  there's a rainbow. Sam  get the rainbow. Make a wish \nand you better wish— I wish Ben and Adam's\nplane derails. No! Okay  Movie World\ncloses at... five? (grimaces)\nLet's calm down. Let's calm down.\nOh  that's bad. Oh my god. That sucks. That would have been\nreally good for us. That sucks! No! That would have been\nreally good for us. Because we're here\nat the Gold Coast. So  we're in a good spot. We've got our flight. I don't think there's any chance\nwe're gonna miss it. I shouldn't say that \nbut I think we're... yeah  not under a crazy\namount of time pressure. No.\nGot a lot of money. Yeah  so... I think first thing is  we should just invest\nsome of our money in Tasmania now. Because anytime you have\nmoney in your wallet  it is vulnerable to a steal. Yes. I don't know if we've\nexplained this yet. If we haven't  here's a little\nexplanation of what that is. While most challenges involve\ngambling some of your money to win a multiple of your money  steal challenges involve\ngambling some of your money to win a portion of\nyour opponent's money. Each steal is set at a\npercentage of a team's budget. A 40% steal  for example \nwould risk 40% of your money. If you won  you would\nget your money back  and you would take 40%\nof your opponent's money. You might notice that this means that if one team's budget\nis very low  and one team's budget\nis very high  a steal would be highly advantageous to the team that's behind. And yep  that's the point. The risk of steal means\nteams should be very careful about carrying a high balance. I think we want to put in\nat least $1 000 up to $1 500. But we can start with $1 000 just to get it out of our wallet. Boom  graphic. Okay  now \nit's really a question of  do we want to do the\nTim Tam cutting challenge? I feel okay\ntaking a risk right now. So maybe we just put $1 000 into the Tim Tam thing\nand try it. And if it— if we're really careful\nand we make it work  then there's another\n$1 000 in the bank. Alright  I'm willing\nto put in $1 000. It's scary.\nScares me. But I think we should do it. Okay  so now we have\nto go get Tim Tams. And we have to figure out\nwhat we want to cut them with. So  let's go do that. Oh  that's really unfortunate. What sort of theme park\ncloses at 5 pm? Disney World's open\nuntil like midnight. We're not in America anymore. As Ben and Adam went\nto buy their Tim Tams  Toby and I decided to\ncut our losses and head up to nearby Brisbane \nwhere we could do some of the day's\nlower value challenges. Brisbane  conveniently \nalso has an access point for Queensland's Challenge Board. So we'd be in a good position\nto check it tomorrow. Meanwhile  Adam and Ben\ngrabbed their Tim Tams and were ready to\ndo their challenge. Okay. So I think the question is \nwhat do we cut it with? I think the first place\nyour head goes is a credit card. We could always\nsharpen a credit card. I have my Lego VIP card. We could sacrifice that. Why don't we get a knife... and sharpen the card... and then cut the Tim Tam? While they sharpened\nBen's Lego Rewards card  on the way to Brisbane  we tried to salvage\nour bad challenge pool. And I came up with\nwhat I believed was a surefire way\nto nail one of them. The challenge requires one person\nto buy something at a store  which your teammates may\ninspect with their eyes closed. They must then go to the store\nand buy the exact same item. Other than revealing I wanted\nto go to the Apple Store  I couldn't tell Toby my plan  but I managed to\nconvince her to trust me that we should bet big. I feel good. As long as—\nYou seem very— You seem more confident\nthan I've seen you in a long time. I'm confident \nand I think if you... you think it through \nyou evaluate as much as you can. I'm confident. I don't love the phrase\n\"think it through\"  but... I think we want to do $900. Lock it in?\nI'm happy with it  yeah. I'll be right back.\nSee ya. This should do it. So  we've got our cookie here. And we're just going to leave\na little bit of it exposed. So  just  you know... We're just getting acquainted\nwith the cookie here. Wow  this is actually\nincredibly nerve wracking to watch happen now. Yeah. It's okay. Actually  I'm\nfeeling worse now... that I'm sort of seeing\nit happen. Alright. You ready? You got this  I'm sure. Alright  while Toby\nexamines the item  let me explain my strat. I bought an\nApple MagSafe charger. It's got a big round end to it  it's the only thing like it\nthat Apple sells  and it only comes in\none cord length with one type of port. This should be foolproof. I think... Yeah  no  come on. I probably looked\ninsane doing that. You ready? As ready as I guess I'll be. Excuse me. Oh  you're really going now. As you can see  the cookies\nare starting to pry apart. But I actually think that's... Dangerous. That's where we\nstart to get dangerous  'cause if there's\ntoo much leverage... Yeah.\napplied... This  I think  is sort\nof a danger zone situation. Yeah. Hello  Sam. Hello. How are you feeling? Let's see what you got. Got something\nin my pocket here. That sure looks right  Toby. (laughs) Nice job.\nAmazing! Nice job. That's great. Great  amazing.\nThat just gets us 900 extra... dollarydoos. That's what they\ncall 'em here  right? I think we're close. I see the cookies separating. Yeah  but we\njust don't wanna... make it— My biggest worry is stickage. Oh. Just move the one  I think. We've done it.\n(sighs heavily) We have two intact sides. That actually  I think \nwas a lot riskier than we thought it was. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay.\nUh-huh. Okay. Let's go to the airport... and go to Adelaide. Yeah. Hi. Just going to the airport. So... I reckon we want to\ngo get some boba. Uh-oh. Calculate boba. Bubble tea is a popular\nsnack all across Oceania. Order one bubble tea at\nany bubble tea vendor. From the second\nyou pick up your drink  you have one minute\nto examine it and determine the\nnumber of boba inside. Drink the tea and\nempty out the boba to check your answer. If you were more than 10% off  this challenge is failed. Let me just tell you  or let's just think\nabout what we think a boba-sized cup is. You could calculate the\nvolume of a cylinder  which is  you have a radius\nand the height of the pearls that you think it goes up to. Then you take that volume \nyou times it by 0.74  which is if you have\ntightly-packed spheres  how much space\nthey can possibly take up from the cylinder. Then you divide that number\nby the volume of the bobas. Well  if you can try\nthat while I'm doing it  and then I'll just do\nkind of the gut check. My confidence level\nis not great. Neither is mine. I think it's a real crapshoot. My confidence—\nShould we put... $206? Just to get rid of that\nand have nice easy numbers? Yeah.\nI'm happy with $206. Yep  let's do it.\nOkay  let's go to boba. Okay. Alright  here's the thing  Ben. I kind of think we should\nput down another $1 000. Yeah  I mean  we just got\nanother $1 000 pretty quick. I think  just saying. You know what \nthrow that down. There's $2 000 on Tasmania. I don't think they'll touch it. I think that sends\na clear signal. Because my strategy is  I don't want to have\nto come back places. Yeah  I agree. I don't think we want to\ngo halfway on a region  leave  and then come back later. I've enjoyed\nour time in Tasmania. I do not want to have\nto come back here. No. I want Tasmania\nto be locked up  and I want it to\nhave a number on it  where it's like... \"Oh man  it would really not\nbe worth it to go there.\" Right. We've got the money\nto put down another $1 000. I think we should just do it. Yep. Let's do it. Alright. Cue the graphic. Graphic  graphic  graphic  graphic. Good job  graphic. Alright. I think we did an\nincredible job in Tasmania. I agree.\nI think we cleaned up. And I think that we can\ndo the same thing in South Australia. Yep  yep. Hi  could I please have a regular green tea\nwith the tapioca pearls? Thank you. Number 8. Alright  Toby  come on. Alright  Toby  Toby.\nOur time starts. It's cloudier than I hoped. I feel like in one layer \nI counted about 22  24  and it looks like there's\nabout four layers tall. So I'd be comfortable\ngoing 80  maybe 82. 85. Okay  we got five seconds. 85  you wanna say 85? Lock it in? Lock it in  okay  85. You wanna get sippin'?\n(snickers) Doubts loading. Doubts loading. Whew.\nAlright. Adam  you're about\nto enter the hug zone. Whoa. Just make note of that. What do you reckon?\nIs this the kind of park where they let you\ncount your pearls? (shudders)\nEverybody out. Alright  make groups of ten. Eight  nine. One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight... Nine  no! No... no...\nNo. Naur. No.\nNaur. We need to be better. Well  we're here\nat the Hobart Airport. You know  we're just \nwe're about to board. But we've still got\nall of those Tim Tams. Yeah  the problem is that\nI left the Tim Tams somewhere. Oh  (bleep)  really? Yeah. They're in the\nSnack Zone  baby! We're going to\npredict some Snack Zones. If they've already eaten\na Tim Tam  do Adam's reaction\nto the Tim Tam. Well  I think everyone's\nreaction to the Tim Tam  including Adam's \nwould be like... \"Oh  this is... fine.\" This is... one of the most medium\ntasting things I've ever had. Alright  I'm going\nto stay on the ground because I feel like\nthis is where I belong. But what should we do now? We have a bit more\nthan an hour left. And the only challenge we could\nreasonably do is the swan. I just don't know how we\nwould possibly get goosebumps. The internet said that you can rub the hairs on\nyour arms very lightly. Well  we can try. We should—\nWe can try here to see if we can make it. The internet also said\nyou can just manifest them in your head \nat the back of your head. Can you? Here  let me try. We're (bleep)-ed. Alright  here we go. Wheee!\nGoodbye  Tazzy. Let's walk to the river and see if there's any geese there. Because we're obviously not\ngoing to make it to a lake. Yeah  no  and we want to be at the Brisbane sign\ntomorrow morning. Let's start walking. I don't see any geese. So... Should we go to the sign? So that's what we need to\ndo to generate challenges in the morning anyway. Yes  oh  let's go to the sign. It is a good sign. It's nice  yeah. It's got good colors. I think this is the end\nof our day one  right? I think so. We're not massively behind. We are certainly not ahead. I mean  I think\nwe're doing okay. Let's just do better tomorrow. Well  hopefully  you know  luck swings more onto\nour side tomorrow  because it seemed like it was pretty firmly on their side today. Alright  good night  everyone. Good night. Okay  welcome to\nAdelaide  South Australia. Thank you. I think it's time for bed. Alright  see you tomorrow. Mwah. Alright  now it's\nthe end of day one  and time for the first rest period. From 8:30 pm to 7:30 am\nSydney time  both teams must stop\nwhat they're doing and go to a hotel for\nsome much needed rest before restarting the game at the exact same spot\nthe next morning. And just like that \nthrough the magic of editing  it's time to start day two. Alright  good morning  Toby. Hi  good morning.\nIt's 6:30  and day two is now on. Good morning.\nGood morning. From South Australia. We need to get\nto the Challenge Board  which is where  in the park? We're going to Victoria Square. Yeah.\nBut we— I think we gotta get on a bus. 'Cause the trains are not\nconnected to the airport. Which  I think  is a bad idea. But also that's how it\nis in New York  so... Can't judge.\nCan't judge. Our challenges are generated. Should we take a look? Yeah  what are they? First one: Brisbane sign. That's a 40% steal.\nOh  would you look at that? Okay  cool. We might want to\nact on that quickly. In case they try to put\naway some of their budget. Yeah. Second one:\nland a bottle right side up. Third one: Dreamworld.\nThat's interesting. Fourth one: Wheel of Brisbane.\nThat's right there. Okay  but let's think\nabout the steal. We have about the same\namount of money right now. We both have like 22 \n20-ish  hundred-ish. We could invest a bunch\ninto Queensland right now so that our 40% is\na lot less than their 40%... and then go for the steal. Yes. I think we need to\ndecide pretty quickly so that they hopefully don't also\ndrop money onto their region. Just to clarify  because steals risk a set\npercentage of your budget to win a set percentage\nof your opponent's budget  you want to do steals\nwhen your budget is low and your opponent's budget is high. So before starting it  Toby and I deposited\n$750 into Queensland  lowering our budget and our risk. Then  before Ben and Adam could dump any of their\nmoney into South Australia  we informed them that\nthe steal was initiated  locking up 40% of their budget\nuntil it was complete. This steal challenge \nto be clear  is as follows: Mind meld at the Brisbane sign. One team member must  without giving any prior\nhints or information  select one letter in\nthe Brisbane sign. The other team member\nthen gets three attempts to guess which letter\ntheir partner selected. They just\ninvested in Queensland. How much? I'm trying to figure that out. Uh-oh  Ben. What? They have activated a steal. They've activated\na steal  okay. (sighs) Yeah  I feel stupid. I feel like we\nshould've invested money the second we got to Adelaide. I just didn't wanna... lock up too much of our money before we knew\nwhat was gonna happen. I just didn't realize the\ntiming would be that sensitive. But  okay  okay  look. Here's the thing about steals. Whatever it is that\nthey're doing  it's risky. Do you want to guess... or do you want to pick a letter? Do you have a preference? I don't have a preference. I'd like to pick the letter. Okay  well then we'll do that. You better get on\nmy brain wave  Sam. I'll let you\nknow when I'm done. Okay  I think there\nis only one letter that makes more sense\nthan the other ones... and that's the first one. Why would you pick\nanything but the first one  is my thinking  if we're\ntrying to pick the same one. So I'm just gonna\ntake a photo of the first B. (camera click)\nB. Toby! Okay  we wanna take the... yeah  the J2. Thank you. Thank you. I hope this bus is\ngoing the right way. Okay. Look  it's not great. No. I think in the future \nwhen we get somewhere  we should deposit\nimmediately. It's true. I mean  look.\nThat's the thing with the steals. They just are really risky. Yeah  I mean  we just have to hope\nthat they fail. I can't tell you anything. I can't. Okay  well  I'm just gonna\npsychically get on your brain wave. If I was the person taking\nthe photo of the letter... I would think  which letter has something\ndistinctive about it? So finding something that I guess both team members\nwould in their mind think is special about one letter. And so for that reason \nI'm going to pick the first letter \nwhich is the first B. Because that's special. You're not reacting. Am I right or wrong? Yes! That was the perfect logic. No other letter makes sense. Adam says \n\"Good luck with the steal  hope you fail  kiss emoji.\" You can send him \"40% of your money  please \nkiss emoji  kiss emoji.\" Ben  I have bad news. They succeeded at the steal. I also have further bad news  which is that we got on\na bus going the wrong way  and now we have to get off\nand get on a different bus. So it's not a very\ngood start to the day. No  we are 11 minutes in  and thus far... this has been atrocious for us. Well... I went in today\nfeeling so good. I started the day\nwith a lot of confidence. And then we got\non the wrong bus  and then they took\nhalf our money. Nice  alright \nwe're doing well. Woo! Okay  so  let's find a\ngood place to sit and chat. This is a nice little\npocket for strategy talk. Okay  so... So  Toby and I\nweren't too compelled by the rest of today's\nQueensland challenges. So we decided to look for\na flight to a new region. Ideally  we wanted\nto go to Canberra  in the Australian Capital Territory. It's a territory that's actually completely surrounded\nby New South Wales  but it counts just as much\nas any other region. The trouble was \nall the direct flights there were too expensive\nor poorly timed. But there was a cheap flight\nto Sydney in a few hours  and Sydney actually\nhas cheap and quick flights  trains  and even buses\nto the Capital Territory. So we decided we'd fly to Sydney \nshore up New South Wales  and then head to Canberra\nin the afternoon. So we booked that flight  and with the time before\nwe needed to go to the airport  we figured we might as well\ncomplete this challenge  which requires you to flip a bottle\nand land on its lid. It didn't seem too tough \nso we wagered $500 on it and got the bottle with the\nbiggest lid we could find. Finally  we also deposited an\nadditional $596 in Queensland in order to further\nreduce our budget in case Ben and Adam  who had finally gotten on\na bus going the right way  got access to a steal. Alright  Ben. Let's go to\nthe Challenge Board. You know  it took us a little\nlonger than anticipated  but we're gonna make it there. (groans angrily) Things were going so good\nan hour ago. The ducks here are very polite. That's not a duck  though. What is that one? What are you? Okay  they don't like me. Let's see what the challenges\nin South Australia are today. Adam? Predict market flow\nat Adelaide's Central Market. You have to pick a\nstall at the market and guess how many people\nare going to go to it. 40% margin of error. Toss a tempting meal. We have to throw food\non the ground  and within 10 seconds \nan animal has to eat it. I think we could do that here. I think we could do it here. Face Tim Tam. That's where you gotta do a\nface cookie with a Tim Tam. And there's a steal. There's a steal  okay. You have to go to\nthe National Wine Centre and  blindfolded  distinguish\nbetween a white  a red  and a rosé. Which would be easy\nfor a normal person  but we don't know\nanything about wine. No  we don't drink wine at all. Okay. Definitely gets you going. I'm gonna take this off.\nMore friction. Is this attempt one?\nI don't know. Well  let me give it a first go. Give it an attempt. See how it goes \nand let's adjust from there. No.\nOkay. I think we need\nto try to earn... $2 000 here. You also have to keep in mind  we need to have enough\nmoney to get out of here. What we've been seeing is that the flights out of here\nare pretty expensive. The safest one is the meal. Yeah. But it has a low return. It has a low return. But maybe we just put\na ton of money into it. I think we can do the birds. Okay  how much money\nare we putting down on it? A decent amount\nfor it to be worth it. Yeah  it's only 1.5. What do you think?\nI think half  $850. Okay  $850. Toss a tempting meal. Throw a single piece of food. Within 10 seconds of it\ntouching the ground or water  something besides you must eat it. If the food is not eaten\nafter 10 seconds  this challenge is failed. Alright.\nLet's go find a bird food. They're still just\nin downtown Brisbane. I have no idea what challenge\nthey're possibly doing right now  but  I don't know. I hope they fail it  I guess. (grimaces) (grunts) Okay. I'm getting a little stressed. Just calm down  actually. Take a five minute breather. What is ducks' favorite food? Ducks enjoy berries \nmelonseed  and pitfruits. What about a blueberry? I like blueberry best  because I think a\nblueberry is like a treat. Yeah  it's more tempting. Okay  let's get some blueberries. Oh  now I'm scared. Thank you. I think... this ground is pretty slippery. Yeah  I think let's find\nsome more coarse ground. Maybe over there. (rapid scraping) Oh  you're roughening it up? Yeah. (giggles) I don't know what this is. (grumbles) I want to watch a video. We're going to\ntake our time with this. I'm so scared now. Okay  don't be scared. Alright.\nDucks? Okay. I think I'm more\napproachable to ducks. Yep. Ducks  how about a\nlittle blueberry treat? Is this interesting to them? We're going to\nget on their level. (duck quacks) Okay. He's yelling about it. (duck quacks) What are you saying? What about  there's\nseveral ducks over here. Why don't you let me try\nwith the ducks this time? See  they're walking away. You're going too fast. They really don't trust us. No  they don't like us at all. The ducks don't\ncare about this at all. Okay. Ready? Yep. What happened there? It just... it landed like this... and then kinda\ncareened that way. Is that  yeah  look at that. That bottle's always\ngoing to fall over. We're not using that bottle anymore. I think we need a new bottle. Okay  let me just  I'll quickly\ngo run and come back. I mean  we could\ntry a different food. Well  I just think we need\nto get closer to the ducks. Wait  look at this. There's a girl feeding the ducks. Oh  this is huge news. Oh  they love being fed. Okay  this might be our chance. They're all around\nlooking for food. They're in the mood. Do you want to go for it? I think this is our chance. Okay. Go for it. There it is. There it is. One. Two. Three. Four. Find it.\nFive. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. No. Ugh. Ugh. That's so stupid. Oh my gosh  I can't\nbelieve we blew that. That is terrible  Ben. Okay. This is not good news! I think we want\nto go to Melbourne. Well  we need $1 300 for that. Right  we don't have enough money\nto go to Melbourne. So we gotta do Face Tim Tam  Adelaide's Central Market  or... But the thing is  if we try\nanother challenge and fail  I struggle to see how\nwe'll ever get enough money to leave Adelaide today. Yeah  I agree. But we've gotta do something. I know. I mean  the truth is  we're just in a\nvery bad position now. Yeah  no  we are. It's just  the question is  how do we get in a\nless bad position? Flip it one and a half times. Or even— (grunts) This isn't going to work. We need to solve it somehow. I just don't know how  and I know that if we\nwant to make our flight  we don't have infinite time. But this is really\nimportant to get right. I know  but to be honest  I just kind of regret\nstaking this much. It's a lot harder\nthan I thought it was. Can I run and\nget another bottle? I mean  sure  yeah. I'm going to leave you here\nunattended for a minute. Okay. Yeah  I mean  we can\ndefinitely get one  but I'm not sure it\nmakes sense to flip. Hello  we've been really\njust going back and forth trying to figure out what is\nthe best thing to do here  because the fact of the matter is  we just  we don't\nhave great options. The flights out of here\nare all really expensive. I don't know why \nand it's just today. I think we want to\npredict market flow. How much should we bet? We have $1 064\nat the moment  Ben. If we bet $600... then we would have $464 left. If we failed.\nYeah. That's probably\nour safest option. Okay  $600. It's big  big epic win time. Here we go. Okay  $600.\nWe're going in. Predict market flow at\nAdelaide's Central Market. Adelaide's Central Market is\none of the largest produce markets in the southern hemisphere. Select any market stall\nand make a prediction about how many customers\nit will get in the next 10 minutes. A customer is defined as any person\nwho spends money at the stall. If your prediction\nis more than 40% off  this challenge is failed. If no one visits the stall\nin the 10 minutes  you lose automatically. I think that... the key to this is simple. High volume... reduces variability. So we just need to find\nthe busiest stand we can. Observe it for like a half hour  put in our guess  and then as long as\nnothing drastically changes  we'll be fine. I think that that first place\nwhen we walked in  that's our best option. Let's observe. I'm gonna go\nget a custard tart. Do you want one? Uh  no. Iced latte? Yeah. Okay  I might have\ngone a little bit crazy  but I think this is the best shot  because I think it's\nbetter than that one. Mm-kay.\nAnd then I got this one in case we can find a video\nof Logan Paul flipping it  because I feel like that's possible. Okay  we have about 10 minutes\nto be able to comfortably That's okay.\n...make it to the airport. Yeah  this one doesn't\nseem a whole lot better. Okay  if it's not going\nto work  just discard it. Hello. Okay  so... We've been watching\nthis market stall for what  30 minutes? Yeah  super normal behavior. At this food market  we recorded three different\nperiods of 10 minutes. The number of customers\nwere 10  then 20  then 14. Which is a wider range\nthan I would like. I think that the 10\nis the biggest outlier in that we were\ndoing that earlier. So if we guess 20  our range of 40% on both ends would be 12 to 28. And I think the real concern\nwould just be getting over 12. I think we'll hit 12. Okay  do we want to\nguess 20? Do we want to lock\nthat in right now? Okay  the market looks busy. I think we're going to start now. Are you ready  Adam?\nYep  yep. Ten minute timer starts... now. You count people\nwhen they pay. If it's a group of two \nthey only count as one. Yep. So that's one person's paid. That's two people have paid. Great. Okay  new woman. That's three. Three. That's four. Four. Okay  we're at four. Okay. Is this\nanother customer? This looks like a duo. Oh my god. I am... I'm freaking out.\n(laughs) I'm gonna die. Alright  we have\nthree attempts left. You've got this. I'm gonna give it my all.\nI believe in you. I don't think\nthe odds are good. Doesn't matter.\nYou can do it. Oh god  Ben. No one's coming.\nIt's emptying out. More than I'd like.\nWhy did it empty out? Why did it empty out? We guessed too high  Ben.\nIt's okay. These people are\nanother customer. We've got a woman buying\ngrapes in front of us. Okay  so they'll get us to six. I'm freaking out. So this lady will be five  right? Yep. Oh no  the people who were\nlooking over there have gone. They've left  Ben. Wait.\nOh no  they're back. There's more  there's more.\nYeah  yeah  yeah. Okay  that's a duo.\nSo that's five. These people will be six. Once they've paid  they'll be six. (shudders) Alright  two more. This is it. Okay  you've\ngot the feel for it. You've got the feel for it. That was all practice.\nI mean  I'm confident that I'm giving it my best shot. Yeah  you got\nheaps of practice. Okay  they've paid. That's six. That woman is seven. We're at four minutes \nand we're at seven. I think that's pretty good. This guy's eight. Okay  and we've got\nthis woman with a watermelon. Yeah  she's at nine. Look  we have four minutes\nand fifteen seconds to get three more purchases. Uh-oh  now there's no one\nmanning the cash register. No  go back to\nthe cash register. We have four minutes.\nWe need three more purchases  Ben. Three more purchases.\nA lot of people  I feel like  abandoned the stand. Alright  this is it. You've got the feel for it. That was all practice. This is it. This is it.\nYou've got this. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Oh  god dammit. Okay well  I mean  if you want to see how that goes  I guess you can watch\nthe next episode right now on— You're getting worse at this.\nOh god dammit. Stop pressuring me! Watch the next episode\nnow on Nebula. It's available right now on Nebula \nlike all of our episodes. Here  can you do the rest?\nI need to do this. You can find out if Sam\nmanages to flip the bottle. You can see if Ben and I\nmanaged to hit our minimum at the Adelaide Central Market. You can also listen to\nthe Layover podcast. The Layover podcast is an\nexclusive aftershow podcast (bottle lands)\n– that one was close – that we do after every episode where we recap the episode \nwe give you the behind the scenes  we talk about things we had to cut. And Toby's there! And Toby does\nthe podcast with us for this season. So that's fun \nand you can listen to it. But only on Nebula.\nOh my god. And on Nebula \nyou also get access to a lot of other really great\noriginal content from other creators that you love. We've got Modern Conflicts from\nRealLifeLore  a great series. We've got some original series from Real Engineering. We've got a whole bunch of\nOriginals from Lindsay Ellis. We've— There's no\nend to the con— I mean technically there\nis an end to the content. But I should say that there is just a lot of great original\ncontent on there. And a lot of other stuff\nfrom us as well. Sam  wrap it up. Uh  um  it's cheap. It's not very expensive. It's what  like 30 bucks a year? Only if they go to our link \nnebula.tv/jetlag  where they get 40% off. But $30 for a year \nhow many months are there? There's 12. And what is 30 divided by 12? It's like 4. It's two and a half. Yeah  okay  yeah. It's $2.50 a month  which... that's not many dollars. That's not that many dollars.\nThat's not that many dollars. It's not none \nbut it's not that many. Well  it's enough dollars\nto fund this entire show. That's true.\n'Cause like... We make this\nwhole show for $2.50. Yeah  well  mm  yeah. It genuinely does support the show. It genuinely— Every single\ndollar to produce this show comes thanks to our\nNebula subscribers. That's why we release every\nsingle episode one week early. That's why we do\nthe Layover podcast. So we really appreciate\nwhen you do sign up at nebula.tv/jetlag. Flip the bottle \nend the ad reading. And we're gonna get it right.\nWe're gonna get it right. Here we go.\nIt's gonna be so good. Not even close.\nNot even a little bit. No  we're gonna VFX that. You know  VFX team is gonna do it.\nI said I can do it. No  you're not gonna do it. That was close though.\nNo it wasn't. Okay  bye."

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nto episode three of Jet Lag: Australia. Right now  the board\nlooks like this  and the teams are here. As a reminder \nthe team that controls more of Australia's eight regions\nat the end of four days will win. Teams control regions by\ndepositing money in them  but teams also have\nto spend that money to travel between the regions. And they can earn more money\nby gambling on challenges. Well  unless they lose\nthe challenge  in which case they lose money. Which brings us to this episode. Right now  both teams\nhave made big bets on high-risk challenges. After losing almost all of\ntheir money last episode  Ben and Adam need to\nwin this challenge where they've predicted\nhow many people will visit a fruit stand in\nAdelaide's Central Market. They need at least\ntwelve customers  and with only three minutes left \nthey're only at nine. Toby and I  meanwhile  have to flip a bottle\nand land on its lid. Which so far\nwe've struggled to do. We've got one last attempt before we fail\nand lose our $500 bet. Well... Okay  there's\na new guy in here. Come on  we just need\nthree more. Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah. You want to buy\nthose vegetables right now. Come on  go to\nthe cash register. Okay  he's ready to buy  right? No? No  he's going back. They're buying.\nThey're buying. Here we go. I'm in a complete panic. This is ten.\nOh  this is two! This is two. Okay. Ten and eleven.\nTen and eleven. We just need one more. Oh  this guy's in line now. Oh no  he left. I'm just gonna\ndo some observing. We only have\na minute and a half. (gargles mic) Oh  here he goes! Yes! Oh no  he's going back\nto get more stuff. Oh  okay. No  no.\nIt's okay  it's okay. That's twelve.\nThat's twelve. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. That's thirteen. Challenge complete. Here's what I'll say  Toby. You remember how\nwe said yesterday  we need to double down\non confidence and not chase long shots? Yeah? I think we violated that\nwith this challenge. So far  we've done great\nwhen we're confident. We've done terribly\nwhen we're not and we do long shots. We need to stop it.\nWe need to calm down. And we need to recalibrate\nour confidence. Only doing things we're\nsure on from here on out. Yes. Alright  let's go to Sydney. I kinda feel like that was the first moment that\nwe just properly misplayed. I'm pretty upset\nat the moment. Ugh! Look  we did it.\nWe did it. We did it. Thank god. We got it.\nThank god. Now we've got a little\nbit of capital to work with. Okay  let's leave this place. Let's decide what to do next. Okay  here we go.\n(whines) We need to\nburn into our brains: Just because we can\ndo a challenge  doesn't mean that we should.\nDoesn't mean we should. Yeah. We've learned our lesson\non day two. Yes. It's less than\ntwo hours into day two. And here's the thing \nwe've learned lessons. I don't know if\nBen and Adam have. Hopefully they start\nlearning lessons now. Maybe they haven't learned\nany lessons yet. Yeah. Look what we found. I think we're— I think\nwe have to celebrate by buying these hats. Yeah  celebrate from\nclawing our way back from the depths of hell. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.\nThank you. Now  I feel like\nwe've transcended to our... We're in a lot\nbetter place now. Mentally  spiritually. As far as accessories go. Hello. Hello  okay. So  here is my assessment of the situation we're in. I don't think that it's\ngoing to be possible to make enough money\nin Adelaide to put down an amount that is really going to\ndeter them from coming here. No  I think that dream\nis pretty much dead. We would have to stay here\nuntil tomorrow. Yeah. And I don't think\nwe want to do that. Here  I think \nare really our options. I think we should go\nto Melbourne. I agree  and we\nshould go to Melbourne before they go to Melbourne. I think that they're\non a flight right now  and I think that flight's to Sydney. I'm not positive \nbut I think that that's right. As Toby and I flew to Sydney  where  as a reminder  our plan is to knock out\nsome challenges before taking a bus to the\nAustralian Capital Territory  Ben and Adam made a plan to\nfly to Melbourne at 1:50 pm. With the time before the flight  they wanted to do the\nWine Centre steal  but their bus to the\nWine Centre never came  making their only option\nto earn more money the Face Tim Tam \non which they wagered $300. Alright  where do you want\nto attempt the Face Tim Tam? I think you're gonna do it  because you have a\nlarger and flatter face. We have assessed the\ngeometry of each of our faces  and I think I will\nhave an advantage. There's flat steps here. I mean  would it be helpful for me to show you\nan image of yourself? That could be helpful. It's already kind of\nmelty on my fingies. Good. I actually think that's the key.\nAlright  so I think— Just be nice and\ncareful and deliberate. Oh  your forehead is\nfully covered in chocolate. This is my intention. I actually think this is\nthe riskiest part  and I'm gonna let it\nmelt down my nose. Oh  this is\nreally precarious now. Seems really dangerous\nat the moment. It seems like it could\nflip over the other way. You need to get it all the way\non that side of your face. Yeah  yeah  I see it. Once I get the tongue in play. Yeah. I think this is the\nmost dangerous part. I think you're doing\nreally good. You did it  you did it. Wow! Wow  that was incredible. (full mouth)\nVictory! Let's go to the airport. I am ready to get\nthe hell out of here. It's so hot. Hey Ben \nhere's a question for you. (rapping)\n♪ How low can you go? ♪ ♪ Can you go down low? ♪ I can't really go down\n♪ All the way to the flo'? ♪ ...that much lower. ♪ How low can you go? ♪ This low.\nBen! Have they landed somewhere yet? For god's sake? Welcome back. Oh wow  the camera\nreally does not like the refresh rate of these lights. Well anyway \nlet's get to the train  get to Circular Quay \ncheck out the challenges. Looks like they\nlost one challenge  won two. They're up to about $2 000.\nThat's still a lucky thing on this. And it looked like\nthey were heading to the airport  which means... they could be trying to\ngo to that Perth flight. It'd be a little bit tight \nbut if they... They could be  but we'll learn soon. If they are going to Perth \nthat's our chance to swoop in. I think so. Not mess things up if\nwe have that opportunity. Yeah. It opens up a\nstrategic lane  basically. Let's go. Back at the airport. We we're having trouble\nbooking our flight. So once again  we're gonna\ngo talk to a gate agent. Here's the only other thing\nI would mention... is that we're paying\na really stupid amount to go to Melbourne \nwhich should be cheap to get to. Yeah. You could argue that\nwe should go to Perth. This is true. Those flights to Perth are \nwhat  two grand? Yeah. We would have to see\nhow much money we have. I think we might\nactually have enough. We can look. We have $1 964. I actually think\nthere is a Perth flight that we could take\nfor that much. $1 906 to Perth. It's not the craziest idea  Ben. And it would be in an hour. We could get on it right away. I kinda think\nwe should do that. It's not bad. I think we\nshould do that  Ben. Because that way\nwe're actually— That makes sense! Go to Perth now  knock it out. This is an amount that makes\nsense to pay to go to Perth. We shouldn't spend $1 300\nto go to Melbourne. No  that's true. We can definitely get to\nMelbourne for cheaper later. Let's do this! We have to hurry if we're\ngoing to book this flight. Well  let's go. I really hope Ben and Adam... get on that flight to Perth today. They will certainly\nget on that flight. I think it's very likely \nknowing them. And I think that is\none of our best opportunities. Let's book it. Let's book it. Okay  here we go. 'Cause booking's gonna\nclose in a few minutes. Oh my god.\nWhat if it times out? You got it  you got it. Come on  baby. (bleep) There's an error. Okay  we need to try to\ntalk to a gate agent. Hi  we were trying\nto book last minute on the 1:20 to Perth \nbut then it wouldn't work. Trying to—\nWe're trying to buy a ticket. Yes ma'am. I don't think we can—\nWe can't do that. Yeah  unfortunately not. Thank you though. Oh  that sucks. We couldn't get\non the Perth flight. It's too soon  too expensive. Just gotta figure out a\nway to get to Melbourne. There's a Qantas flight\nto Melbourne at 1:50. It seems to say that\nit's sold out  but they might still have tickets. Let's go try. (groans) Let's go to the Qantas desk. Oh  that's a big boy. This is our stop. It's a big boy. Big boy indeed. So... It seems like Ben and Adam are\nat the airport in Adelaide  but they haven't...\nbooked a flight. We absolutely cannot\nmake sense of this. I kinda wonder if\nthey're just having trouble getting out of there \nand I don't know why. Yeah  I wonder\nif it's a budget issue. Some other kind of issue. Their behaviour is definitely\nthrowing us for a bit of a spin. Yes.\nYeah  it's concerning when you can't understand\nwhat your opponent is doing. Yeah  I mean\nthat usually means either something quite\ngood for you is happening  or something quite bad\nfor you is happening. Or we're\nmissing something big. Things are all falling apart. We should have just\nbooked earlier! We were just trying to book\non the 1:50 pm to Melbourne. It seemed to be sold out\nright at the last minute. We were just seeing if\nthere happened to still be any seats available on that? It's too late to book that? Okay.\nOkay. Great  thank you.\nThank you very much. Okay  now everything's\n(bleep)-ed up again. The other one's gone. The cheaper  later one\nis gone now. The 5:40's gone?\nYeah. Oy vey. I don't understand\nwhat the hell is happening. Yeah  these flights are\njust dropping like flies. Hold on. Hold on  hold on  hold on. Hold on  I think\nI've got the 1:50. I have five minutes to book it \nor it's gonna close out. Alright  good luck. (rustling) Got it. You got it?\nYeah. Today  Adelaide\nto Melbourne  $1 300. That's real? Seems to be real. How'd you get it?\nI don't know. I just went to the Qantas website. Seems to want us to\ncheck in at the airport  so let's do that. Anyway  let's get to the steps and generate new challenges. We have about\ntwo and a half hours until the last train—\nor the last bus we could take out of here. Oh yeah  so we should\nmove pretty fast. Yeah.\nLet's get those challenges up. The cruise ship has\na carnival ride on that thing. What's that little thing\nat the very top? The cruise ship\nsees something he likes. Maybe there's\na sister ship off the— Oh wait  no  not sister.\nMaybe there's a... ...a cousin?\nNo  it's not allowed. Alright  welcome back. Should we take a look\nat the challenges? Yes  what do we got? Number one  ooh.\n30% steal. Throw a democracy\nsausage into a bun. We get five attempts. Interesting. Number two  also a steal. 50% steal. Successfully throw\nand catch a boomerang. We don't love our hand-eye\ncoordination challenges so far  so I don't feel like\nthose are great. Number three  though \nis a 2x multiplier  and it's an Australian slang quiz. Okay. You probably have the\nbest knowledge of anyone about Australian slang. Oh  surely  surely\nI must be able to. So we probably—\nAnd you've lived here. That means you have the\nbare minimum slang knowledge. Hopefully  but\nwe definitely have an advantage over them on that. And then the last one \n3.5x multiplier  but it's surfing at\nManly or Bondi Beach. Dead. We're both dead. We don't have time\nfor that anyway  so... Well  we definitely want\nto do the slang quiz. Slang quiz sounds good  and... But the question is \nwould we want to attempt any of the steals? Or would we just want to\nget to Canberra sooner? I think I would rather\nget to Canberra earlier and generate challenges there. What did we just learn\nabout challenges like this? Yeah  long shot challenges. Technically we can do\nthe quiz wherever. Most of the bus to Canberra is in New South Wales \nif you wanted. Yeah  so we could\nliterally do it on the bus. Okay.\nSo let's figure out what the fastest way\nto Canberra is  and then get to that. Well that was\na giant rigmarole to do what we were planning\non doing the whole time. We're back. I think we managed to\nbook the original flight. We just need to check in. Oh  it cost so much. It was $1 300 total.\n(giggles) Unbelievable. Yeah.\nOne way. I know  but we\nhave to get there fast. Unfortunately \nwe don't have time. Thank you so much. Gate 22 after security. Thank you. Well  we've successfully paid an outrageous amount of money (giggles)\n...to go to Melbourne. I wouldn't call it a win \nbut at this point... I'll take anything.\nAt this point  I'll take it. Okay  there's only\none Greyhound left  and it's too late. So... Murray's  I think \nis probably more frequent. Mhm. So we could make\nthe 2... the 2 pm. Does that make sense?\nOkay. I think that makes sense.\nYeah. Well  let me do that. Oh  wait. They're sold out. Oh my god. How many of them\nare sold out? It's booked until 4 pm. That's not great. (murmurs) Hmm. Let's get in the shade\nand decide what to do. Can we call Murray's\nand just check— double check? 'Cause if there's any way\nthey can squeeze us on  that would be amazing. I mean  we could just\nhead to Central Station now and see if we can—\nThey have an office there  Murray's office in Central.\nYeah. I'm not seeing\nany on Murray's. Were you seeing some at all? Yeah  the short 4 pm\nwas showing available for me. Mine is not showing any. Maybe it just got bought. Requested seats are\nno longer available. This is not great. Well  we might have to rethink\nthe plan for the rest of the day. Okay...? We should've booked it earlier. Yep. We're headed to Melbourne. We're gonna get the\nMelbourne bonus. Unless something insane happens. Now we have to decide\nhow much money to put in Adelaide  and I frankly think it's one dollar. Yeah  I just don't think\nthat we can put down an amount of money that's\ngonna deter them anyway. So we might as well\nkeep it and use it for now. Even with the welcome bonus... if we were to start off\nin Melbourne with under $1 000  I would find that very precarious. We found today that... that was a very bad spot\nto be in. Yeah  I think that we're... We kind of need every dollar\nin our wallet right now. Well  except for the one dollar\nthat we're gonna put down here. We don't need that dollar.\nYep  alright. Let's put one dollar\nin South Australia. Okay  they deposited\na dollar in Adelaide. Okay  one dollar\nin South Australia. I guess they think\nwe're not going there. That means that\nwe are currently in control of South Australia. They do—\nThey could come here and put down two dollars\nand claim it  but they gotta make their way\nall the way over here. They have to get here \nand that's annoying. I think there's a good chance\nthat they're gonna steal it from us. Our grip on it is\nquite literally as weak as it possibly could be \nbut who knows? Maybe they'll just ignore it\nfor the rest of the game. Well  here's a thing. What do you got? We can get to Adelaide\nfor $249. Oh! (chortles)\nWe know... that they only left a dollar. And they've just left. Sam  we have to go\nto Adelaide. I think that might be it.\nOh my god. I love that. 'Cause they're\nprobably thinking that we wouldn't go there\n'cause it's too out of our way. Yes. But... The best thing in this game\nis to be travelling behind someone. It wastes the maximum\namount of their time. If they want it  they're\ngonna have to come here  and that'll be a\nwhole hassle for them. I think that's the key. And hopefully we can... we can do a little better\nin Victoria and... secure that nice and good. So... what do you think? Should we plan on kinda\nfinishing the day in Adelaide and doing that quiz? Yeah. I don't see a better— Let's sit down. We have time. Let's sit down and be sure. Okay. So  we need to pick\nfour regions at this point. You know  we've already\npicked Queensland. We've already picked\nNew South Wales. And I think\nit makes sense to do Capital Territory\nand/or South Australia because we think that they're\ngoing to Melbourne now. Yeah. The one dollar on Adelaide\nmeans one of two things. Either they know\nthey're going back  and they didn't want\nto waste money now  or they think\nwe're never going there. It's hard to know\nwhat they're thinking. While we're on\nour way over here  a baby pointed at me\nand said  \"Kookaburra\". Which  I don't see it. Put up a picture of\na kookaburra. I don't see it. That's not accurate. Right? So  let me summarize\nthe options. So  basically we've decided\nwe either want to go to Canberra next or Adelaide next  followed by the opposite. The only question is \nwhich order do we do? Yeah. I'm starting to think that even though the flight\nto Adelaide is cheaper  it makes more sense to\ngo to Canberra first so that we can get\nthe welcome bonus. Because we know they\nwill not beat us there. Considering that... we can effectively\npay for our flight  minus a little bit \nwith the welcome bonus  get there  and then as of now  there's a really cheap option with\na quick connection in Melbourne to get to Adelaide tomorrow. We can go there and potentially\nlock it up with just $2. If we're going the opposite way  I worry they get to the\nCapital Territory first and claim the welcome bonus. Which not only is\n$750 less for us  it's $750 more for them. I think I lean towards Canberra first. Yeah  it's tough because\nwe were so excited on the train to find that Adelaide option. And I hate to give\nyou all watching whiplash. Let's go to Canberra \nthen go to Adelaide. And hopefully  from Adelaide  there'll be cheap flights\nback to Melbourne or Sydney. Let's look into booking\nthat Canberra flight. Well  the 3:35 is a\nlittle cheaper than the 4  but that would be a little tight. There's no reason\nwe can't go right now. Okay  well let's—\nWe'd have to go right now. So this is\nan interesting thing in Australia\nI've never seen before  is you board from\ntwo different sides of the plane. It's actually kinda smart. Yeah. They seem to board\ntheir planes and... 'Cause they— we also got\nlet off in two different places. Yeah. It seems to be just much faster.\nSeems to work well though. I don't know. Learn. Learn from Australia \nthe rest of the world. Alright. Back again. What was that  90 minutes\nin the airplane? Okay. Made it through security. We got about... 20 minutes till boarding. Let's do the quiz. How much do we\nwant to stake? Okay  we're feeling\nfairly confident. And is this\na broken confidence like the other\nconfidence we had? Or is this a true \ngenuine confidence? I mean... At the very least \nwe know that we can do this better than Ben and Adam.\nYeah. Because you're from here.\nI've lived here. We do know we're gonna\nget $750 when we land there. $500.\nI'm fine with $500. I could do $600.\nI could be $600. You wanna do $600?\nCould do $600. Let's do $600  okay. Oh my god. Do we do crowd think?\nI think we do crowd think. I think we avoid pushing each other\nI think we do. to make potentially bad decisions.\nOkay  lock it in  $600? Should we do it?\nYeah. Oh hi  Amy. G'day mates \nhow are we going? I'm not sticking with my\nterrible Australian accent  but welcome to your\nAustralian slang quiz. I've got four multiple choice\nquestions for you  and one matching question. You can get one\nmultiple choice wrong  or miss one of the matching terms\nbefore I void your contract. Question one \nwhat is a 'bloody ripper'? Is it A)\na car that's speeding  B) something that's really great  C) a hot dog with ketchup  or D) a wave that's\nreally hard to surf? Oh  it's B. Yeah  it's gonna be B. Let me just rule everything out. Speeding car  no. Hot dog and ketchup  no. You should— I'm sure it's B. I'm quite sure it's B.\nGo with B. A bloody ripper is... B) something that's really great.\nYes. On to question two. What is a 'budgie smuggler'? Is it A) a small Australian rodent \nOh  I know that.\nWe know this. B) a fanny pack  C) a speedo  Or D) a government official\nwho handles taxes? We're doing speedo? Yeah  let me just read them. Do-do-do-do-do-doot. I know it's a speedo.\nYeah  it's a speedo. A budgie smuggler is a speedo. Alright  question three. What does it mean\nto 'shout' something? Is it A) to clean it  B) to throw it  C) to recommend it  or D)\nto buy it for someone? It's to buy it for someone. It's like  you shout someone a beer. I'm sure of that. Okay  I wasn't as sure.\nSo I'm glad you know that. No  I'm 100% sure\nthat it's like  if I shout you a beer \nit's like I buy it. If you're sure of it \ngreat  let's do it. D?\nD. To shout something is... to buy it for someone else. There we go.\nNeed one more. For question four \nI'm gonna say something to you  and you need to pick the option that would be an appropriate\nresponse to what I've said. So here we go.\nOh  so advanced. So  I'm an ambo \nand a bit of a battler  and I almost chucked\na sickie last night  but I didn't  and it\nwas completely chockers. What would be an appropriate\nresponse to that statement? A) \"You absolute servo\"  B) \"Tockies!\"  C) \"Hard yakka  mate\"  or D)\n\"Sounds like a crazy arvo!\"? \"So I'm an ambo\" \nso an ambulance worker. \"And a bit of a battler  and\nI almost chucked a sickie.\" So  called in sick\nwhen you're not really sick. \"But I didn't  and then it\nwas completely chockers.\" So she went to work  and it was really full\nof people at work. Yep.\nSo  they're set. It could be\nC) \"Hard yakka  mate.\" As in  you did hard work. It could also be\n\"Sounds like a crazy arvo\"  because it was\na crazy arvo at work. Doesn't that mean afternoon? Yeah.\nBut... Last night.\nSo I don't think it's that. That's a good way\nto rule that out. What is \"tockies\"? I don't know \"tockies\". And \"absolute servo\" could\nalso work because it's like... No  because servo\nmeans service station  like where you get gas.\nOh  yeah. It must be C. Should we lock in C?\nC. The correct answer is C) Hard yakka  mate. We got it. Alright  your\nlast question is matching. I'm going to put\nfive slang terms and seven definitions\non the screen. You have to match\nthe correct term to the correct definition. If you got all the\nmultiple choice right  you can get one of these wrong\nbefore I void your contract. Wait.\nOh  so we still have to get all of them right\nexcept one on this. Oh boy  okay. Okay.\nPorky. A lie. Ken oath. I don't know\nwhat 'ken oath' means  but 'oath' on its own\nwould mean like  \"yeah\"  like \"so true\". Shonky means poorly made. Galah... might be an idiot. And 'hooroo'\nI've never heard before. Oh boy. I'm pretty sure with\nthe other four though  so... It's just hooroo.\n'Ho-roo'? 'Hoo roo'. I feel like it could be\n'good bye'. But honestly I don't think\nI've ever heard that  have you? No. Hooroo? Have you ruled out 'snobby'? Oh  you know what? Like  \"he's a bit hooroo \"\nyou know? Oh.\nThat kind of sounds right. Hooroo. Hooroo. I feel pretty good\nabout that  between those three. If you have no idea. Should we lock it in? Here are the answers\nfor the matching. A porky is a lie. Got that. Saying \"ken oath\"\nis like saying \"that's so true\". Shonky is an adjective\ndescribing something poorly made.\nOkay. Galah is an idiot. And hooroo is goodbye. Oh  but we got it.\nSo hopefully you did well. We still got it.\nHop you guys are having fun. Hooroo. We got it  Sam. (sighs) That's a little\nclose for comfort. (softly)\nTake a breath. We made it. Okay. Hooroo. Oh no  you know what \nnow that she says that. I mean  in that intonation. Yeah  in that intonation. That's great.\nThat's great news for us. That was harder\nthan I was expecting. Look at that budget. That's a nice little budget. Alright  let's go on the flight. Here's what I\nhave to say to you. Let's boogie. Let's boogie. Welcome to Victoria. Alright  so \nwe need to go board  but based on that \nwe have $1 243. Do we want to pop\nsome money down here? I lean towards yes. Let me check out\nthe current standings. We've put already some on here. Yeah  we have $400 \nso we could  you know... I could put personally\nlike $750 or so. And I think that\nwould be a big thing to dissuade them from coming. Could you truly dissuade\nsomeone from coming to Sydney  a pinnacle point in\nthis game we are playing? I feel good about $750. I think that gives\na hefty amount that they have to beat. Yeah  let's do $750. Okay  lock it in? Yep.\nGreat. Alright  let's get on our flight. Welcome to the\ncity of Melbourne in the state of Victoria. So it looks like they're\nat the airport in Sydney. They put down some\nmore money in Sydney  but not a crazy amount. Now  I—\nI think that that was... kind of dumb to go\nall the way back to Sydney just to put down  what  an additional like\n700-something dollars? I saw that on the plane \nand I was just like... I thought they were going\nto put down like $3 000. I think potentially\ntomorrow morning  we head to Sydney. Yeah  it's  I mean...\nGrab it from under them. all of their regions\nare vulnerable right now. I mean  we're one to talk.\nWe just put down a dollar. Well  I think\nTasmania's not vulnerable. Well  no  Tasmania's\nnot vulnerable  but... Alright  we gotta boogie. Alright. Alright  alright \nwe gotta boogie. I think we— I mean \nI shouldn't say anything. Yeah  I wouldn't say anything. (chuckles)\nI'm not gonna say anything. I wouldn't. We're just gonna see\nwhat happens this time. See what happens  certainly. What's fun is that we really \nwith our hats now  we really blend in with the locals. Yes  well  everyone\nwho lives in Australia is issued one of these. Right  that's true.\nI imagine. And we definitely haven't\nbeen getting a lot of looks. Yeah. Alright.\nOff to the city then. Thank you.\nThank you. There  I can frame it up. We've made it to\nFlinders Street station. Which means we have made\nit to the Challenge Board. It's the Challenge Board. Everyone say... yay  it's the Challenge Board. There's some fun ones  Ben. Number one: Race a car\nat Albert Park Circuit. Okay. Basically  we have\nto make a little car  and we have to push it\n35 feet. We get one try.\nOkay. Roll a ball down the\n100 Steps of Federation. Okay.\nThat is a steal. It's a steal.\nA 50% steal. Okay. I don't know that we\nwanna do that right now. I don't know that we\nwanna do it  but it's there. Good to know that it's there. Predict a popular\nBrighton Beach Box. So there are these\nfamous 93 bathing boxes Yeah.\n...on Brighton Beach. And you have to guess\nbetween two of them which one someone will\ntake a photo of first. Okay  that seems doable. And finally  be familiar\nwith your teammates' game. So that's one of us has\nto run like 300 feet  and the other one has to guess how fast they'll do it\nwithin 15%. Okay.\nThat's a 2x. I think we should do the car. I just feel confident\nthat we can achieve this. If we are careful  and we do\na good job building the car  I am confident\nwe can achieve this. It's a long distance\nto send the car  but... I mean  30 feet? That's how far the Barbie was. Yeah  I think it's doable. I think it's doable  but we're\ngonna have to really be careful. Okay.\nI think let's just go for it. How much do you\nwant to put on it? Well  that's the thing. I think if we're\ngonna invest the time  we should really... Make it worth our while.\nMake it worth our while. I think we should\nput down $1 000. How much do we have?\n$1 389. But tomorrow \nwe'll get another $250. Wouldn't kill us. I think we can do this\nif we invest the time. But I think if we're\ngoing to invest the time  we need to make it worth it. (huffs)\nIt's a bit of a risk  but I think let's just\nput in $1 000. I think let's do $1 000.\nLet's just do it and then go. Okay  let's go.\nAlright. (imitates slot machine lever) So we've made it to Canberra. We got the $750 welcome bonus. We're doing good \nand we're going— We're just waiting for\nthe bus into the city. I think the bus is\nabout to pull up. Alright. Alright  Benjamin. Let's go buy some\nincredible materials. Look  we are no strangers to building a little cart\non this show. It's true.\nAnd we've only ever done an awesome job of that. We call it the Mamma Mia. There's an Italian man\nright there  Adam. Don't be insensitive. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.\nThey've got wheels. Now here's the thing. Last time  we made\na huge mistake  and we bought wheels...\n...that swiveled. And this time we will not\nmake that same mistake. Cut to the swiveling wheels. Oh god. We will be buying big \nnon-swiveling wheels. Are we able to find\nan axle of some kind? You know? Well  no  no  no.\nYou don't need an axle  because these are\non their own thing. No  no  well... I worry that those are\ngoing to be too small. What if our car had this? Ah... Just  you keep—\nyou look at these wheels. Let me cook with this\nfor a second. Let me cook. Okay  you cook. You cook. Alright. Okay  this isn't\ngonna work at all. I think this would be perfect. You know what I mean? You get four of these. I think we are... I think there's\nalmost no way to fail. Okay  let's get those. Let's go with this. And let's go. Okay.\nOkay. Shall we set ourselves up... somewhere  or...? Alright. Time for a little bit of a walk. Yeah.\nTo the Challenge Board. One thing that's rather fitting\nabout the Parliament of Australia is that the transit to it... is not very good.\n(both chuckle) Much like the transit\nin much of this country. Yeah  I'm not\nreally sure that they want hordes of tourists coming here. Don't you want\nyour parliamentarians taking the bus to work? They have an\nunderground car park. Now that's fitting. Alright  Toby. Welcome to the\nParliament of Australia. Welcome to you as well. So  I've heard\nyou've been inside here. I have.\nI've met the Prime Minister  Anthony Albanese. I don't mean to boast. That's kind of cool. But  you know  what's also cool\nis we have our challenges. Hopefully these\nare also cool  yeah. Become a socceroo. We have to kick a ball from\n20 feet away into a sock. We have 10 attempts. I am banning physical challenges. Not our style. Challenge 2. We have to identify 10 flags at the International Flag Display. Love it.\nThat's right down there. Mental task.\nWe've been studying. That is our style. Challenge 3:\nRoyal Australian Mint. We have to correctly guess which way a coin\nis going to flip eight times in a row. We have half an hour.\nThat seems tough. Mathematically improbable. Challenge 4  40% steal: Acquire and complete\na jigsaw puzzle of at least 250 pieces\nin 60 minutes. That seems not terrible. I like that one. If they had more money  and I felt like it would\nmake more of an impact... Yeah  their balance\nis quite low right now. So  I don't think that makes sense. I think what makes sense is to go do the Flag Display. We have \nby the time we get there  we'll still have two hours\nin the game day. Yep.\nWe could study a lot. We love challenges\nwhere we can optimise  increase our odds to\nas close as 100% as possible. Doing one of those is\nbetter than a day of kicking a ball into a sock. (metal clattering) Alright Ben  I think we got\n45 minutes max to do this. Time to construct our cart. Imagine that we're like\nan F1 pit crew  right? Maybe we could put— We could have a little\noutfit drawn on us. Or some— don't do that. That's probably going\nto cost too much money. There can be\nno doubt that this was the cheapest saw. This is great. The windy day is actually\nhelping us see the flags. Yeah  and they have\nnames to help us out. Oh  names? Oh  great. Don't look at them for now \nso we can practice. This is the start \nbecause that's Afghanistan at the start  which is A. Oh wait \nthey're alphabetical too? They are alphabetical.\nOh  this is clutch. This is so clutch.\nThis is clutch. This is what I was hoping for \nan alphabetical list  starting with Afghanistan up there.\nThis is so good. So let's make a game plan. So  the fact that\nthey're alphabetical is a tremendous  mega \nunbelievable shortcut. I wanna wager\na lot on this. So how about I go\nstudy that side  you study this side \nand then we come together? Don't expect to\nhear from me anytime soon. Fair enough. Yep  same. Alright  see you in a bit.\nAlright  see ya. Okay  why— It's just\nstopped cutting now. Well  it's 'cause\nyou're hitting the... Oh  I see. We'll cut from\nthe other side first. Well  it's not\ngonna get through. This is unfortunate. Do we think... that we could... Yeah.\nYeah  yeah  I got it. Good enough. So  take a wheel. There you go. I think we got it. Okay  let's get to\nthe F1 track and... and put our car to the test. Oh  now I'm nervous! Don't be nervous. I think we put\nenough sauce on it. That's what F1's all about. It's about a little bit of sauce. It's about how much\nsauce they put on it. And the car itself really\nhas nothing to do with it. It's really mostly about the sauce. Yeah  into the city. So I've done\na couple of practices with no mistakes now. Yeah  that's what I just did. So what I've been doing is... putting an entry for every flag into my mind palace. So I've been associating\neach country's name with some kind of\nmemorable thing. Like a  you know \na common object or something\nthat sounds the same  something very memorable\nand unique. For example  the first one \nAfghanistan. The flag looks like\nkind of like a stamp. So I've been memorising\nit as 'Afghani-stamp'. Bangladesh looks like\na dinner plate  so I memorise it as\n'Bangla-dish'. Albania... bird mania. I've got one for everything. And they're in the\nmind palace and they're ready. Personally \nI just memorize them. Isn't it so sad that we're the ones here \nand not Sam? Sam would be so excited\nto see all this happen. He was so excited\nwhen we put this on. And you know what? You know what I say\nto this  Sam? It's stupid. This is the circuit. I don't think that\nwe can be here. Are the F1 fans satisfied? Let's just... Okay  you see  it's right here. And here we go.\nThis is the real F1 track. I think this way \nso they can kind of see the spans and such. Yeah  let me get\na good shot for you freakin' people. If we get the track \nit's gonna be beautiful. Myanmar  Morocco  Mongolia  Mexico  Mauritius  Malta  Malaysia  Lithuania \nLibya  Lebanon. I reckon we got this. I reckon we've got this. Let's put it all on. Okay. You wanna put it all on? If we're gonna put it all on  then we'll both do\none more pass. 'Cause I wanna do\none more pass. Alright  so let's do\nanother quick pass at yours and then do it  but...\nYeah. I wanna go all in. Okay. I'd like... we got this. All in as in\nevery single dollar? Why not? One. Push. I'm going to push\nforward and down. Forward and down.\nAnd two  I'm gonna not chicken out on how far I— on how hard I go.\n(distant car speeding) Yeah  hold on.\nSomething epic is happening. (car speeding past) Very cool. Let's set the stakes. If this does not work\non the first try... we lose how much money? A thousand dollars. And we have $300 left.\nOne thousand Australian dollars. And... then we're (bleep)-ed. I would say\nwe'd be pretty (bleep)-ed. If we lose this  we are\non the brink of debt. Yes  but... we should not be doing this\nunless we have 100% confidence. Yeah. There's always\na chance I forget one. Yeah. Or mix up one. Yeah. But  with the context\nof order and alphabetization  I think statistical odds are 99.9%. Alright  my biggest worry is that it's going\nto veer really far one way or the other. Yes. We gotta make sure\nthat it's straight  and you got enough  so— Again  it's about the sauce. The sauce is critical. Okay.\nAlright  here we go. It's gotta pass me \nthe finish line. Ready? (wheels scraping) It's getting dark \nand we're losing wind  so we actually have to do it now  because they're\ngetting harder to see. Okay  are you ready? Yes\nAre we going all in? For the lols. YOLO. YOLO.\nThis couldn't go wrong  right? This couldn't go wrong. (rasps) Is this the riskiest thing\nwe've ever done on Jet Lag: The Game? That is $1 243 in. Oh my god. You ready for this? Should I press it? It's you. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Wait  it's you? No  it's Toby.\nNo  it's Toby. Oh  okay. And it's you\nwho could find out not only if Toby\ngets the flags right  but if we manage to do\nthe Formula One car right. You can find that out right now by watching the\nnext episode on Nebula. And one of the things\nthat we do on Nebula is we  every single week \nwe sit down and do our sort of BTS podcast. It's called The Layover. Basically if you want\nmore Jet Lag stuff but without all this\ncrazy video stuff... (shudders) you know  go to listen\nto the Layover podcast and hear about\nall of our excuses for why various things\nthat went wrong are not really our fault. That's true.\nIt's almost never our fault. No  no.\nNo. If you love our voices \nbut hate our ugly mugs  that's the best way to consume\nJet Lag content  but— You could watch the show\nwith your eyes closed. You  well  yeah \nit would be kind of confusing. But you can also go ahead and watch a whole bunch\nof other great stuff that is exclusive only to Nebula by your other favorite creators. I mean  we've got\ndocumentaries on there. We've got a sort of\nprototype version of Jet Lag that was really chaotic. But there's also  there's\nso much stuff on Nebula. You've got Originals\nfrom great channels like RealLifeLore \nReal Engineering  Lindsay Ellis  neo  Mustard. There's simply\nendless  boundless content for you to enjoy on Nebula. Yes  and if you\nwould like to sign up  we can give you\na little special deal if we keep it among ourselves. Because if you go\nto nebula.tv/jetlag  you can get... let's call it 40% \ndoes that sound good? I think  I would go to 40. Yeah  40. 40% off the\nannual subscription  which brings it down to \nI want to say... Math  math  math  math  math. That would be $30.\nOoh  that's pretty good math. That'd be $30 a year.\n$30 a year. Not a month.\n$30 a year. How many is that a month  Ben? Don't ask me. I didn't go to school for that. You did a Math Minute drunk. That's true. Well  I guess that\ndidn't have 30 divided by 12  which equals 2.5. 2.5  that's $2.50. Yeah. And that's not that many dollars. No  it's only two dollars and then another half of a dollar. Yeah  and with that  again  you can get the next episode\nof Jet Lag early. You can get the\nLayover podcast exclusively. You can get all sorts of\nother exclusive content. And you can even help\nsupport us make this show. Because these are the dollars\nthat we use to  you know  pay for very important\nthings like... like wheels. Yeah  we spent\na lot on wheels. I actually don't know if you know how much\nwe spent on wheels. How many Nebula subscriptions\ndid we spend on wheels? We... I feel  I would\nfeel bad if I said it. We spent about 3.5 annual\nsubscriptions on wheels. If you want more wheels  we're gonna need more\nNebula subscriptions. So go to nebula.tv/jetlag\nto sign up. And thank you  because... I don't know how we're gonna\nafford all these wheels. Yeah  our biggest cost\nthis season was wheels. Yeah  okay  bye. Bye!"

        "transcript": "Welcome to episode four\nof Jet Lag: Australia  where it's the end of day two \nand things are heating up. As a reminder \nthe team that controls more of Australia's eight region\nat the end of four days wins. You control regions by\ndepositing money in them  and you can earn more money\nby gambling on challenges. Right now  both teams are in the\nmiddle of high-stakes gambles. Ben and Adam are in\nMelbourne  Victoria  and placed $1 000 on a challenge that requires them to build a cart that will travel 30 feet\nwith a single push. And they only get one try\nto get it right. Meanwhile  my partner Toby and I  who are in the\nAustralian Capital Territory  just bet all of our money  $1 243  on a challenge that requires us to correctly identify\nten flags of the world  and the random number generator\njust picked a sequence in the section that Toby memorized. So now  our fate is in her hands. (sighs) It's you. Heck yeah. You feeling good? Yes. Alright  let's find the ninth flag. And then it's the ten after that. So  the starting flag... is this one. Are you ready?\nYep. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Botswana. Brazil. Open up in the wind. Alright  here we go. It's got to pass me \nthe finish line. Ready? (wheels rattling) Oh  that's it  baby!\nYeah! Ohohoo! Oh  look at how far it goes! F1 champions! Look at how far it goes. We have the F1 champions! Oh  we just won\nthe big F1 race  Ben! Woo  okay! Okay  I think immediately  we deposit $1 000\nin Victoria right now so that we're not\nvulnerable to a steal. We're flush with cash \nwhich is dangerous. We don't want a repeat\nof this morning. No.\nWe've learned. Okay  let's get the money down. Ohh  phew.\nThank god. Brunei. Bulgaria. After that we have Cambodia. Canada. Chile. China. Now that  my dear friends... is Colombia. Alright  let's check our work. This is all or nothing  Sam. This is for the game. Alright. First one. We're correct. Second one  correct. Third one  Brazil  correct. Correct. Correct. Correct. Correct. For the win... (laughs) Chile  correct. Yay! (giggles) Double check the final two. \nI'm really happy. I'm really happy I could do that. China  Colombia \nten out of ten. Ten out of ten. Two hours ago  I didn't\nknow half of these at all. Yeah.\nYou know  not even a faint image. And they say Jet Lag\nisn't educational! Pfft! You wanna know what\nour earnings are  Toby? Oh  I'm excited. What do we got? (giggles) Yes.\nThat's a big number. Yes. Has anyone had a\nhigher balance than this? If it's not the max balance \nit's pretty close to it. Oh my god. Adam and Ben are not\ngonna know what hit 'em. Wahaha! We did it  Ben! He's the best driver\nin Formula One history. Nobody's ever seen\nsomebody drive this good. Red Bull  sign that man! Woooooo! Sam  the rats are gonna\nhate this announcement. And the rats are Ben and Adam because they're from New York. But the rats don't run this city. We do!\nWe do! The last thing that\nwe should decide  I think... before we hit tomorrow morning... I think we should\ntoss some money down in case a steal comes up \nbecause our balance is high. But we can walk and talk. Let's walk back towards Parliament.\nLet's walk back to the spot. This is not a region\nwe want to come back to  because it's hard to get to. Yeah. So we want our deposit to be... substantial. We have seen\njust now the power possible from doing a challenge\nyou're confident on and putting a big bid on. We want to keep... a good amount of money\nin our bank account for any other challenge\nthat we're confident on and we could really...\nYeah. But I'm happy with $750. Okay  so let's pop $750 down in the edge case that they\nare about to do a steal. But I don't see why\nthey would do that. Yeah. Hello! We are back here at\nFlinders Street station. We'll be ending our day here because we want to be\nright here tomorrow morning to see what the challenges are. This is cool. We're ending the night\nin Canberra. Yeah. Just walking back to the\nChallenge Board location so we can start there tomorrow. We talked a lot about a lot of different\nflight options tomorrow. I think the ultimate decision is... we just need to see what\nthe challenges are in Victoria before we really do anything. Yeah  we just  we need to be\nas responsive as possible over these next two days because the fact of the matter\nis just that... regions are going to be\ngoing back and forth between the two teams \nand we just— we don't want to\ntake ourselves out of the game. We definitely played\ntoday slower  but I think we ended up\nplaying it smarter. At least after the bottle thing. And it... seemed to work out pretty well. That was\ndark night of the soul  doing the bottle. But now we've\nmoved on from that. I mean  we're finishing the day\nwith a hefty budget. And a nice deposit here. And a pretty good plan\nof what to do tomorrow. Great.\nI'm feeling pretty good. So  we're just gonna\nwake up tomorrow morning. We're gonna see\nwhat's on the Board. We're gonna see what they do. And we'll see you then. Good night.\nGood night! (smooch) Alright  with day 2 over  marking the game's halfway point  it's time for another rest period. And now  welcome to day 3! Good morning from Victoria! Good morning! My light's not on. And we are so back  Toby. So back.\nSo back. It is day 3  we're in\nthe Capital Territory  and we've got some\nfresh new challenges. You ready for them? Or wait  do we want to... Is there any possibility we're worried about them\ngetting a steal in a second? And Ben  here are\ntoday's challenges. Let's hear 'em. (laughs) Okay. They're all really risky. Find a penguin at St. Kilda Pier. Find an indigenous plane. There's this plane with\nindigenous paint on it. And... sometimes it's at the airport. Predict the train doors. This is a 30% steal\nwhere you have to stand where you think a train's\ngoing to arrive... and line up with the door. And then catch a fish. Which is a 50% steal.\nCatch a fish. You have 45 minutes from\nwhen you start fishing. Look  let me tell ya \nlet me tell ya. Fishing in Australia again... scares me real bad. I did not know that fishing\ncould be this stressful. I will say we did succeed. We did succeed  technically. No  let's take a look\nat the challenges first. Okay  okay. I think we— okay  let's\nlook at the challenges. Okay  first challenge. It's get a hole in one at this\nmini golf course over there. Challenge 2  it's a 2x multiplier  we have to trap a bug\nin Vegemite. Challenge number 3 \nalso a 2x multiplier  we have to do a portrait of\nsomeone in the Portrait Gallery and have the general public\nidentify it successfully. Oh my god  there's a bee! Challenge 4 \n1.5x multiplier  but it's: do a quiz based on what we learn\nat Questacon  the museum. Oh  I love that! I know you're very good\nat mini golf  but... Nope. (bleep) Oh my god. (bleep) (grunts) Oh (bleep) Personally  I don't think\nthat's the one for us. The other three  though \nsound very doable. I like that. Can we acknowledge\nhow lucky we are to be under a hot air\nballoon show right now? This is very special.\nWait  I have to zoom in. Balloons! Balloons. Okay  but back to the game. The war is on. We're going to be going\nfor their territories. They're going to be going\nfor our territories. I think that's right. We think that they have\nleft themselves vulnerable. We think that the regions that\nthey have chosen were a mistake. Yes. Because we can go\npop  pop  pop and take their regions\nso much faster than they can get to our three. I also just\nwant to point out... They  I don't think  have a flight\nout of Canberra right now. And we could steal a lot of\ntheir money if we wanted. What if we invested\nsome extra money... we bought a flight \nand then we did the steal? They have more money\nthan us at the moment. Only question is \ndo we want to dump budget? Sorry  I can't hear you. The only question is  do we want to dump\nbudget on something? We don't want to... We don't want to deposit \nbut that flight. I'll check if that flight\nis still the same price. You don't think\nwe want to deposit in case they steal? I mean  our balance is not\nthat much higher than theirs  but I guess let's think about whether we want to book a flight.\nBecause here's what I feel. I'm quite confident on\nthe Questacon challenge. I think I can do that.\nYeah. And I want as much\nas possible to... It is only a 1.5x multiplier  which is a little annoying. It's not too much  but\nat least the more we bet  the more we can earn on that. Yeah. Questacon doesn't have until 9. Yeah.\nWhich is an hour and a half. We can maybe do\nthe Vegemite until then. Okay. And then\nPortrait Gallery opens at 10 if we want to do that. That sounds like a plan. Alright  well  let's\ngo decide about a flight. Alright. So this morning \nwe could fly to Perth. The problem is we\ndon't necessarily have a great flight back from Perth. We could fly to Alice Springs. There is a good flight\nto Alice Springs. Alternatively  we could go\nfor one of their territories right off the bat. The flights to Brisbane \nI think  are $400. The Sydney ones are almost free. Yeah. Wanna do Sydney\nand then Brisbane? Because we do Sydney \nthen they'll take it back  and we take it back again. Could do that  yeah. Okay  so it seems like we could book\nthat 2:15 flight via Melbourne to Adelaide for $640 for the both of us. Lock it up?\nYeah  let's book that. Okay  let's book it. Awesome  and the\ngood thing about Canberra is that it's not too big. So to get to the location\nof these challenges is not actually going\nto be too hard for us. Not hours of trains.\nWell... Well  the only thing is \nit's all on foot  and the walking distances\nare not nothing. If we want to do\nthe Vegemite challenge  we have to get to a\ngrocery store or something. Yeah.\nAnd the closest one seems to be about a\n20 minute walk away. I think we just start walking. Yeah.\nYeah. Here's the move. The flights to Sydney\nare dirt cheap. So  what we're gonna do... is we're gonna put down\nsome more money here  we're gonna book a flight\nto Sydney  and then  with our\nrelatively low balance  we're gonna attempt the steal. Yeah. We've bought that. That was $202. Okay  we're putting down\nanother $500 in Victoria. And then we're gonna\nattempt the steal. Now... the question is  when do\nwe want to start this steal? Well  yeah \nbecause they  I think  are in the middle of\na challenge right now. Right. It's not totally clear to me \nbut I think they are. If that is the case  I want to see\nif they win the challenge. Right. Because then there would\nbe more money for us to take. The unpredictable... nature of nature and the fact we only have\n10 minutes to complete this does make it quite\na risky challenge. And we said yesterday \nyou know  we're going to be aware\nof these risky challenges and not go crazy on them. Yeah. So I'm leaning towards\na more conservative bet. Look at this. Look at how many ants\nare right here. That's a great anthill. Oh my god  actually \nlook at that. Sam  if you stand there\ntoo long  they're gonna bite you. I am stronger than ants. Before we commit to the steal  we're gonna go down\nto the platform and just see how possible\nit seems to actually do this. Now here's\nsomething interesting. The end of the train has\ntwo doors right next to each other. Okay. So if you line up\nwith the end  you would optimize your chances. It seems like\nthis yellow line here... Is the end of the train.\nIs the end of the train. I think let's just observe. This seems... fairly consistent. The train is almost always\nstopping right at that yellow line. Yeah. Here comes another train. Let's see. Once again  pretty consistent. Pretty consistent. Yeah  that one stops\na little further back  but... Yeah  it's usually\na little more that way... But we still\nwould have gotten it. I think  yeah \nmaybe we just go for it. I actually think\nthis is kind of hard. Yeah  but I mean \nbugs love some Vegemite. Why are you saying that? I've never seen a bug\neating Vegemite. Well  have you offered\nthem Vegemite much? So how much\nshould we put down? I feel good about $500. Okay. You should film yourself\nsaying that to the camera. They can hear me.\nJust in case you're wrong. I feel good about $500. I'm willing to lose $500. Let's do really good.\nLet's take our time then. So are we staking that?\nLock it in. Yep. Alright. There is a great irony with... the fact that... the better— the faster they\ncomplete this challenge and the more successfully\nthey complete this challenge  the better for us. Yeah  it's like I want\nthem to win the challenge and I want them to do it fast. Truly  this time \nunironically  good luck. Could get this. I don't want to have to walk. You just stepped\nover some ants. Oh. They're actually\nall in a line. Actually  this is a long line.\nSee this track? I feel like on one end of this \nthere must be an anthill. Yeah  this is a little... We're following the trail – oh  okay – to the anthill.\n(laughs) I was right. This is a pretty good anthill here. This is a good anthill\nif we want big ants. They're just by a... I think by a grocery store. I think it's gotta be a challenge\nthat they bought groceries for. I mean  but we need to do— I mean  we can't cut getting\nto the airport all that close. No  we don't want\nto miss this flight. If we're going to do this... Again  we need to be\nheading to the airport by about 8:45 \nwhich is in 20 minutes. Yeah  I agree. So I think we\nhave to give them... really  ten more minutes\nto update. Hurry it up  guys! How about  okay... Let's give ourselves\n15 minutes to find smaller ants. Yeah  I'm happy to search. How about let's drop\nour packs down for a second and kinda search this area? And I'm gonna have my snack.\n(bag rustling) What is taking them so long?! Stop dilly dallying! Let's just wait\nuntil the last second. I think the next train\nthat comes through here  we attempt the steal \nand it's just a question of... If they complete it.\nIf they've done it or not. Okay. It's a decent little hole now.\nThat's decent. Don't scare them.\nAnts get scared quite easily. If you move something\nthat was in their trail  they'll run back into the hole. Yeah. Alright.\nYou ready? (sighs) Yeah. Yep  activate it. Okay. Activate? Yep  activate it.\nHere we go. God  I hope this isn't\na different kind of train. Alright. Oh  it feels like\nwe're playing roulette. But these are\nsmaller doors  Ben. I don't think that they are. These are smaller doors.\nOh no. What if the spacing is different? Stop  stop  stop \nstop  stop  stop  stop. Keep going  keep going \nkeep going! It was a completely\ndifferent train. Completely different\ndesign of train. Okay  it's fine. Let's get the hell out of here. Sam... Good news. Sounds like there's\nbeen a failed steal. Wait  really?\nYeah. Heh.\n(giggles) It had to have been the\ntrain door one  right? Must be. (chuckles) Sorry. So they lost... $431 on that. Okay  they're probably\na bit upset right now  so say one nice thing for them. I'm sure you tried really hard. And that's what matters. That was tough. That was tough how that went. That was tough \nbut you know what? That was tough\nhow that went down. We didn't lose that much. And we're still gonna\ngo on the offensive. I think next step\nis to make the slurry. Make a paste that\nis sugar and Vegemite and a little bit of water. Okay. Alright  you wanna\ngive that a taste and see if it seems like\nthe right amount? A taste? Ugggh! Really need to make\nsome money in Sydney. (snaps fingers) Why won't it let us\ncheck in  Ben? I don't know. Having trouble checking in. Hi  it seems that we booked\nat the wrong airport. Well  I wonder when\nwe can go to Sydney now. ♪ Sugar  sugar ♪\n(humming) Oh  we should have\ngotten honey. So it'd be $360 per person? For the 11. Okay  thank you. That's not good  Ben. No. We need to figure\nout a new plan here. We need money. Yeah. Now  maybe we should... Would we be able to\nmake the Alice flight? Yeah  maybe. If we go to Qantas right now. I kinda think that is\nmaybe the move. Yeah  I think we\nmight have to go to Alice. Okay  let's go to the Qantas desk\nand see about that. I think it might be\ntoo soon to book. That flight leaves really soon. Okay  where's Qantas? Qantas is in the\nother terminal  Ben. (bleep) It leaves in 40 minutes. I don't even think\nit'll let us book it. Okay  I think we need to run. Alright  I think we're\npretty much good to go. I think so. Should we give\na tour of our trap? Let's give them a tour. Alright  so we've got\ntwo variant... We've really got three\ndifferent ways of attacking it. So these are our two core traps \nand slightly different approaches. So this one is just the\nVegemite sugar water slurry  with a little bit put on the lips\nto hopefully attract them. This one is the same thing  but we've put soap on the lip to hopefully help them slide down. And then once we get there  we're going to dump\nthis mix into the base as kind of a core moat\nthat hopefully traps them. So for them to get into\nthe main things  we've got... these ramps up to the main traps. We've also got\na trap-to-trap ramp in case they want to\nmake a break for it. A trapeze  if you will. Yeah  mhm. And then once we get there  we'll probably put some\nsticks in the outside. I've got some sticks here to...\nTo give them natural incentive. But I reckon we're good to go. Here goes nothing. Sorry  little guys. (breathlessly) Oh god... Who do we talk to\nto try to book a flight? We went to the wrong airport. We were supposed to\ngo to Avalon. So now we're trying\nto pivot and get on the flight to Alice Springs\nthat leaves in 40 minutes  so it won't let us book. But usually at the gate  you can maybe book us\non a later one and then standby us\nback onto it. Ah.\nWe've done this before. Yep. Do you guys have bags\nto take here? Just these. Just on our backs.\nJust those. So your flight is 40 minutes. So you should make it\nfor your flight. No  but we\ndon't have a ticket. We need to buy a ticket.\nYeah  yeah. Oh  you don't have a ticket.\nDon't have a ticket. Well  yeah \nyou need to buy a ticket. We can't— We don't\ndo the tickets here. You can't buy\ntickets here at all? No  you can't buy tickets. Oh my gosh \nit's crawling up there. He's leaving? He's telling his friends. Oh there  he's coming on.\nOh  someone's already in. It's trapped. It's trapped.\nHe's in. He's in. We got it.\nHe's in. We can confirm that\nhe doesn't leave  but I think— Woah  he's swimming. He's swimming. How is he... Sam  he's swimming. He's an aqua ant. He's out. He's coming out. He's out  he's out of the water.\nOh no. Oh no. He's out of the water. Oh no. Wait  is he though? No  he's... Is he?\nI hate this. I hate what we've done. We can free him. He's had a nice little meal. I reckon he's trapped. Adam Chase. I'm on hold. He said he had five minutes\nto get it done  so... (giggles despondently)\nOh god. If we don't get this flight \nwe're in huge trouble. I think he's officially trapped. I think if we free him now \nhe'll survive. Okay. Quickly  free him. Yes  okay. Here  can you take the camera?\nGo  cut. I'm not sure what happened. The hold music stopped \nbut he's not back. So I'm not sure. What is it? Well  there was hold music \nbut then it stopped. But now he isn't there yet. Okay  alright  of course. Yes! Thank you so much.\nThank you. Sorted?\nYes  we did it. Thank you so much.\nThank you. Okay. Okay. That was nuts. Okay  Adam. Yes?\nSo... Having been kneecapped by fate \nand our own ignorance... We are no longer going\non the offensive. We are instead being forced\nto retreat into the outback. It's true. Where we will grow\nmore powerful than ever before. It's sort of a Dune situation. It is sort of a Dune situation. We're going into the desert\nto amass power after a setback. The desert power.\nSo then... Yeah  we're cultivating\ndesert power  Ben. And then tomorrow \nwe will strike. And we will burn their whole\nterritory to the ground. You want the water? We could keep that.\nNothing bad happened. It's a little Vegemite-y. I changed my mind. Okay  let's go to Questacon. So  they currently hold\nVictoria pretty thoroughly  Tasmania very thoroughly. They really weakly hold\nSouth Australia. We'll go there  we'll claim that. Yeah. So  the question is \nwhat is their fourth region? Kind of  the question really is  where are they going now\nand competing for? We are going to go\nto the outback. We are going to amass our power  and tomorrow  we will strike. And because their territory... all of those regions are together...\nHighly vulnerable  in my opinion. ...it will be super easy to steal\nall of their stuff tomorrow. Yep  right at the end. That's the move  baby. This way. Alright  we're in Questacon. First of all  great name. I don't know what it means. Love the name. What do we want to stake? You're good at science  yeah? I don't know. My only worry with this is the slang quiz that\nAmy did yesterday was a little bit on the harder end? Amy can be a little bit tricky. What's the most\nyou're willing to lose? $1 250  I think. Okay  let's do $1 250. Alright  I'm happy with that. Yep.\nOkay. Lock it in.\nLock it in. Oh  there's a big moon. Wow. Alright  here's gallery one. Oh  yeah. You can see the electric flow. Yeah  yeah. Bigger ball  bigger boost  yeah. It's like Jupiter. (cyclical buzzing) It's good stuff. We're gonna make it. I actually think that\nif we play this right  and we're able to\nearn money in Alice... Yeah. We can win. Alright  I want to\ntest my reaction speed. Go! (clang) Where'd it go? (clanging) I don't know. Take your Instagram shots in here. This set of letters seems random  but it's actually important\nin astronomy. But there's an acronym\nthat I learned at uni to remember them \nand that was: \"Oh be a fine girl  kiss me.\" ♪ Hydrogen  helium \nlithium  beryllium ♪ ♪ Boron  carbon \nnitrogen  and oxygen ♪ ♪ Fluorine  neon \nsodium  magnesium ♪ ♪ Alumin— ♪ That's not a liquid.\nRemember that. This is the Nobel Prize. This is Brian Schmidt's prize\nthat he got in 2011. He was the vice-chancellor\nof ANU when I was there. So he learned that the universe's expansion\nis accelerating. Yes  by looking at supernovas. Get ready for our test. I think I'm ready. I think  as ready as we can be in the amount of time that\nwe want to spend here. Let's find a good spot\nto go do the quiz. Alright. Amy  I hope\nyou've been nice to us. Hope you had fun\nat Questacon. But more importantly  I hope\nyou were paying attention. I'm going to give you\nfive questions  all of which have answers\nthat were inside Questacon. You can pick three of\nthose questions to answer. You have to get all of the\nthree questions correct. Also  shout out to\nTom at Questacon for helping me write these.\nTom  you are amazing. Question one is: Whose Nobel Prize is\non display at Questacon and what is it for? Well  you know this. Brian Schmidt's prize\nthat he got in 2011. Question two: What is the minimum\nnumber of moves required to complete the Tower of Brahma\nwith four discs? Is it A) 9 moves  B) 13 moves  C) 15 moves  or D) 17 moves? I have no idea what this is. That was in that\nfirst room at the top. That was those puzzle games. I didn't really look at them. Oh  yeah. You can see the electric flow. Well  hopefully\nwe don't need this one. I don't even know\nwhat the Tower of Brahma is. I have no idea. Question three: What is the current visitor record on the Speed Ball\nexhibit in Excite@Q  and when was it set? I don't know. I know it was that— It was in the jump room \nyou know? And there was a thing \nand I did look at it. But I didn't really memorise it. Okay  let's hope\nfor the last two. Question four— Why are there two airports\nin Melbourne? That seems silly. Someone should've\ntold us about that. Yeah.\nOr we probably should've— I should have remembered that. Probably should have  yeah. Nonetheless  this is\nnow an even better plan. This is— Because it's—\nWe're doing Dune. Uh-huh  we're doing Dune. We're Dune-ing it. And  I... We're gonna Dune it to them. I haven't finished\nthat trilogy of films  'cause they haven't\nmade the last one. But as far as I know \nit only goes well... Right  everything goes good. For... all.\nEveryone  yeah. Come forward.\nYes  thank you. Look. Here's the thing\nabout gate agents. And I'll go ahead and\ntell you right now. The gate agents' first reaction\nis always  \"I can't help you.\" And then... if you just talk to them\nfor two minutes  then they always\nfigure out a way to do exactly what you were hoping. Because I think\nthe thing is that most people are\nvery  very mean to the agents. And so if you prove that\nyou're nice  then... You know  they let you through. Kind of like  you know \nlike trolls under a bridge. I guess that's mean. Yeah  well...\nBut we're not mean to them. But also usually the troll\ndoesn't let you through if you're nice to them.\nYou have to answer their riddles. What is the name\nof the machine you would use to generate static electricity? A) a Wimshurst machine  B) a Gravitram machine  C) a Harmonograph  or D) the Kraken? Do you know? No. (exhales loudly) The questions are not\nthe kind of questions I thought they would ask. No  they are the\nweirdly specific ones. I thought they would\nask about science facts. The science  yeah. I didn't think they'd\nask about the exhibits. Ugh  okay \nlet's see the last one. Oh my god. Question five  this one is\nnot multiple choice. You just gotta give me\nthe right answer. What are the\nthree types of bees in a European bee colony? Oh... queen... drone... and worker  I think? I studied that one a good bit. Mhm  yeah  I saw you\nat the bee exhibit. So I think we're\nfeeling good about two  and we need a third one. Speed Ball  that— I mean  that's just gonna be\na pure guess  right? This one  that's— Is that just gonna be\na pure guess? Okay  I'm gonna check\nthe last one. Oh my god. Tower of Brahma\nwith four discs. I don't even remember this. What could that be? Four discs. If Tower of Brahma\nmeans Tower of Hanoi  I actually know what\nTower of Hanoi is. It's that kid's toy with the discs. I think it is that. You could work it out. We could... We could try to work it out. I'm making four different\nsized pieces of paper. That's the large one. That's the next size. The next one is half\nthe size of that. And then just a little... While Toby and I solve\nour Tower of Hanoi  quick clarification time. The Tower of Hanoi  also\nknown as the Tower of Brahma  is a game with three rods\nand some number of discs. The goal is to transport\na stack of discs from one rod to another \ngoing one move at a time and never stacking a larger disc\non a smaller disc. Amy wants to know what\nthe fewest number of steps to do this for four discs is. And after some trial and error  Toby and I managed\nto do it in 17. 16.\n16  17. But I don't think that was\nthe most efficient. Four. And all we could do is\nput this back where it came from  but that doesn't make sense. One. That's our fourth move. This isn't... No  I think I went in a circle. Do at least something\nthat feels wrong. 2⁴ is 16  which is\nnot really helpful either. 15  16  17  18. So now we're at 18. That's not right. We're getting worse. We don't have an\nenormous amount of time  so... Yeah. We managed\nto do 17 and we're not even 100% sure\non the rules of the game. I agree that\nit shouldn't be that easy. So it shouldn't be 17. So I think I would go 15\nand hope for the best. And if it's actually 17 \nI will die. Because that is so embarrassing. So we're saying  we know\nthe Nobel Prize one. Brian Schmidt  Physics  2011. We're saying the bees are\nqueen  worker  drone. And this one \nwe're gonna guess 15? Yeah. Should we lock that in? Yeah..? Here are your answers. The answer to the first question\nabout the Nobel Prize is A)\nBrian P. Schmidt for physics. The answer to\nthe second question about the Tower of Brahma is C) 15 moves. (gasps) (shudders) (both sob) Wait  wait \nwait  wait  wait  wait. Check the bees  fam.\nCheck the bees. Yes  yes. Question five. The three types of bees in\na European bee colony are the queen bee \nworker bees  and drones. (sighs)\nYes! I cannot believe we made it\nout of that unscathed. Wait  wait  wait. Not only do we not even\nknow what the game is  we don't even know\nthe word for the game. I can't believe\nwe only got 500 bucks for all that trouble. You want some interesting news? Oh yeah? I think they're\nheading to Adelaide. They're heading to Adelaide? Kinda looks like it. Hello. Well  we're on our flight\nto Alice Springs. But somewhat surprisingly \nwe're also... in The Snack Zone  baby! I didn't realize it was\non the way to Alice Springs  but it turns out The Snack Zone's\nright on the way. The Snack Zone\nwas right on the way. Today we'll be reviewing these\nbeef sausage rolls  which... in— on American\nshort domestic flights  you don't get hot food. Nothing close to real food. This is pretty crazy. That tastes like actual food. And actual food tastes so good. Right now  it really does. Are they at the airport? The tracker is somewhere in between\nMelbourne and Adelaide. Okay  if we want to do\nportrait gallery... Oh yeah  let's go in and out. We only need to quickly see it\nand then draw a picture. Make a recognizable portrait\nat the National Portrait Gallery. Create your own version of a portrait in the\nNational Portrait Gallery. The portrait may not\nhave words in it. Create a Google form with\nthe photo and the question \"Who is this a drawing of?\" The correct answer\nmust be in the top two. You may disregard\nobvious joke answers. Let's just swoop in and then do\nthe challenge at the airport. We would need to\nstake it ahead of time  but I just want to make sure\nwe don't miss our flight. So here's my question. Have you been to this\nportrait gallery? Yeah. Okay  and you feel\nreally confident that there's someone\nuniversally known? Well  to be honest  I'm shocked that you didn't\nknow who Ned Kelly was. Because I think he's\nprobably the number one easiest to draw and most iconic\nif they have him there. But  keep in mind that\nthe respondents are just gonna be random Twitter people\nnot from Australia. The late Queen Elizabeth... is obviously quite easy. I think the Queen\nwould be easy if you're confident that\nthe Queen would be in there. Oh yeah  I'm 100% sure of it. Okay  if you're\nconfident about that. But I think Ned Kelly\nwould be better. I have no idea\nwho Ned Kelly is. He was the guy\nwho wears a tin bucket with a slit in it. Okay  I kinda get that \nbut I'm sorry to break it to you  but I think this might just\nbe an Australian thing. So I'm not feeling tremendously\nconfident about this. I'd also worry about  you know  people who are\npro-Ben and Adam purposefully spiking it. I think Ned Kelly is\nless likely to get sabotaged. I have no idea who that is! What about $750? $750? Stake it  $750?\n$750? We'll lock it in.\nMorning. Are you going\ninto the galleries? Yes.\nYes. Just the backpacks \nput them in a locker. Okay.\nOh  sure. Okay.\nAlright. It says video recording\nis not permitted. So  let's go through. We'll take a photo. And we'll report back\nto the audience. This is absolutely\nincredible  Ben. What's happening? Look  you gotta— The game keeps you on your toes. (laughs) That's for sure. Okay  we left\nthe portrait gallery. That didn't go amazing. And now we also have\nanother issue where there's no way\nto buy bus tickets. And we need to get\nto the airport. We don't have a bus card. We can't pay with\nour credit cards. We're thinking of\nwalking 40 minutes  begging at the bus  or I just\nthought of these scooters. Yeah  the problem is there's\nnowhere within a 30 minute walk to even buy a bus card. While we do that \nI'll quickly summarize what happened at the\nPortrait Gallery. All the portraits were\nweirdly niche. There was no Queen.\nThere was... The most recognizable\nperson I saw was Russell Crowe \nbut that's pretty hard to do through the photo—\nthe portrait. But for now  we're just\ngetting to the airport  and then we're gonna worry\nabout the rest of this challenge once we get there  right? Do you think\nwe can safely do this? Eh  okay.\nI mean  there's helmets. Good bye. Oh  yours is slower? Alright  scooter mission complete. I'll go get tickets\nwhile you lock those. That was  once again... a little tight for comfort. Okay  we have about\nten minutes until our bus. Alright  let's sit down over here. Yeah. Okay. A lot of things\nhappening at once. 'Cause the other thing\nI was noticing is... Ben and Adam's pins... are updating. You notice where\nthat's a line between? That's Melbourne and... an undisclosed location\nnorth of South Australia. And on the way to...? Alice Springs. I think they're\ngoing to Alice Springs. They wouldn't. I... Welcome to the outback. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Timothy Chalamet  is that you? It's me  Timothy Chalamet! I'm the Lisan al-Ghaib! And you could be the\nLisan al-Ghaib if you got a subscription\nto Nebula because you could\nwatch the next episode of Jet Lag: The Game where we go to Alice Springs \nand we do Dune right now on Nebula. That episode is up—\nWe're going to the outback. We're going to the outback  baby. (bleep) these Jet Lag hats  which you can buy for... an amount of money on Nebula. Do you think there\nare any legal implications for saying that we're\n\"doing Dune\"? Nope.\nProbably. Let's hope not. Alright. Anyway. Well  if you want to\nhelp support our legal fees... You can go ahead\nand sign up... for Nebula. And why should they do that? Well  you can— Because they can watch Dune. No. Dune is really not on Nebula.\nIt's not available. You know what it is on Nebula? A bunch of video essays\nabout Dune! And also  the Layover podcast  which is our aftershow podcast where we break down\nwhat went on  what went on behind the scenes  all the stupid mistakes we've made. We talk to Toby. It's the number one\nToby-talks-about-this-show podcast. So  it's on Nebula. And Nebula's got a bunch\nof other great stuff too. Not only  of course  every episode of Jet Lag\none week early  the Layover podcast  our outtakes from each season that\nwe put at the end of the season  our pilot season of Jet Lag  but it's got actually other things\nfrom other people that aren't us  such as Patrick Willems's\ndebut movie  and also an upcoming short film. Abigail Thorn's play  and\nalso a film that she's doing. Jesse Gender's film\nIdentiteaze. Also  Archeology Quest \nand also The Battle for Britain  and also Modern Conflicts  and also Broey Deschanel's\nTaboo on Screen  and also other series. But I can't remember\nall of them right now because there's so many of them! And maybe an upcoming Original where Nebula gave us\ntoo much money to make a show where we kind of\nmanipulate our friends. If you want to sign up\nfor Nebula  we got a pretty good deal for you. Sort of  you're turning\ninto Larry David now. Yeah  not bad. A pretty  pretty good deal. If you go to nebula.tv/jetlag  because that's where\nyou can get 40% off. And 40% off \nthat's $30 a year or so. That's not many dollars. $2.50 a month  $2.50 a month! $2.50 a month \nnot bad  not bad. And that's to get\nnext episode of Jet Lag early  Layover podcasts  all that\nother exclusive stuff. And help support  like \nyou keep these lights on. These lights are expensive. These  specifically \nthese lights are on because of your subscriptions \nthat's true. It actually kind of\ngenuinely is  yeah. Oh yeah  that's a nice joke. This is the studio  yeah. It'd be— These ad reads would\nbe terrible without lights. That's true  you wouldn't\nbe able to see anything. Yeah  so anyways  go to\nnebula.tv/jetlag to sign up and thanks in advance\nfor your support. (smooch) Well  that was really tender. Well  I'm tender\nwith our audience."

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nto episode five of Jet Lag: Australia  where two teams are\ncompeting for control of Australia's eight regions. Right now  the board looks like this \nand the teams are here. My partner Toby and I are\non our way to the airport  on our way to Adelaide \nto steal it from Ben and Adam  who  you may notice  are in\na pretty unusual location. Because of a flight mix-up\nlast episode  they were left with no choice\nbut to retreat to Alice Springs in the middle of the outback\nin order to claim the Northern Territory's\nwelcome bonus. Now  their plan is to\nrack up a huge budget and return tomorrow  the final day  to steal my and Toby's regions. So let's see if it works. It's gonna be hot. Oh yeah  buddy. Oh baby. Welcome to the outback. Welcome  folks \nto the outback. Oh  we can feel it.\nWhere it's so hot that it's crazy. But I tell you what \nit's a dry heat. It is a dry heat.\nIt's a dry heat. It's a dry heat. Who coulda expected? Here's what I'll say \nonce we put our money down here  that means that there are\nseven regions in play. And so if you want to win \nyou're gonna need four of them. That's true \nyou need four to win. If they're going to Alice now  I think we're in a scenario where it's going to be\nseven regions in play. Once we lock up Adelaide \nwe can essentially just follow them. The bus is picking up in one minute \nso let's just get on the bus. Okay  so we were just realizing the best move for\nBen and Adam right now. They could leave a dollar. You know  all they'd have\nto do is leave a dollar in Northern Territory to claim it  and there's no chance\nwe challenge that. That'd be a good strategy. They might secure\nthemselves Alice Springs. Do you wanna go ahead\nand put down a dollar and be in control of four regions? Let's just do it. I'll feel good. Great. I mean  the truth is  I don't know that we... put more than a dollar\ndown here at all. No  no  I—\nBecause I think it's like  the real cost to them\nis coming here. Basically  I don't think\nthat they could win the game by... No.\n...coming here. I think that this is\nkind of a lock for us. Back at the airport. What was your name? Andrew.\nDo you want to say hi? Hello! Nice to meet you guys. Good luck on the challenges \nand I hope you beat Ben and Adam. I appreciate it. We will  in your honor. Real quick reminder. Toby and I are in the\nmiddle of a challenge where we had to go to the\nNational Portrait Gallery and choose a famous person to draw. Our drawing must then\nbe correctly identified by our audience in an online survey. The Portrait Gallery did not have the recognizable people we expected \nlike Queen Elizabeth. So we've been forced to go\nwith a less-known option. Alright  we've made it to the\ndesignated airport drawing location. It's crazy that they have those. Yes  I'm gonna draw. It's not gonna be amazing \nbut I think I can do okay. This is Kathy Freeman\nwinning the 2000 Olympics  I think the 400 metres. So I'm going to try and draw\nthis with the Olympic rings. And then I'm going to\nkind of amalgamate it with this of her carrying\nthe flags. Like  yeah. So I think we—\nI reckon we have 20-something minutes\nprobably to draw. Okay  I'll try to\ndo a good job of it  but really no guarantees.\nYep. (Adam and Ben sigh)\nBen  welcome to Anzac Hill. It's so hot. Let's take a look at the challenges. I mean  I'll go ahead\nand say right now. We need to earn a lot of money. Yeah.\nWe need to earn big money. Ugh  oh  the bugs. (sighs) Collect 100 animal points\nat Alice Springs Desert Park. This is a 2.5x. Basically it just involves\ngoing to this park and finding a lot of animals. I think it's sort of risky. Send a telegraph at the\nNorthern Territory's oldest telegraph station. So we have to go to the\nAlice Springs Telegraph Station  and we have to\nactually build a device that can communicate\nin Morse code. Score a bogey on any hole\nat Alice Springs Golf Club. Now this is a 3.5x. A lot of points. And to sense\nthe passage of time. This is a 3x. We have to\n– without looking at any clocks – wait around for\nexactly a half-hour. Three minutes allowance\non either side. It's a tight allowance. Whoa!\n(chuckles) I've drawn this. I mean  it looks great. It's actually better\nthan I thought  so... I was skeptical to be honest \nbut that's pretty iconic. Alright  take a photo\nof this and post it. Alright  the poll is posted. I can't wait to see\nwhat they say. We're good. It's fine. (sighs) Here's what I'll say. I think the telegraph one \nwith a lot of time investment  we could make almost a guarantee. Yeah. I will also say... I think I could get a bogey. You do?\nI am very bad at golf... but if we have 18 holes\nto get one bogey... I think the odds are very high\nthat I could do that. And it's a 3.5x. I played golf once. Yeah  were you good at it? I don't remember. Mm  okay. Check this out.\nThis is Qantas' brand new A220 that's painted in that\nsort of indigenous design. There's only one of these \nand it's such a cool design. I love it. Interesting. We got it. I think  usually you can\npick it up on the next line. Do we want to deposit\nany more here? Well  how do you feel? (sighs)The strategy would say  we don't need it  I think. Same feelings for me. I think I'm leaning towards\njust leaving it alone. Alright. Okay  here's the thing. If we want to win... right now  I think\nthey are about to go... probably to South Australia\nand take it. That's gonna put them with four\nand us with three. Tomorrow  I think we  if we want a solid\nchance of winning  I think we need to be able to\nclaim at least two of theirs. Two  ideally three of theirs. If we want to\ntake New South Wales  we need $1 200.\n$1 100-something. Brisbane is $1 340-something. And it seems like\nthey are going to be leaving the Capital Territory\nwith not that much. It's going to cost $1 300\nto get out of here. It's expensive. I think we need\nroundabout $4 000 between now\nand the end of the game. That doesn't mean\nwe have to make it all here or make it all today.\nMhm. But we need to get started. I'm sort of of a mind... that we bet a lot on\nthe telegraph. And we lock that in... nail it. That's our cash builder. And then with the cash\nwe earn from that  we bet big on golf. Yeah.\nThat's kinda where I'm at. The desert park  I just— I don't like when stuff's\nout of our control. What are the only\nchallenges we've failed? The ones that were\nout of our control. It's true.\nIt's 'cause we're so good. But I'm serious! Oh  a bug went in my nose. There's so many bugs. A bug went in my nose. I think $600. 600 bucks. Okay  let's do that. It is a way down. Okay  the bus can take us\nstraight to a Bunnings. Supposedly... the bus will come in eight minutes. Alright  great. Big win for\nAlice Springs' transit network. (indistinct)\nOh  okay. Thank you.\nHave a good day. Alright. Alright  Benjamin \nwe're back at Bunnings. Back at Bunnings  look. Now  we were talking about how exactly we want to\nbuild this telegraph. And we essentially think\nthat what we need to do is we need to make a device that's just like a tube\nthat can transport objects. Yep.\nAnd then we have to have an object that represents\na dot  an object that represents\na dash  and an object that\nrepresents a break. And if we are able to\ndo that  I don't see... there being any way to\nmisinterpret that signal. Nope. Famous last words  but... it should also be\npretty easy to build. Yes. We just need to\nget a tube. This could be our... I do not trust that\neven a little bit. Stuff's gonna get stuck in that. Not a chance. No  the hole's... Literally not a chance.\n...a little small. Not a single chance\nin the world. Alright  alright.\nNo. This is what I'm talking about. Yeah. This is what\nI'm talking about. Oh  yeah. Do you think that's ten feet? It's nine feet and ten inches. It's kind of annoying. I guess we could put\nlittle extensions on it. Yeah.\n(tube bwomps) And now we just need to find what we're gonna send through. Look at these rainbow pebbles. Yeah. And then we determine \nyou know  one to be a dot and\none to be a dash. Alright. The unfortunate truth is that we have to hike a mile\nto get there. You know what? It's fine.\nWe've got our telegraph  and we are going to hike\nit into the outback. And there  I think we've got\nthis challenge on lock. I think  frankly \nthe biggest risk is that we die. Where are they  by the way? Last I checked \nthey were at the airport  but it seems like they've\nbeen there for a long time. If I were them  I would've taken\nthe 2 pm to Adelaide. Uh-huh.\nWhich we  frankly... don't have a very good\ngrip on right now. But who knows? Who knows\nwhere they could be going. Out into the outback... mate! The bugs  they love my orifices. See  remember\nbefore we were saying that we were doing Dune? Yeah.\nRight? We were going into the desert after a bit of a defeat\nto cultivate desert power and emerge  you know \nvictorious. And this  Ben \nthis is Shai-Hulud. This is the desert worm\nthat is going to lead us... into... into victory. (spits) Ugh. A bug went in my mouth. We're getting there. I think\nit's only ten minutes left. Adam  do you feel like\nyou're accumulating desert power? I feel like\nwe are accumulating quite a lot of desert power\nat the moment  Ben. That's good  because\nI've eaten like five bugs. Yeah... Wait  have you really\neaten them? I mean  look \nthey've gone in there. Who knows what happened.\nEugh! (spits) It just sort of doesn't end. Oh  is that it? Maybe. It's gotta be it.\nYep. Now  where is\nthe historic building? Oh  we could ask at the cafe. Yeah. Hello  okay  so... we've been informed that we can't actually film\nthe telegraph building  because it's a heritage site. So go ahead and\nlook up a picture of it. It's pretty cute. Anyway... We're just gonna go ahead\nand do it right outside. Okay  now  Adam. Okay. Blue will be a dot \nand red will be a dash. And I'm gonna take\na nice big long pause between each of\nthese things. Yep  can't wait. Tell me when\nyou're ready. I am... ready. Here we go. (beads rattling) Dot  dot. Dash. Dot. Okay. You're taking a long pause. I'm going to assume that\nthat means that's a letter  and dot-dot-dash-dot\nis F  okay. Dot-dot  I. Dash-dot  N. I don't know if\nI'm allowed to talk  but the number of flies\non my head... There's so many flies \nit's insane. (bead rattling) (moans) It's because I'm not\nmoving that much. Dot. Oh  they're going\nin my ears. Dash. Dot-dash is an A. Okay  dot  dash... (tube twanging) ...dot-dot. Dot-dash-dot-dot is L. Ben  is the word\n'final'? Yes  sir  it is. (exhales sharply) Okay  minor crisis averted. Okay. Okay  the one thing that\nwe should say  for clarification... The reason why we're not\ndepositing anything here is because we're not allowed to when we're on a connection. It's treated as if we're\non one long flight. Very possible we come back here as the next thing to do.\nYeah. But  we're not\nallowed to leave anything. Which is unfortunate \nbut them's the rules. It'd seem that Ben and Adam have managed to get\nthemselves a few coins. Yeah  a few dollarydoos. I think the thing that we need\nto focus on now is just... knowing that they're not\ngoing to leave Alice Springs until  at best  tomorrow midday. What is our best strategy\nto counteract that? Hi there. Yeah  that would be great. I'm just waiting for my friend. But this is hugely helpful. How long have you been\nliving in Alice Springs? (chuckles) Thank you very much! Thank you! Well... Well  you told me to stop! (laughs) The driver had a lot\nto tell us about... how you can cure cancer\nwith vibrations. A lot of science going on. We're just gonna check out\nthe golf course here and see. Hi there. No. Oh  shoot. Okay. We can wait. We can wait  yeah. Okay  great. Can we get some balls\nfor the range? Yeah.\nAnd then we'll rent clubs. Okay. Alright  let's\nset it up in the shade. The question is \nhow much do we bet? I mean  here's the thing. I think if we really want\nto get back in the game... Yeah. We have got to put a\npretty sizable bet on this one. I agree  and this is 3.5 \nso it could be huge money. I am bad at golf \nbut I have played golf. I am as good at golf\nas you would expect. I think we should do $900. $900? I mean  it's \nI don't know  Ben. I mean  it's a risk.\nIt's obviously a risk. I just  you know  there— We're gonna have to\ntake a risk now or we're gonna have\nto take a risk later. I think we have\nto take the risk now. We have time. We'll take our time. We're gonna go to the range. We're gonna practice our shots. We're gonna go\nto the putting green. We're gonna get prepped. And then just one bogey. Alright. This is a new vehicle for Jet Lag. Oh  man. So  I can tell you the basics. Yeah.\nLined up with the ball. Both hands. Just make sure you don't... So that was not great. You need to control the club. You need to be in charge of it. Okay.\nDoes that make sense? I'm in charge of you. Keep down on it. Oh  lookit.\nThat went real far. Look  let's be honest. I'm not getting this for us. Yeah  that's true. Okay  I'm gonna go\npractice some putting. 'Cause putting is my weak spot. Too little and then too much. That's pretty good. Alright. Adam's just doing some\nlast-minute practice before we go. I really cannot articulate the stakes of this\nto him explicitly because he seems to be... frighteningly relaxed about this. Which is actually... Usually... he's freaked out. And so he's actually\nso relaxed that I'm scared. But I don't want to\ninterrupt this zen state. You ready? I'm all set  I got it.\nAlright. We got this. You want to commence? This is a huge gamble. But I think that I can do it. No problem. The spirit of my father \nTodd Chase  is going to flow through me. Yes. And I am going to get...\na bogey. It's kind of like Star Wars \nbut a lot whiter. Here we go! Alright  Ben. This first hole is a par 4 \nbut it's a short par 4. It's a great opening opportunity. Par 4  so that means that\nwe need to get it in five. Yes. To get a bogey  because\nI know what a bogey is. Where are we trying to hit it? See the flag up there? I'm just going to not overdo it. Not gonna overdo it. I'm lined up. It's like Wii Golf. (clean strike) That's okay. It's in the sand\nover there. We're gonna hope that\nwe can find that. Okay  I think we can. That is not disastrous. It should be somewhere\naround here  I think. You see anything? ...No. Could really be\nkinda anywhere around here. It's right here. Okay  good job. It's kinda in this\ntall grass a little bit  which might be\nproblematic. It's okay. I'm gonna hit...\na six iron. Six iron  that's exactly\nwhat I would have recommended. I'm just gonna go for it. Stay down on it \nnice clean hit. (club strikes) We can work with that. It's not a super strong\nhole so far  but we can work with this. If we could get this\non the green... we could have a shot. You got it. (club strikes) Oh  that's good. That's good.\nMight be too far. No  that's quite good. I'm very pleased with that. Yeah  good job. We are on the green  Ben! Oh  we're on the green! We're on the green\nin three. This is very good. It's a very good start. Now  if I can just\nget this in  in two  we'll be all set. I think one thing\nI really want to do is not overhit this. Okay... here we go. (club taps) That's okay.\nThat's not bad. So if we get it in\non this one. Get it in on this \nthen this is it. I mean  it's so close. Just really take your\ntime with this one. There's wind. We might even want\nto wait for the wind to— No  no  that's okay. Okay  okay. Yeah!\n(both laugh triumphantly) Aaahh!\n(cackles) (gritted giggle) Yes! (giggling) Let's go! Yes  yes  yes  yes! Oh... my god  Ben! First hole. First hole! Couldn't have done it better. (grunts)\nCouldn't have done it better. (wheezes exhaustedly) Well done. Our first order of business\nmight be... booking a flight\nthe hell out of here. Yep. Okay  we want to take\nthe 10:20 to Brisbane? We're back in it now. Sam and Toby... Wow  you should\nbe really afraid  guys. We are coming for you. You should be really afraid. Alright. Sam?\nWelcome— Oh  were you about to\nwelcome me? I was just gonna say  big news  big moves\nare happening. Oh  but also \nwelcome to Adelaide. Anyways  we're in Adelaide. Yeah  and I did notice\non the tracker  it seems like they've had a\nfairly successful round of golf. Oh yeah  they got\nreally rich all of a sudden. I did a little bit of\nop research. Both of their flights\nout of Alice tomorrow... Have you seen\nthat they've booked one? No? They just spent some\nof their newfound riches. Oh  I was researching\nhow expensive they were. (stammers) It said\nthey spent $700 a piece. So a combined $1 400. It's probably this one. They're probably going\nto Brisbane then. Oh. We're going to Brisbane. Ben  this rocks so much \nit's hard to express. Okay  well  it looks like... Sam and Toby\njust landed in Adelaide. Adelaide? Okay  so they did\nconnect in Melbourne. Can they get out of\nAdelaide today? Maybe  probably  right? Because if I were him  I would\nnot leave the Adelaide airport. I'd put down $2. So  anyway \nlet's get on the bus and see what the challenges are.\nAlright. Should we... deposit $2? Just for the lulz? Should we do it now  or\nshould we do it in the morning? I think we should do it now\njust for the lulz. Okay  we can put $2. Alright  I'll send $2 for the lulz.\nShould we say hi? We now control... four regions. We're now fully in the lead. This is feeling good. Mhm.\nI like this. J1. Alright  well... Adam  we're heading out. We are. We really don't have\nanything left to do today  because there's only\ntwo more challenges here. One of them terrifies us  and the other \nthe park is going to close. It's also worth noting that... it looks like they've just stolen\nSouth Australia from us. Which was kind of inevitable. We left it as vulnerable\nas it could be  but... But again  the key is... we made them go there. So they had to deal with the\ninconvenience of getting there. Now they have to deal with the\ninconvenience of getting out. Because we learned... Maybe they found a\ngood flight  but... Adelaide is a\n(bleep)-ing death trap. That was what we found. It's a nice-looking downtown. Wait  wait  wait. I've always wanted to do this. Ben and Adam have been here. It's a Jet Lag reference. I know  I got it. Anyway  challenges\nare generated. Let's take a look. Alright  first one. It's a 2.5x multiplier. We gotta find 5 different fish\nin 5 minutes at Port Noarlunga Reef. Good if it wasn't\nso late in the day. Yeah  that could be tough. Second one  2x multiplier: smuggle sugar in—\nto the Sugarloaf. Similar deal. Third one  master the\nDewey Decimal System. 2.5x multiplier. We can do that. Maybe if the library\nis still open. Last one we might\nbe able to do  it's a 2x multiplier: predict a point\nof beach volleyball. Anyway  let's... How about let's sit down and... Closes at 7 pm \nthe city library. It's— We could walk there. Wait  okay. The Adelaide City Library. 12 minute walk.\nLet's start walking. Okay  we can start walking \nbut do we even want to do that? I do. Yeah?\nYeah? I'm... I'm not convinced by the odds. Let's get to Anzac Hill. Oh. Oh  keep going.\nI saw a cool lizard. ♪ Hello  lizard ♪ ♪ You're molting  good job ♪ Okay. Hey  Ben  maybe this is crazy. But I feel like\nI might have an idea of how to do the\nwait 30 minutes thing. Listen to me\nwalking right now. It's pretty consistent  right? Let me— Let me—\nLet me cook on it. Let me cook here. This challenge\nactually is easy  because you only have to go to\nthe alphabetical author's name. There's nothing more to it.\nI guess  but couldn't it be in multiple different sections? It'll be in the\nfiction section  I guess. But what if there's\nspecifically... an Australian fiction section? Considering it's a\nfamous Australian book. And we only have three minutes. Why is it three minutes?\nThat's r— Because that's the challenge. Master the Dewey Decimal System. Visit any local library. From the moment you\nstep foot inside  you have three minutes to find a\ncopy of the famous Australian novel  Picnic at Hanging Rock\nby Joan Lindsay. You may do general research about the Dewey Decimal System\nor the book  but not about the library itself. It sounds like\nyou want to attempt this. Yeah? So do you know\nwhere we would go? No  I've never\nbeen here before. But we just need to go to L. L for Lindsay. I mean  how much\nwould you want to put down? What are you comfortable with? I mean  up to you. I'd be comfortable\ngoing up to $250. How are there\nthis many stairs? I thought we'd walk up\nfive stairs. Not ten flights of stairs. Okay. I just don't want\nto get out of my rhythm. Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah. Okay  hello. So  on our way back\nto Anzac Hill  we realized... Or Adam realized at least that he was walking in\na very rhythmic pattern. And we realized that... a really good way to do\nthe time travel challenge would be by timing steps. Sense the passage of time. Start a timer. Both teammates may not look\nat any clocks or timers until you stop this timer. You may not consult any\nregularly scheduled thing to use as a makeshift clock. You succeed if you stop this timer within 3 minutes of\nthe 30 minute mark. So I have a\nvery consistent gait. So I walked for a little bit \ncounted my steps  timed it  did the math. I walk 1.84 steps a second. So  five minutes \nthat would be 553 steps. I just walked 553 steps. I stopped the timer at\n5 minutes and 1 second. So...\nPretty good. That was almost\nno margin for error. We have a\n10% margin for error. Yeah. We're pretty flush\nright now with cash. We need more of it. How much do you want to\nput down on it  yeah? It's time to put your money\nwhere your mouth is. I mean  I want to\nput down at least $1 000. At least $1 000? I'm gonna nail this. I'm going to crush this  Ben. (laughs) Okay. Okay. I  honestly— I would feel comfortable\nbetting $1 500 on it. Oh my god. Let's put $1 000 on it. $250. You're happy with $2.50? Yeah. Well  it starts\nthe second you walk in here. You have to help  okay? Yeah.\nL-I-N-D  fiction. Okay  you ready?\nYeah. Okay  this is looking good. I see an L. Oh  this is looking good. Okay  this is easy. L-I  L-L. L-E. LIN  LIN. It's gonna be here \nit's gonna be here. It's gonna be here.\nCan you see it? L-I-N. Can you see it?\nIt should be right here. We've got $1 000 on it? Yep.\nAlright. Okay  whew. I'm admittedly a little\nnervous about this. If we win this  I think\nthe game may be ours. Okay. Okay. When you're ready. Go! They might have\nput it somewhere else. Go look for Australian fiction. Okay. There's The Secret\nof Hanging Rock. I'm trying to see if\nthey have a large print. What's this category? This is large print. Maybe they have\na version that's famous. No  it's not.\nIt's not on this shelf. There's LIN there.\n'Kay  found it. I don't know why it's not here. Oh  it could be in Young Adult. Go to Young Adult. Okay  we only have 30 seconds. Go  go to Young Adult. I don't know where it is. Teens. It would have been here. Sam  it would have been here. We got five seconds. L  L. Quick  quick  quick. Get L as soon as you can. We're done  we're done. Time's up. It's gotta be here. Well  time is up regardless. (sighs) Well  that's that.\nI mean  onto the next thing. I'm sorry.\nI'm sorry that happened. No worries. (muttering count) ...48  49  50  51  52... ...four  five  six... ...95  96  97  98... ...67  68  69  70  71... What now? So  my thinking about tomorrow... We're sort of in the same\nbudget realm as them. And therefore I think we\njust need to be very smart about how we use our budget. It does look like \nfor what it's worth  they're down to $1 264  but it looks like they're\nin the midst of a challenge. That tells me  to be honest... I think they're\nplaying pretty riskily if they're staking\n$1 000 on a challenge. 95  96  97  98  99  100  one  two  three  four \nfive  six  seven  eight  nine  ten  eleven \ntwelve  thirteen... I think the best strategy\nis probably to be... responsive to what they do. Mhm. I mean  in my mind \nit's really just between... Well  it really is between\nthree things actually. Do we go to Brisbane  and there's\none clear flight at 10:30? Do we go to Victoria first thing? Or do we just give ourselves\nmaximum flexibility by staying downtown \nnot booking anything... and just seeing\nwhat happens in the morning? Because you know  if there's\na great challenge flop... then it is maybe quite nice\nto do the challenges  boost our budget to\nsome crazy amount  and then just\ndot-dot-dot around. Well  this is the only place where we'll ever be able to do\nanother challenge because... Yes  because we don't\nwant to spend time— Anywhere else we go \nwe don't want to be going in and out. Yeah. How much budget\nthey have in in the morning  how much budget\nthey earn in the morning will tell us a lot\nbecause that'll tell us what flights they can afford \nwhat deposits they can afford... and all sorts of\nstuff like that  so... I lean towards\nmaximum optionality. I agree.\nStay in the city. Because— I agree\nbecause I think... I think we have a lot of\ngood options tomorrow. But it's not like we have\na clear path to victory. There's so many uncertainties. So  it's a lot down to\nhow their challenges go. Let's keep our options open. Alright. There's a huge pool\nof options. We don't know what we're doing. We don't know\nwhere we're going. So... But I hope their challenge\nis going poorly right now. I'm sorry. ...Yeah. 93  94  95  96  97... (muttering count) ...98  99  100... Get ready. ...15  16  17... Stop! Ben  Ben. Oh my god. Alright  I'm counting\nin my head. (cackles) (laughs heartily) Get absolutely got! I was at—\nI was at 27 minutes. You would have lost. Yeah  yeah  just barely. Oh my god! That's insane. That's insane. So Ben  what is that? $3 000? That's a cool $3K in the bank. And Ben  we now have\n$4 264. With our flight already\nbooked to Brisbane. That is enough for us to do\nthe whole run tomorrow. And steal all three of\ntheir territories  I believe. What'd I tell you? It's the desert power. We harnessed the desert power.\nAs in Dune. As written in Dune.\nWe have cultivated desert power. Ben  the amount of\ndesert power we've cultivated... Unbelievable. Dune. Dune. Dune! Dune! Dune!\nDune! Dune! Dune! Dune! Dune! Dune!\nDune! Dune! Dune!

        "transcript": "Welcome to the final day and grand finale of\nJet Lag: Australia. Right now  both teams have\nplausible paths to victory. Toby and I are starting\nthe day in South Australia with four regions under our control  enough to secure the win\nat the end of the game. As long as we successfully\ndefend our territory  or make an equal number of trades  the win is ours. Ben and Adam \non the other hand  are starting the day in\nthe Northern Territory with only three regions  but thanks to some\nhuge wins last night  they have more money than us and a flight already\nbooked to Brisbane. If they can use that money\nto flip more of our regions than we can flip back \nwe're toast. It's all going to\ncome down to strategy  anticipation  and clever timing. So  without further ado  day four. Good morning! Good morning and\nwelcome to the final day of season 10 of\nJet Lag: The Game. It is 6 am in the outback. And it is time  7 o'clock. Let's go. Very confusingly\n30 minutes off. Now you might be thinking  \"Oh  well doesn't\nthe game start at 7:30 am? That doesn't make any sense.\" Yeah  because this is\na half-hour time zone. We're an hour and a half\nbehind Sydney. Makes no sense.\nMakes no damn sense. But you know\nwhat does make sense? The beautiful sunrise. That makes a lot of sense\nto me. And also our plan. And also our plan \nwhich is a very good plan. Our plan is very good. I have been... crying  screaming \nand throwing up over the fact that they won\n$3 000 late last night. Yeah  it looks like...\nIt's really  like... Looks like they had... ...concerning.\n...a lot of cool adventures  yeah. That made me a little ill \nnot gonna lie. Well  yes.\nBut keep in mind that no matter\nhow rich they are... they're only going to\nhave six hours after they get to Brisbane\nto do whatever. And after I calmed down\nfrom that shock  I realised we still have\na pretty good chance at victory. I don't want to give\ntoo much away... but we're going to Brisbane \nas you know. And then we have a plan to flip\ntwo more of their regions. Yes. Essentially  we think\nthat we can flip three regions that they\nare currently holding. They are probably\ngoing to try and steal two of our regions today: Brisbane and one other. And all we have to do is steal those two regions\nback from them. And... if you're doing the math \nthey're up by one region right now. Yep. So if they can flip\nthree regions... Then they win.\nThen they'll win. But I don't know that\nthey can do that  Ben. If they earn more money today \nthings get worse. But if they have the current\namount of money they have  they don't have enough\nto get three of our regions. We have an endgame that\nI'm pretty excited about. Yeah. And I don't know\nif they've thought of it. But  this is all to say... I don't know what flights\nthey could take. I don't know what steals\nthey might get. A steal would really blow\nthis whole thing. A steal could set us back. Because a steal\ncould take  you know  upwards of $2 000 from us. And that would mean\nthat we would have to... Yeah  that could basically\nblow this whole thing. So  that's something\nthat  you know... we're hoping doesn't happen.\n(cracks up) Yeah  but I think\nthe first thing to do is... we can make our budget\na little more steal-proof... by taking a look at\ntoday's Challenge Board. Should we check out\nour challenges? Yep. First one  1.5x multiplier: Identify chocolates at\nHaigh's Chocolate Factory. Probably not gonna be open\nfor a while  unfortunately. Yeah. Number two... 30% steal. We gotta have them\npick up and take a wallet that has $50 in it\nwithin 10 minutes. The third  complete 10 obstacles\non the MegaClimb. For 2.5x  that probably\ndoesn't make sense. And the last one \n1.5x multiplier: dump one ocean\ninto another ocean. Also probably too time consuming. I think  to me  the only thing\nworth considering... is the steal. Let's take a look-see. Teach from afar at the\nAlice Springs School of the Air. Okay  so the Alice Springs\nSchool of the Air is this cool thing where\nthere's radio school because a lot of\nthis region is so sparse that they can't have regular school. \"Sail\" across the Todd River. So the Todd River is\nfamous in Alice Springs for not having any water.\nYes. So  \"sailing' across it\nwould mean we would have to build \nbasically  a cart. Master the Dewey Decimal System. You have to go to a library  and you have three minutes\nto find this certain novel. That's a 2.5x.\nOkay. And then get upcharged. So  in this one \nyou have to go buy an item  and then go to another store  and find the same item\nfor more money. And that's a 2x.\nMm-kay. Here's the thing  look. We have enough money\nto do what we need to do. We should not risk any of it unless we are\nvery  very confident that we're not going to lose it. Now talk to me\nabout the steal. What do you think\nabout the wallet? How about let's go\nunder that cover there and get out of the rain\nwhile we discuss? The steal is basically\nthe only thing we'd reasonably want\nto consider right now. If we keep\nthe amount of money that we have right now \nI think  based on... you know \nyesterday's flight prices that we'd have about\n900 spare dollars. And well  30% of our money\nis more than $900 right now. Yeah  so I don't... ...personally love the idea\nof risking our buffer. But what do you think? I don't think we need it. There are certain situations where if we were... not in as strong of a position\nright now as we were  where we would want\nto take that risk. Yeah. But I think we're in a\ndecently strong position  so... I at least think it doesn't\nmake sense to do the steal now. No  I agree. I think we should do it\nif they get any more money. But we have enough money.\nWe have enough money. We don't need to take any risks that we— that are unnecessary. (sighs) I mean  the truth is  I think we could do\nthe Todd River thing. I think we could. I think maybe we should go\ncheck out the Todd River  get more of a vibe. Yeah  let's go examine it. And you know what? Then we can tell you\nabout the river  at least  because it's pretty interesting. Let's pretend... ...you're us \nI'm Ben and Adam  and let's wargame it. I think their winning move would be to put a decisive\nclaim on Queensland that we can't beat. We can't really afford to have\nany of our cities stolen today that we don't get back. If they go to Brisbane\nand match us... with their current budget \nthey'd have $2 900 left over. You're saying what if they put\na bunch of that on Brisbane? If they  yeah \nso if they put an amount that we cannot match\non Queensland... Yeah. They can't do that unless... Unless they get a lot more.\nUnless we can't get from here to Queensland for... $900. Because they— Okay  assuming they\ndon't earn more money  they'll have $2 900 in Brisbane. We have $3 800. So we can match this\nin Brisbane as long as we can get a flight\nto Brisbane or Gold Coast for $900. And assuming they\ndon't earn more money. Yeah. If they earn more money\nthis morning  a lot of these plans are\na lot more dubious. They're back at the river. What does that mean? I still kinda feel like\nyou could get stuck. Yeah  it's... I mean... It's... not very solid ground. And at least here... The river is pretty wide. Yeah. I personally don't feel\ngreat about doing this in time to make our flight. I mean  I'm just saying \nif we don't earn more money  then a steal could ruin the plan. I mean  we need $4 027\nto execute on the plan. I guess the point\nI'm making is the amount of money\nwe would have to risk on a bet right now... in order to put us\nout of the steal... scary zone... Mhm.\nis more... If we then lost that money  we wouldn't have enough\nto execute on our plan. Yeah. Okay  let's don't do it. I think we're fine. If they hit us with a steal  we could earn back\nenough money later that we can still make\nour plan work. It would be a little tricky \nbut... doable. And good content. (sighs)\nWe love good content. So  Ben and Adam\nheaded off to McDonald's. But back in South Australia  Toby and I could not figure out\nwhat they were possibly up to. And anticipating their next move\nmattered to us a lot. We were pretty sure\nthat Ben and Adam only had the time and money\nto make it to Queensland and one other region\nwe controlled. So our plan was to fly to\nMelbourne  flip Victoria  and then fly to one\nof those two regions to steal it back before\nthe end of the game. This plan  however \nhad one big weakness. If Ben and Adam managed to\nmake even more money today  they might be able to put down\nbig enough deposits that we wouldn't be able\nto steal that region back. That meant that we needed\na big cash infusion now  and there was only one way\nwe could guarantee it: put all of our money\n– every single dollar – in the ocean challenge. This would involve taking\nat least 6 ounces of water from one ocean\n– the Pacific  Indian  or Southern – and dumping it in a different ocean\nby the end of the day. Theoretically  we could scoop up\npart of the Southern Ocean here  dump it in the Pacific Ocean\nwhen we get to Melbourne  and secure enough cash to compete\nat the very end of the game. We were confident we couldn't fail. But doing this meant\nlocking up all of our budget until we got to Melbourne. So if Ben and Adam did\nsomething unexpected  or could somehow steal\nmore regions than we anticipated  we wouldn't have\nthe flexibility to change course for the next six hours. So  okay  so... I think it makes sense. Just the idea of... plotting out our\nentire game day now... ...has me scared.\n(titters) I'm shaking because\nI can't even type... I can't even type\ninto Google Maps because I don't know\nwhat to do. I'm very scared \nbut I think we should go. (sighs) I agree... I agree. We're either gonna\nwin or lose on this. That's kind of how everything\ngoes today  but yes. Let's go to the beach. They're at McDonald's. McDonald's?\nYeah. What are they doing there? Probably getting a snack\non the way to the challenges  which is good. Oh  you think\nthey're in The Snack Zone. So  on the map it shows us \nyou might say  \"Okay  oh  they're in\nthe Northern Territory.\" But if you look at\nthis other map... it actually shows us\nright in The Snack Zone. So welcome to\nThe Snack Zone. We're gonna be trying the... Hot Cross Bun\nwith Cadbury chips. Ow. That is bread\nwith chocolate in it. Yeah.\nFor sure. Or maybe\nThe Breakfast Zone  but... Do you see what\nmy earrings are today? Do they look good on me? That's the opposing side. You're supporting the enemy. Oh  no  no. Everyone loves\nThe Snack Zone. It's the premier snack show. What about Choo Choo Chew? Are you eating? What does that\nhave to do with it? I know that the map says\nthat we're behind  but I don't feel that way. No  the map... The map is misleading you. The map... The map doesn't really\nunderstand our desert power. Yeah. The map doesn't sort of have\na metric for desert power. No.\nWe have a lot of desert power. Well  actually \nlet's add that to the map. Graphics team \nadd a desert power meter. A desert power— yeah  yeah.\nAnd put ours pretty high. Theirs is—\nTheirs is almost— It's in the— It's nothing. You'll see the graphic. We have a lot of desert power.\nThey don't have very much. Yeah.\nIf any. And actually \ncould we keep that up for the rest of the episode  in the top— bottom right  the desert power meter? Yeah. For the rest\nof the season  that's the metric you're\ngoing to be wanting to watch. Yeah. Welcome to the beach. Smells like the ocean. Yeah. Which ocean in particular\nis that  Sam? Can you smell it?\nIt's a distinct flavour. Yeah  it's giving... It's giving Southern Ocean. Oh yeah  I smell a hint\nof Antarctic air in there. Let's place our bet. You know what I think\nwe want to bet  Toby? Every single dollar \nincluding that 50 cents. I think we want\nto bet $3 274.50. How does that sound to you? I like it. Lock it in. Dump one ocean\nin another ocean. Australia lies at the intersection\nof three different oceans: the Pacific  the Indian \nand the Southern. Collect at least six ounces\nof one of those three oceans and  before the day is over \ndump it into a different ocean. If the day ends  or you lose\nthe six ounces of ocean before you can accomplish this \nthen this challenge is failed. That's breakfast\nout of the way. That's breakfast sorted. We're really just— We're taking it easy\nthis morning  because that is actually \nright now  probably strategically\nthe best move for us. So  I mean... we've still got about an hour\nuntil we need to go to the airport. We're gonna go check out\nthe Botanic Garden. Yeah. See if that's any... any... See if it's fun. Welcome to the\nAlice Springs Botanical Garden. So far  I would say\nthere are minimal botanics. I'm seeing some\ninsanely large spider webs  which in the context of Australia... ...makes me scared. What are you doing?\nI'm looking for a water bottle. Can't we just buy one\nat the convenience store? Well  why waste\na new water bottle? Man. Okay  man \nthey're very diligent about cleaning out their trash cans. That was your last bin. Now we need to go to the store.\nYeah  okay. Let's go to the store. I think we're here\nduring the wrong time of year for there to be flowers \nunfortunately. Yeah  well  it's evident that no one is in\nAlice Springs right now. Ugh  oh  a bug went in my eye. I wonder why. Alright  I think\nwe can turn back and go to the airport. I think we've experienced\nthe Botanic Garden. Well  now  now we get to... see how exactly we're going\nto make it to the airport. I believe in us. I believe in us too  but... There are no buses\nto the airport  so... It's really just a question of... ...how do we find a taxi? We have had\nquite a lot of trouble. Let's see if the\nBotanic Garden Visitor Center can get us a taxi. Thank you. It was a $5 water bottle. See  that's why we\nshould have scavenged. Hmm... trying to think\nabout logistics here. I guess I probably need\nto take my socks off. I don't... Oh  I'll try not to film them so that they don't\nend up on weird sites. Alright. There it is  Toby. That's him.\nWater... with the pulp. You gotta guard this\nwith your life. We gotta get that bus\nto the airport. Yeah.\nWe got a flight to catch. Do you think\nAdam might be confused about why we bet\nall our money? What the hell? Thank you so much. It says that they just bet\nall of their money. They just bet\nall of their money? I wonder on what. You remembered\nthe water  right? I think it's in my bag. Do you wanna show\nproof of life? He's here. Great stuff. Good stuff. Alright  let's go through security. (wheezes)\nWhat could they be doing? Is it the... Is it the dump one ocean\nin another? Maybe they're picking up water. Then they'll go to the airport \nfly to Melbourne  dump the water... And Bob's your uncle \nget a bunch more money. Yep. Doesn't matter. That's the only thing\nI can possibly think of. But again  I don't think\ntheir problem's money. I think their problem is\ntime  Ben. I think their problem is time. I agree. And they've already\nwasted too much of it. Hey there \nheaded to the airport? Alright  Toby  do not\nlet them take your water. Oh  you made it harder\nwith the seaweed. Well  honestly  I think\nthe explanation of... I collect the water\nfrom all the oceans... and I'm about to travel\nall the way back to... ...let's say Svalbard...\nNo  you're making it worse. No  that's\na reasonable explanation. People collect ocean water. But they would know\nyou are lying  'cause you're not allowed\nto take water overseas. Yeah  well you can say \nI'm checking my bag after this. Or it's on foot.\nI don't know. Just defend it with your life. Hi  we're checking in\nto Brisbane. Sam and Toby \nwe're coming for your regions. Where are they right now? So it looks like\nthey have just left Adelaide. I don't know where they're going. My guess is Melbourne \nbut I don't know for sure. They're gonna have to go to\na lot more than just Melbourne if they want to win this thing. We're going to Brisbane. We have a plan. All we can do is\nexecute on our plan. It is time to leave the desert and return to wreak vengeance. Sam and Toby  your regions... ...will soon be ours. Thank you. Welcome back to Melbourne. I think we are here\nin Melbourne... with a bunch of money\nready to play defense. As long as we\ncan get to the ocean. Oh  should I check that\nthe water bottle is still there? You know \nthere's always a chance the change in air pressure\ncould have split the plastic and it spilled all in my bag. Yeah...? Okay  good. I don't want to look\nat it too much. I don't want it to get\nscared or something. ...Oh. Okay. They could land and realize\nthey've won for good... if we don't successfully\ncomplete anything. Yeah. Or have a feisty budget. So I imagine it's a little bit\nof a stressful fight for them. Yeah  'cause they don't know\nwhat we're up to. So yeah. And I also feel like they probably woke up\nthis morning thinking they had it because they did have\nmore money than us. Or at least a really good chance. And they still have a chance. I think it's still anyone's game. Yeah. We've just gotta— This time now feels\na little bit like chess. Like we have to just\ndefend our positions. We are willing to lose some if we gain others\nand make sacrifices. And we just have to move\nour pieces behind their pieces. They absolutely have\npaths to victory. Yeah. But I am convinced\nthat we probably have more. If we're smart about it. If we're smart about it.\nYeah. I think it's kinda gonna\nsomewhat come down to... ...who anticipates\nthe others' move... ...more successfully. Yeah. Have a\nwonderful day  guys! Bye! Okay  so there's\nbeen a huge problem. Hold on  hold on  hold on. First of all \nwelcome to Queensland. We're going to go ahead\nand put down our deposit. Cha-ching. Now... We're depositing $1 347  one dollar more than them \nand now we control it. Hooray for us. Okay  but minor crisis. Is it minor? Feels kinda major to me. Potentially major crisis.\nOkay. No  those are arrivals. We need the departure board. It's a Virgin flight. Departure. Not that one. Where is it? These are all Qantas flights. Didn't say cancelled.\nLet's go. We need to get to the area\nwhere there are Virgin flights. Yes. Okay  so... Basically  we had a flight. Yes. Hi. Sorry.\nWhat's up? We had a flight\nthat we needed to take  but now that flight\nis not showing up. So we need to go\nfind someone who can maybe get us on it. This actually is sort of\nthe key to our whole plan. If we don't make this flight \nwe are in big trouble. This is looking promising  Toby. Do you smell that  Sam? Sorta  yeah. You smell that?\nWhat does it smell like? There's wafts of\nSouthern Ocean coming from over there. But... the overwhelming... Yeah  it just overwhelmingly\nsmells like Pacific. I hope there's\nno deadly bacteria in that that you're helping spread. No  it actually all\nblew away in the wind. Look at that  Toby \nover there. On the horizon. Do you see that?\nWhat is it? What is it?\nDo you see it? Oh... what is it? It's 4 911 dollars and 79 cents!\nWoah! That is so much money  Toby! That's amazing. What do you reckon\nwe do with it now? Oh  Ben. This is so not what I hoped for. We need to find\na Virgin Australia gate agent. Hi  I was trying to book\ntwo tickets on the 3:10  but I was having trouble. To purchase tickets  yeah. I just connected\nfrom Alice Springs. Okay. Ben. Why does it always\nhave to be hard? Why can't it just be\neasy sometimes? Two.\nJust two. Yes.\nYes please. When would we arrive if\nwe went via Sydney or Melbourne? Nah  that wouldn't work. Unfortunately \nthat won't work. That won't work. Sure... yeah. Thank you. And you're sure\nthere's no chance of standby or any way to get\non the 3:10? Okay. Okay  no chance.\nThank you. That flight is full. Oh  Ben. Oh  Ben. (whispering sigh)\nOh  Ben. ...one-one \nand we left $2 000 here... ...450 minus 750... That's if they do\nSydney–Canberra. If they do Melbourne–Canberra \nit's worse for us. ...minus $650  minus $650... minus $1150  minus... ...And if they do\nthe Sydney route... Oh wait  sorry.\n...we have 2 502... So I think we're good. Okay  so should we do\nthe Avalon flight then? I guess let's make sure\nwe can get there. Our really  really \nreally awesome plan that was definitely going to work has hit what I would call\na massive roadblock. Do you want to explain what our really  really \nreally awesome plan was? Yeah. Now that we\nseemingly can't do it? Here  I have to do this.\nYou explain it. Okay. What we were gonna do is we were going to fly\nfrom Brisbane to Canberra  claim that  and then... hop on a bus\nright over the border because the Canberra airport's\nonly two miles from the border of\nNew South Wales. We wouldn't have to get\nall the way to Sydney. We would literally just\nhave to get over the border  and then there we could deposit in New South Wales\nand claim that  and that would lead us to victory. Now  we cannot get\nto Canberra on time. So... Seemingly our leading theory is that there is a flight\nto Sydney... that gets in at 6:15 \nand then... if... we beg... we might be able to book... a flight at 7:05 to Canberra. Because we can't book it\nas a connection  because... We can't  no. Because then we wouldn't\nbe able to deposit. We wouldn't be able\nto deposit in Sydney. I'm gonna go ask Virgin how... if we got in at 6:15... If they think we would be\nable to book on a 7:05. Well  they're not gonna know. But  they— I mean  I— They might have the rule. They might know what the rule is.\nYou know what I mean? Clearly  they have a system that\nshuts down at a certain point. Okay  I just— I think\nif we want to get this flight  we need to book—\nIt might go away. Yeah  yeah  book that flight. I think that this is\nour best option. I'm just gonna book this. We're just gonna have\nto try going to Sydney and just pray that\nwe are able to get on this flight to Canberra. I can't believe that  Ben. Yeah. Okay  we booked\nthat flight to Sydney. Alright. Oh  let's... pray that this works. I think we found\nour path to victory. It's a little bit different\nfrom what we thought. We can explain in more detail\nin a moment. We're in a bit of a rush. Alright  flight booked. Now we gotta get... ...not back to the airport. We gotta go to... somewhere\ncompletely different. 2:45  that's us. Ben and Adam have deposited\n$1 347 in Queensland. (chuckles deviously)\nBut counter-intuitively... I think this is great for us. This is great news\nfor us  actually. They're exactly where we want them. This is good. Especially because we did the thing\nwe haven't actually explained yet. (giggles)\nA lot's happening. Here  wait  show your shirt. \"A lot is going on\nat the moment.\" Certainly. And they're\nprobably currently... hurriedly rushing\nthrough Brisbane Airport... ...with some illusion of hope. I don't know\nwhat they're doing  but we'll keep an eye on them. Keep an eye on their tracker.\nYeah. It's very possible\nthey have some genius plan. The one downside of\nthe plan of ours is... we're pretty much done for\nin terms of flexibility. In terms of where we go. Yeah. So if they somehow have\nsome sort of cunning something... Plan up their sleeves? Yeah  we  we...\nwe could be screwed. Pivotal time. Pivotal time.\nSee you guys later. Heyyy! Oh my god. Wow.\nThis is huge. Thank you so much. Yeah.\nOf course. (whispering) Alright  Ben. I think this is gonna work. Mhm. Well  we'll try to beg\nour way onto the 5:55  but that seems like\na lost cause. But if we can make the 7:10  that should be enough. Yeah  that'll be enough. Oh my god.\nOh my gosh. Alright  well...\nNo. Fingers crossed. Thank you.\nThank you. Okay. (titters)\nThere's three seats on it? Of course there's\nthree seats. Alright  I don't\nknow how much of that was clear to the audience. So  we went back\nto the service desk. They were able to change\nour 3:35 to Sydney to the 3:05 to Sydney. That means we'll get\ninto Sydney at 5:35. That's gonna give us\na little extra margin to get on that 7:05\nto Canberra. However... she just said that there are only\nthree seats left on that flight. And of course we can't\nbook it until we get there. So we just have to hope... that fewer than two people\nbook on that flight in the next several hours. Why can't it\never be easy  Ben? Why couldn't we have\njust gotten on the 3:10? We cultivated\nall of our desert power  and then we were supposed to\nget on the 3:10 to Canberra. That's how it was\nsupposed to work. It's 'cause we left the desert. You can watch our\ndesert power meter just draining by the minute.\nYeah  yeah. If you take a look at\nthe desert power meter that we've had up\nthis whole episode  it's a lot lower than it was. It's a lot lower. But you know what?\nIt still might be enough. We're gonna see when\nwe get to Sydney. Jesus.\n(laughs) Oh no. Alright  I'm now 99% sure that they're on\nthis flight to Sydney. Well  that's what we thought. And I think we're feeling... Yeah. You've gotta learn\nyour geography. Why? What's going on? Just for Jet Lag: The Game. No  you don't. As in... You as in general. Yeah  you've gotta learn\nyour geography. They're on a bus towards... ...Werribee? Or Geelong  maybe? I don't think there are\nany challenges down there. I don't even know why they\nwould be doing a challenge. 'Cause they don't need\nany money. Maybe they're just like... They're just vibing out?\n...vibing  hanging out? Seeing the sights? Or they're about to pull some... Or they're about to pull one of the most incredible\ntricks we've ever seen. But I think it's unlikely. I don't know.\nLook  at this point... ...nothing's out of the question. What are they doing? Who knows. Who knows. Yeah  we've been on the bus\nfor an hour and a half. It got rather delayed. We should be alright  but the flight does leave\nin 45 minutes. Yeah  very small airport. So I think it'll be okay  but... ...yeah  a little tight. A little tight. Yeah. The bus was supposed to get\nhere 30 minutes ago  but... It should be okay. This airport is a bit out there. Certainly a little bit\nmore out there than Melbourne Airport. (scanner beeps) Thank you. Okay  here we go. Sydney. Let's hope this works. (exhales harshly) This was not\nthe plan I hoped for. But it's the plan\nwe've got now. (clapping) (groans lengthily) Hello. Thank you. (whispering) Okay.\nWhew. Alright. Let's get outta here. Classic tight... Yeah  they only\njust started boarding  and we're already at the airport \nso that's great. Yeah  this is when\nI normally get to the airport. Oh  there we go. Alright  plane's there. (sighs) I think it's going to be\na stressful flight  Toby. Why? What if they've thought\nof something we haven't? I feel not so stressed. Okay.\nIt's possible. They could be up to\nanything  I guess. I mean  we've thought\nof something they haven't. Therefore—\nOkay  to be fair  we think we've thought of\nsomething that they haven't  but they could be\none step ahead of us  and they know what\nwe think we've thought of  and they've thought of\none thing or more besides. Yes. We'll see. Got it. We definitely didn't\nalmost forget that  right? We were just doing that\nfor dramatic tension. Okay  more bad news. While we were in the air \nthe price went up on that Canberra flight\nout of here  and now it is...\n$13 out of our budget? Uh-huh  it's... $13. So I don't want to\nthink about that too much. Okay  wait  this isn't\nshowing everything  because I'm missing stuff  so... Now there's a question of if we should try and go\nto Melbourne and retake Victoria instead. Because here's the thing. They put down a deposit\nof $1 501. But if they're still there and they see that we're\ncoming to Victoria  they could put down more  and that would put it\nout of budget for us. And we would get there  and we wouldn't be able\nto take it back. But if they have left \nhaving only put $1 501 down... then... They might be on— (gasps) I think they left. Do you think they're on that flight\nI think they're going to Devonport?\nto Devonport. I think they're on a flight\nto Devonport  Ben. That means that we need\nto go to Melbourne. That means we can go\nto Melbourne. That means we can go\nto Melbourne. If we can get a flight\nto Melbourne. Thank you very much.\nThank you very much. Oh. Ohhh (bleep)! Alright  there's\na lot happening. The first thing\nwe're going to do is go ahead and deposit $1 151...\nWham! into New South Wales. New South Wales is ours! Okay. (raspy) Sorry. Where's the help desk?\nThere  there  this way. Let's see if they can get us\nto Melbourne. They're unavailable? Okay... it's fine. Just go to the gate. The flight to Melbourne.\nThere's a bunch of them. That's to Perth. We need a departure board. Okay. Departure to Melbourne. The 6:30. 45? Gate 45. 45. Hi there. I'm sorry  we're... Is it possible to get\ntwo tickets onto this flight? Yeah  to Melbourne. Upstairs? Okay. No  we want to purchase one. Which— Where—\nOkay  those stairs? Okay. Is it— No  this\ndoesn't look right. Well  I don't—\nThey said upstairs. Here? Okay  this seems like a... not an area where\nwe're allowed to be. I mean  he said upstairs. I know  but... This doesn't seem right.\nThis seems like an employee space. No  it's not that.\nNo  this is wrong. Here  let's go back down. Where's the service desk? The service desk? The upstairs service desk? The gate agent told us\nto go upstairs. I think we clearly went\nthe wrong upstairs. I'm trying to book a ticket. Yeah. To Melbourne on the 6:30. It's too late to do it online. So we're going to try to\ntalk to... an agent. Over here. Okay  thank you. Thank you.\nThank you. The guy told us to go\nup to the service desk and we went upstairs and\nwe immediately realized we had very much gone\nto the wrong place. I'm sure that\nwould be lovely too. That's fine.\nYeah  yeah  yeah. Can we— Can you look\nat the departures from where they're going? Because I feel like they have\nto be going somewhere else next. Devonport. Oh  great. Yes  that'd be fantastic. That would be perfect \nthat'd be perfect. Fantastic.\nThank you so much. Thank you so  so much. Tickets on the flight. We are going to Melbourne. Not where we expected to go. Not where we intended\nto go  but you know. I think it's\ngoing to be enough. Unless they have some\nway to turn around and get back to\nMelbourne or Sydney. I think this might have\njust secured us the victory. That might be it. No more surprises  please. Thank you  Ben Doyle. Thank you. I think that might be it. (whispering grittily)\nLet's go! Let's go  baby. Adam  where is our\ndesert power meter at? I think the desert power meter is\nextremely high at the moment. Through the roof. Oh my god  I think\nshe put us in economy plus. That's crazy. Whew. (wheezes) Mm-kah. Didn't even break a sweat. We're on the flight\nto Melbourne  Ben. And they put us in\neconomy plus. And they're in\nDevonport  Tasmania. And I think they're\nstaying there  buddy boy. Two whole days?\nWait  three days. Alright. Welcome to Gold Coast. Ben. Look at where they are. They're on the Gold Coast. They're on the border between Queensland and\nNew South Wales  Ben. They did not go to Tasmania. No  they did not. Uh-oh. We can reclaim this region by depositing two dollars. What do you reckon?\nShould we do that  Toby? Two dollarydoos.\nSend them right now. Is it worth it? I think it's worth it. Okay  I think it's worth it. We like this place.\nIt's nice and warm here. It is nice and warm here. I reckon that's worth it. Let's do that. Let's take Queensland. Alright. Two dollars deposited. We're gonna catch a bus. And then we have... (giggles in anticipation)\n...I think one more step. And the airport\nis on the border. That could have been\ngood to know. We did not know that. We're here. Toby? Do you know what this\nrepresents  Toby? Oh yeah. (laughs) Do you know what\nthis line represents? Shall we? Shall we? Three  two  one. That's New South Wales. That's our fourth region. We haven't claimed it\nyet  though. We haven't claimed it yet. I'm gonna ask Ben and Adam to give us a call\nonce they land  and we can each make\nour last moves  let's say. How about that? Great news  Ben. We landed in time. At least we'll make\nour deposit. Guess let's go ahead\nand do that. Pshoo! Whee!\nYaaay. Sam and Toby said that... ...they want us to call them. Wonder what that could be about. I think they're gonna concede. Hello. Hi  Sam and Toby. Yeah  so we  you know \nwe deposited $2 in Victoria  which puts us at 4\nand you at 3. And I think that's\nthe end of the game  right? We wrap it up.\nThat seems like that. That would be it  right? Wait  I'm gonna... Did we just lose? Do we have anything left? I'm trying to think. I do actually have\nsomething to show you. Yeah  I thought you might. We've got these—\nYeah. An interesting fact\nthat I'm just now learning. Yeah  we've got these\nnice big triangles here. And you might wonder what\nthese triangles symbolize. I can see the letters.\nI figured it out  yeah. Well  there's\nthis thing that says... That stands for Queensland.\nExplains what they're symbolizing. And... this is confusing. You might  at first  think\nit stands for \"Nice  Soby wins\". Right.\nWell  that would make no sense. I understand why\nyou might think that. But we came to realize that it actually stands for\nNew South Wales. Oh. Uh-oh.\nUh-huh. Yeah. And... therefore... I think  Toby \nyou're on the right— you're— I've gotta be over here. Yeah  you've gotta be over here.\nWe've gotta both be together. The two mates\ncan't be separated. You guys are\nreally drawing this out. Is there a deposit\nyou want to make? Or we want to make? I'd like to make two dollars. Two dollars.\nOn New South Wales. Yeah  I concur. Yeah. Yeah  I thought\nyou might do that. Yeah  that'll do it. That'll do it. Now  I think there's\nactually a motion graphic for this exact moment. Ohh! It's a nice motion graphic. Wow! The motion graphic. Wow. It's got kangaroos jumping over these tall towers. No  no  no \nthat's too complicated. That's too complicated. Snakes slithering\nup the streets. No  that's too complicated.\nAnd a spider too. That is way too complicated. Alright  well. Sam  Toby... We've said this once before  and it seems we'll say it again. Congratulations\non winning this season of Jet Lag: The Game. We have been trying\nto pack light this season. So I don't have a full\nmetal trophy for you  but I do have this. Whoa! What's that?\nIt's a balloon. Yeah! But  and I'm gonna... Whoa!\nIt's getting so long. It's curling all around \nbut now I'm gonna take it... (gestures vocally) Whoa! Look at that. It's the first ever inflatable... balloon animal\nJet Lag: The Game trophy. That's awesome! And now I'm gonna let it\nfly up into the air. Whooaa!\nThere it goes. There it is. There it is. Oh my goodness. Wait  wait.\nA giant balloon animal. Toby  catch it  catch it. It looks like a kangaroo.\nCatch it  catch it. Catch it  catch it.\nYou got it? I've got it. I've got its feet.\nOkay  don't let it go. It might blow away. I've got its feet. I just have one\nfinal question for you. And it goes to Toby. You know  it's been\na long four days. And I guess\nI just want to know... ...how are you feeling? Toby has been crossing\nthis line... constantly. Constantly.\nConstantly. And  you know  over there... what time is it over there? 7:30? Yeah...? 8:30. Oh my god. 7:30 again. Your sleep schedule\nmust just be— Yeah  I feel like I\nwould take a toll on you. 8:30. Yeah  your sleep schedule\nmust be just so out of whack. And this is my\nfourth state of the day. So  so how do you feel? Well... (yawns) Mate  I'm feeling... ...jet lagged! Wooaaah!\nYea-ha-ha-ha! (hoots)\nShe said the thing! She said the thing!\nOh my god! Woo-ho-hoo! Alright  that's it for season 10! We're gonna see you next time! See you next time in\nseason 11! Woo!\nWoo! That's a lot of seasons! Whew! Woo! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Thank you so much for watching\nthis entire season of Jet Lag. We really appreciate you making it\nall the way to the end. And believe it or not \nthe next thing that we have to tease for you is...\nnot Jet Lag. It's called The Getaway \nand here it is. Welcome to The Getaway where these six creators\nare taking a road trip to transport a $10 000 prize across the great American West. The problem... (on phone)\n...there's a Snitch among them! Sabotaging the group\nat every turn. The Gamer? Am I 1 000% sure\nI am not the Snitch? Absolutely. The Zoologist? Is there nothing I can say\nto change your mind? The Therapist? You guys trust-trust each other? Actually trust each other? The Card Counter? I'm not— I'm not\nthrowing shade at you. (giggles)\nBut the way that I think it would be smart to do it—\nSteven! The Finance Guy? This Snitch thing is\nvery stressful. I go to bed at night \nand I worry. The Political Scientist? I have this suspicion\nthat... we did get the Snitch. You really never know. Sure.\nOkay. This is a tense moment. Okay  here we go. What am I? Alright  nice. (scoffs) Ohh yeah. (giggles)\n(chuckles) Snitch.\n(chuckles) So here's\nwhat's actually going on. We really like shows that have \nyou know  a sabotage element. But there's already so many that have a saboteur. Okay.\nAlright. I have this special role. I'm really carrying\nthis entire series. There's even the ones\nthat have a couple of saboteurs. Boston I don't believe in.\nJersey I don't bel.... (cracks up  growls)\n(others clamor) It's Boston.\nBoston was never the city. But as far as we know \nthere's none that have... ...everyone as the saboteur. And we thought\nthat would be funny. In some way  I'm like \nare there two Snitches here? (overlapping shouting) We got— We gotta run! Oh my (bleep) god! (shrieks) There's no script for this.\nSo  you know... That's a great— Oh  that's gonna make\nthe trailer  dude. Yeah.\nYeah. You mother— That looks so good! It looks so good!\nOh my god! We made a really good show. We shouldn't actually\nset expectations that high. No  but we worked\nreally hard on it. We really need you\nto go watch it. Yeah  it's—it's—it's— It's one of the more interesting\nthings of all time  I think. That's a huge\nstatement to make. No  I think that's reasonable. I think that's reasonable.\nYeah  yeah. And to be clear \nthe premise here  it's quite interesting. We basically wanted to make\nkind of a saboteur show  the idea being it's like\none of these shows where you vote people off\nbecause there's a saboteur. You have to find the saboteur. Except we've told every\nsingle one of the contestants that they're the Snitch \nthey're the saboteur. They're  you know  the traitor \nwhatever you wanna call it. So they all are playing\nas if they're the only one. They all think they're\nindividually the main character. Yeah  it was really stressful It was pretty funny.\nto keep that secret. But where can they watch it? Uh  Nebula. Yeah  this \nwe do wanna be clear. This will not go up on YouTube. This is a Nebula Original because they paid us a lot\nof money to make a big thing. So if you wanna see what happens\nwhen six people all think that they're the main character\nin a show simultaneously....

        "transcript": "Hello! This is where I'm hiding. Good luck finding me here! We're playing hide-and-seek\nacross Switzerland over the next four days. We're starting in Lucerne\nas the Seekers... ...while I got a\ntwo and a half hour lead to get to my hiding spot here. Yeah  I think this is\ngonna take them a while. Welcome to our four-day game of hide-and-seek\nacross Switzerland. The goal is simple: Hide for as long as we can\nwithout being found. Based on a random draw  Ben and I are starting\nas the Seekers. We're in Lucerne \nand Adam  the Hider is... well  we don't know.\nIn order to figure it out  we'll have to buy information\nfrom him about his location  choosing from the 76 questions\non our giant question menu. Adam has to answer\ntruthfully  but in exchange  he'll get coins that he can use to buy curses\nthat will slow us down. Once we find Adam \npositions will rotate  and it'll be someone else's\nturn to hide. After four days \nwhichever player has had the single longest hiding run wins. We'll get more into the\nother rules once they're relevant. Right now  Adam's clock is ticking. So Ben and I need to figure out\nwhat information we should buy  so we can start heading\nin Adam's direction. Okay  so right now \nAdam could be pretty much anywhere\nin the country. Yeah  he got a two\nand a half hour head start. Do you have any guesses  Sam? Because it would be great if we didn't have to\nask any questions. Well  I mean there is logic\nto going to higher elevations  so that this is snow. Okay  so  they're\nprobably gonna start buying information\noff of me soon. So I'm gonna go ahead\ninto town  because... some of the questions\ninvolve having to do stuff. And I think most of it's\ngonna be easier if I'm there. So  let's go. Okay. Okay  so we're there. Adam is... we don't know. Probably like... (laughs) He could be\nanywhere within here. Yeah. Now there are a lot of\nquestions we can ask. There are different categories. Okay  let's talk\nabout the categories. There are five types of\ninformation we can buy. Relative information\ncompares some element of the Hider's position\nto the Seekers': whether their elevation is\nhigher or lower than ours  whether they're in the\nsame canton  and so on. The radar allows Seekers to find out whether or not the Hider is\nwithin a certain distance from us: 50 miles  10 miles \n500 feet  et cetera. Photo requests force the Hider to send a picture of something\nin their hiding zone  like the tallest visible mountain  a local church \nor the train station. Oddballs force the Hider\nto complete some task that might give away\nsome information. For example \nFaceTime the Seekers until you can show them a bird  send them 30 seconds of audio\nfrom your local train station  things like that.\nAnd finally  once the Seekers find\nthe town where the Hider is  they'll use precision questions to pinpoint their exact location. Here's the thing. I think that we need\na direction to go. I think we want\nto ask longitude to figure out whether\nhe's east or west of us. 'Cause we're basically smack dab\nin the middle of the country  so that'll split it into two. Okay.\nYeah. So we're gonna buy\nthat piece of information  and then we'll see what he says. Okay. So they have just bought\nmy relative longitude. I don't love that. I would've much rather they\nasked my relative latitude  'cause that's much less useful. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Probably. (sigh) I'll text them. Okay  Adam has said that he... His longitude is higher. Which means he is east of us. Okay  that's really\ngood to know  because... the eastern part of the country \nit's more nothing. Yeah  I mean \nexcept for Zürich. There's the whole Zürich city. Look  I got a gut feeling \nif I know Adam  you know  we're like those twins\nthat have the secret language  that we can talk with the minds.\nSure  sure. I feel like he's\nin the mountains. I feel like he went\nto the mountains. Oh  there's a\nsnowplow coming up here. Hello. Hello  friend. Well  okay. If he is in the mountains \nthen what do we do? 'Cause the mountains\nwould be south of us  whereas the populated bit\nwould be north of us. I mean  is there any way\nfor us to head straight east? Not really  I don't think. Maybe it's worth\nasking another question whether he's south or north. Yeah  we're just\nkilling time though. We are killing time. I mean  every minute matters. But the problem is—\nI know. I think— If we go the wrong way... Yo  you're right.\nI think yeah  maybe north-south makes sense. I mean  when can we ask that? Five minutes. Whoa  look.\nIt's a little stone guy. Hello  little stone guy. This place rocks. Alright  we're just\ngonna go to the train station. It's just right over here. Alright  I think it's time. We don't really know whether\nwe want to go towards Zürich  or we want to go down\ninto the mountains. So we're gonna ask if he's north or south of us. Alright  I'm firing it off. Go for it. Alright  so they've\nasked for my relative latitude  so that's another 40 coins.\nThat's good. So that does tell them\nthat I'm in the southeast  which is a\nrelatively sparse area. I don't necessarily love that\nthey know that this early. I mean  I'll let them know. Oooh. What'd he say?\nSouth. I told you. He's in the mountains. So here's the issue. If Adam's in the southeast  it means he took either this\nsmall isolated line to Engelberg or this busier route to\nthe greater southeast. We don't know which he took  but if we wanna move now \nwhich we really should  we'll have to gamble and pick one. So I think we just\ngotta gamble  I think. If we want to move  which\nI think it makes sense  we gotta gamble. I think it would be\ncrazy for us to commit to one town \ntwo questions in. It would be  but\nof course he knows that. I know he knows that! I think it does make more sense to take the higher frequency thing because it'll be\nhigh frequency enough that we can bail and come back. Yeah  okay  let's do that. Okay. That means Adam's not there. Does that make sense? There's some\nlittle elf guys on there. This place is full of little guys. Here's a little guy there.\nHello. Okay  so this is almost\ncertainly gonna jinx me  but... I think the key to this hiding spot is I really don't\nwant them to know how much snow is here for as long as possible. The worst questions for that  the one I'm really\nscared of  which... I'm for sure gonna jinx myself  is they make me\nsend them a picture of five buildings\nin the same frame. 'Cause I don't think the\nbuildings here are dense enough... that I'd be able to take a picture without any snow in it. I think we should\nask a photo question. Yeah  a photo question\nmight be helpful. Okay  yeah. Let's buy a photo from him. What kind of photo do you\nwanna buy from him  Sam? (marker rubbing) I mean  the five buildings one. Maybe? I feel like that one's\nthe most likely to give us some sort of incidental\ninformation. Right. I'm gonna go ahead\nand tell you right now... incredibly slippery here. One of the slipperiest\nplaces I've ever experienced. We're gonna just\nfor sure not die walking on the street  please. I'm gonna go inside\nthis little restaurant. So I think five buildings one.\nI think you're right. Most incidental information likely. (sigh) Okay.\nIf we do that one. Let's go ahead and buy\nthat photo from him. We'll analyze it\nwhile we're on our way. Well  this sucks. Okay  we got 20 minutes\nto do the best we can. Okay  okay  okay. Okay.\nSo the key to this is... Is there a way that\nI can frame five buildings that doesn't reveal that\nthere is a ton of snow here? The answer is  I don't know. (bleep bleep bleep) Alright  so this is\nthree buildings. Yeah  that's nothing. I could shoot down this way  but you can totally\nsee all the snow. Oh  this sucks.\nThis sucks. This sucks. This is the exact one\nI didn't want. One  two  three \nfour  five. I think if I zoom just right... I can... yeah. That's pretty good. Okay  done.\nSend  sending. Sent. Oh  there we go. We got the photo. That is quite the tight framing. I mean  those buildings\ndo look mountainous. But the other thing I'm noticing\nis they look very new. They look very clean.\nThey look very new. They also look dry. What? Yes. Yeah. Okay... I actually feel pretty good\nabout how that went. I kinda didn't think I was\ngonna be able to do it  but... I mean  that's five\nbuildings cleanly in there. No snow  so... That actually is a huge relief. Yeah  so my conclusions\nare mountainous town... and potentially  given how\nnew these buildings look  a touristy town. Yeah  somewhere\npretty wealthy. We're looking at\ntwo sort of similar... nearby towns\nthat both seem like sort of Swiss resort towns. One is called Engelberg  and one is called Andermatt. And we don't wanna\nget too far from here if he is in Engelberg \n'cause we would've to go all the way back around\nto get to him. So  I actually think that\nthe tool to use right now... would be a 25-mile radar  because if he was in Engelberg  that would hit him. But if he was in Andermatt\nor anywhere other than here in this little region \nit wouldn't hit him. Mmh. I guess it's worth it. I think it's worth it to know whether we\nshould continue or not. Yeah  no  it's pretty valuable  'cause that could mean hours of difference. I think that we\nneed to just make sure. Okay  should I send it? Yeah. Alright. Let's go explore\na little bit more. And let's also scope out some potential\nfinal hiding spots. 25 mile. Okay  well they have hit me\nwith a 25-mile radar. Ha-ha! I am gonna let them know. Alright  we got a response. Ooh.\nOkay. Our radar is a miss. It means that\nhe's not in Engelberg. It means that we didn't\nmake the wrong decision getting on this train. I don't think... Need to pull out our\nvery scientific map again. It doesn't seem like\nhe could have really gotten into this canton here. So that means that\nhe's probably either in this one or this one. We're gonna be in this one  which is called Uri  right? Yes. We're gonna be\nin that one soon. So we could check and\nsee if he's in that one. Yeah  yeah. Might be worth it. Just worried about\nspending all these coins. 80... 110... I have 125 coins. So that's enough\nfor two curse dice. Wait  curse dice? Alright  alright. Let's finally talk about\nwhat these coins are for. In order to slow us down  Adam can use his coins\nto buy curses. Many curses force the Seekers\nto complete challenges before continuing to\nmove or ask questions. Others place harsh\nlimitations on their movement or what questions they can ask. And the very best curses\ncan even allow the Hider to completely change\ntheir hiding location. But Adam doesn't just get to pick which curse he wants to buy. When you buy a curse  you roll dice to see\nwhich one you get. The higher the number \nthe better the curse. For a better shot at\na high-tier curse  you can pay more to\nroll more dice  at 50 coins apiece. So 100 coins to roll two dice  150 coins to roll\nthree dice  and so on. Now  back to Adam. And I kinda think I should... use them? Let's get to some shelter. You think the church is open? (whispers) Whoa. So I kinda think\nwhat I want to do is wait until they're on a train. And then roll the dice. Okay  they're on the train. Let's do it. Let's do it. Okay  let's do it. So I'm gonna buy two dice... and roll both of them. I'll add that number\ntogether... and hope that it's\na high number. (dice rolls on bench) (dice rolls on ground) (dice rolls on ground) Seven. William Tell Curse. Before you ask your next question  you must knock an apple\noff your partner's head from a distance of 15 feet. If you fail  you must wait\nfive minutes before trying again. (chitters) Ahh  this rocks. Look at the mountains. Look how pointy that is. That's very pointy. I feel like the mountains\nwe have in the US are not that pointy. No  the Alps are\ndefinitely pointier  which is a big feature. Sam  we've gotten\nhit with a bit of a curse. William Tell. Good news  he used\ntwo dice to get that. Yeah. And that's a pretty\nbad one to have got. That's literally the lowest—\nWell  actually no  that's not. But it's a pretty low one\nto have gotten for two dice. That doesn't\nworry me that much. No. Considering\nthe William Tell curse  and also considering\nhow much of the canton we've excluded based on\nthe 25-mile radius... Check it out  this is  we use science\nto determine that. Considering all of that... it kind of makes sense for us to seemingly go all the way\ndown to Göschenen because that's where\nwe would transfer to a lot of stuff that we\nwould want to get to anyway  and we can get the\napple curse cleared  and then ask more\nquestions based on that. (mouth click) They're continuing\nto get closer. I don't love that. So... I think let's keep looking\nfor potential hiding spots. It's snowy. (chime)\n(door opening) It's theoretically possible\nthat he could be here. He could be here. So we should  you know \nwatch out for the architecture. Here's the thing. There are a bunch of these\nlittle mountain towns in this sort of stretch. And  my guess... is that he's in one of them. Yes.\nIn this area. Because if he went further down  all the way down to Lugano  that's— it looks like... Italy  you know? It's really...\nMediterranean looking. Oof.\nOh my god. Now we have to\nfind an apple  and... It's a little moist. It's a little moist \nand this is not a huge town. You sure we don't\nwanna take that train? 'Cause it could take\nus to Andermatt  which is a bigger place. Okay. I think it makes sense. It leaves right now. So that we don't have to wait. Game time decision. We've taken the train. Okay. Yeah  this\nweather definitely... tosses another variable into this. At least we're not\nAdam having to potentially hide out\nfor hours in it. The little guys\njust keep coming! Hello! Now where should I hide? I guess I could go up there just 'cause it's far away \nand that would be annoying. What about in that thing? Are you allowed to go\nin that thing? Let's go check that out. Pretty sure we're\non a cog railway. Yeah.\n'Cause you'll notice that... It's pretty steep. Yeah  we are rather leaned. Oh my god. Look at this. Oh my god. Look at that. Come on. Crazy. I mean  this has gotta be\none of my favorite places that we've done Jet Lag  and we've only just started. Don't slip and die. We're gonna go ahead\nand not slip and die. This is going to be\nkey to our strategy ...is not slipping and dying. This is a fundamental\ncomponent of the game. Okay  there's fences up there. It seems like\nyou can get up there. Ohh. Interesting  interesting. Oh. Welcome to Andermatt. Ben  it's still raining. Okay  well... Adam could not have gotten\na lot further than here if he is in a mountain town\nin this region. So... Feeling good. It is possible that he is here. But first  before we buy\nany more information  we gotta get rid of this curse.\nSo let's go get an apple. Hopefully this\nisn't hubris  but... I feel like we're on\nthe right track. Don't  just don't say anything. Apple. Hallelujah. Okay. That's a bad apple. Oh man  it's like... This is one of the\nworst apples I've ever seen. Get a good apple. I tell you what\nI like about this spot. Hard to figure out\nhow to get up here. And tiring to get up here. Two good things. Don't die. Do not slip and die. Eins  zwei... I don't know. I don't know German. You don't know\nyour German numbers? I wanna say 'trei'? Sounds right.\nYeah? I believe you. Thank you. Okay  what should I\nthrow at you? Something softer\nthan the other apple. Snowball. Let me get a sock. No  not a snowball. Rock. Okay  maybe a rock. Okay.\nYou ready? Good luck  Sam. Oh  I'm not\nfeeling good about this. Okay. Hit the apple.\nGotta manifest. Hit the apple. Oh no! Alright  it's 11:12. We got five minutes. Try again  five minutes. It says to\nenter your own risk. Means I am allowed to enter. (dripping inside) Well... Not really covered. But I guess this little spot is. Neat. What are they up to? Well  the bad news is they\nare getting closer to me. Quite close. Let's look to see\nif we can find the building that Adam sent. It's small. If he is here \nthere's a decent chance we'll see the buildings\nthat he took pictures of. Yes. Oh  I was more talking\nabout the apple  but yes. This is... a wee bit slushy. It feels like\nthis is small enough that we can check out\npretty much everything. Yeah  that's true. You see that building  that building is kind\nof a similar style too. Not it  but... similar. Yeah  again \nit makes me think that he's in  if not here  a town very... nearby.\nRight. That serves the same purpose. There's no way that\nI'll get to stay here. They're gonna ask me to do\n(bleep) some stupid (bleep)  and I'm gonna have to go\nall the way back down there. It's gonna suck. I'm just gonna get ahead of it. Let's... Let's assume this is\ngonna be the hiding spot. Let's go back into town\nso that we're ready to respond to  you know \nquestions and stuff  but I feel good about this place. Okay  so here's something\nkind of interesting. And I don't know\nif they know this  but... the next train from where\nthey are to where I am leaves in just under\n20 minutes. So  if they don't get on it  they're gonna have to\nwait a whole 'nother hour to get on a train here. Which means... they need to do\nthis apple thing and figure out\nbasically where I am ...in the next 18 minutes. Okay. Oh no!\nThat was closer though. Oh  that was so close! Come on! Noooo-nngh! Auunngh! Alright  incredible\nTeam Adam news. They did not get on\nthe train here  which means even if they do\nfigure out that I'm here... they're not gonna be able to\nget here for another hour. So I have a guaranteed\nadditional hour. I'm gonna go back to\nmy little cafe. Are they really... still doing it?\nThey can't be. 'Cause— I guess if\nyou were throwing a bigger object at me... Should I throw\nmy backpack? No. What if I threw\nmy entire jacket? Right  I feel like that would\nbe more likely to hit it. Oh  it brushed it! (grimaces) Yeah! Okay  well...\nOkay  okay. What do we want to ask? That's a great question.\nThis apple is getting mushy. Do you want a bite?\nI do not. I think we need to figure out\nif he's in this little region. Yeah 'cause\nI think you're right. 'Cause we'll have to\nchange strategy dramatically if he's not in the\nnear surroundings. He could have either\ncontinued down towards Italy. He could also be all the way\non the other side. Yeah  which would be...\nWhich would be real bad. Yes. But I think we\nhave to just check. What we know is\nthat if he came here  he could basically\nonly have gotten within 10 miles of here within his two and a\nhalf hour head start. I think let's do a\n10-mile radius. It's pretty risky... but if it hits  then we're \nI mean  we know we're close. Alright. (heavy sigh) Oh. Has he responded?\nWe got an answer. What'd he say? He's within 10 miles of here. Oh  baby! Okay. We didn't majorly\n(bleep) up at all! That's interesting.\nOkay  okay  okay. If he is within 10 miles of here  he's either in here or\none of maybe two other towns. But like... we couldn't find those buildings. Oh my god. Oh  the slush is slushin'. Yes  it's very slush. So if he is this way \nhe's there. That doesn't look\nbig enough to me. No  that's nothing. If he's this way... I mean  he could be\nin \"Hospen-ental\"  but that looks pretty small. I mean  we could try and ask a precision question\nthat is unique to here. The hotel one\ncould be interesting  'cause there are definitely\nvery expensive hotels here. We would get an answer\non whether he's... Those hotels are\nmarkedly cheaper... Much cheaper.\n...than these. So we would know. And all of these\nare in the $200s. Yeah  I'd say\nlet's send that. It's cheap  and... It'll give us a good sense\nof where he might be. Okay  I'm sending it now. I need to move.\nThey asked the hotel question. And there are a few hotels here. I need to get next to... the cheap hotel. Okay  let's go. Alright. This hotel \nnightly price  $100. Ah  damn it. Ah  damn it. That was a pretty good question. So basically what happened is\nin the town where they are  there are no hotels\nthat would round to any of the same numbers\nas the hotels here. There are hotels in\nanother nearby town. One of which would round to the same numbers\nthat would round here. So... But I wasn't closest to that one \nso I had to run next to it. So now they don't know\nwhich one I'm in  but I think they now can\nnarrow it down to two ...unfortunately. Well  it can't... Is it even a CBD drink? I don't know \n'cause there's no chance that you can just spell—sell THC spiked iced tea\nin a vending machine. I think it might\nliterally just be weed flavor  which is rough. Okay.\nWe got an answer? Yes. $100. Oh. It's interesting. Let's look at them now. Okay  well  they\nare at the train station. Which I don't love. Don't love that. Don't love that. There are basically\nonly two hotels that we can find in the entire\n10-mile radius that we got. Yeah.\nThat he could be next to. There's one in Hospental \nand there's one in Airolo. The thing is  it takes\n30 minutes to go there. And we'd have to transfer. It only takes 15 minutes\nto go to this place. I think it would make sense\nto go to this place  check it  and then\nif he's not there... Yeah  I think I agree. It'd be pretty risky\nto go to Airolo and then have to backtrack. That would be almost\n45 minutes. Yeah. You know \nassuming the timing. Okay  we're gonna\nget on the train  and we're gonna go\ncheck Hospental. Alright  this is just\na four-minute ride. This could be it. Or we could be currently\ngoing away from where he is. Welcome to Hospental. What?\nWhat? What is this angle\nthat you're filming at? This is a crazy angle. Welcome to Hospental. We're committed now. The next train's\nnot for 30 minutes. If he is in this town  and we've just entered it  that means that he has\nhad to pick out his hiding place  which means if we ask him... (train whistle)\nOh  that's cute. ...a photo or an oddball question \nhe won't be able to answer it. And that will tell us\nthat he is here. And he will tell us\nthat he cannot answer it. Okay  I think I'm into it. Requesting photo\nof train station. Okay  so if he\ncan take the photo... he will take the photo  which\nmeans that he is not here. And if he tells us in the endgame \nthen we are in the endgame. Yep. Ugh  god. (sigh) (bleep) Well... Oh  we got an answer. (gasp) He can't! He's here  he's here.\nOkay  okay. We're in the endgame  Ben. Calm down. I can't believe that we\ndirectly went to the right town. That is unbelievable. So  okay. The one thing\nthat we do know... is his hiding spot is\nalmost certainly covered. 'Cause he would be\nhypothermic if he is not covered\nin his hiding spot. Yeah  Adam\ngets cold really quickly. (sighs) That bridge could\nbe a hiding spot. That's not a bad— Should check it out? Team... What's our team name? Sem? No  ew  that sounds weird. Does not look like here. No  I think we have to ask some of the precision questions\nto really figure out where— Okay  well let's be\n100% sure with our math. We can ask three. Should we ask\nupward photo maybe? Yeah  upward photo... 'Cause he's\ngotta be under something. That's true. So I think upward photo would tell us what to\nlook for  that he's under. Yeah  let's ask\nfor the upward photo. Okay  good. This is\nwhat I was hoping for. They requested the photo  the precision photo\nfacing upwards. That's why I went up here  because I think you'll\nonly be able to see the sky if I place it in the right spot. (chuckles) That's useless. Should we push into\nthe town a little more? I mean  look  I think\nthat there's a good chance that we could just see him. Yes.\n'Cause there's nothing here. God damn. Oh  this is where\nhe took the photo. Is it? Maybe. Look at that. I know that looks similar \nbut I don't think it was that. I don't see the other building. Oh  unless— Oh  no.\nWait  Ben  Ben  Ben. Look  this angle. Yeah  that's it. That's it. Okay. Oh  he sent the photo.\nHe sent the photo. Okay  let's take a looksee. Oh  this is exciting. Let's take a looksee. Oh  that's just pure sky. Well... How is— Is he— Okay. Is he giving\nhimself hypothermia? That might  I mean \nI guess that means that he is certainly not\nnear a building. Well  how is it pure sky? Now  the problem is\nthere's another type of photo they can request. And that one I think\nmight screw me  but... We'll see. Should we ask front-facing? I mean  that\nwould definitely help. I think it makes sense. I mean  can you think of\nanything that would be more helpful? Not really. Oh. There's a little castle up there. That would be the kinda\nspot that he would go. He likes castles  Sam. I think also this way\ncould make sense. Do we wanna get\nfront-facing photo? I mean  I think so  right? I think that's probably\nthe most useful. I was really hoping\nthey wouldn't request that. Yeah  that's... That's gonna give it away. Alright  he sent us... You ready? Oh  that's the castle  I think. He is...\nThat's a (bleep) castle. He is fully exposed. He is... Is he on top of the castle? Okay  I think it's time\nto break the glass... and roll the curse dice\nas an emergency. I just  I need a six. Anything other than a six\nis basically useless. Well...\n(dice clatters deeper) I dropped the curse dice. Yeah  they're probably\nnot even gonna do that. Swiss clock. Before you ask\nyour next question  you must clap 15 seconds after your\nother team member starts a timer  within 0.5 seconds \non each side of 15 seconds. If you fail  you must wait at least\n10 minutes before re-attempting. Okay  so he asked\nthe Swiss— He sent us the\nSwiss clock curse. But it's a question one. I don't think we need\nany more questions. No.\nSo let's just skip that for now. Okay  I feel like\nmaybe this way. Put it in a map. Well  it's not\nreally showing the map. Yeah  it doesn't really show\na good walking route. I think we need to\nsuss it out visually. (whispering) I think\nthat they're looking for how to get here \nwhich is hard. It took me a while\nto figure it out. I don't know\nhow we get to that. Yeah  I think it's\nback through town. Okay. Oh god. Ooh boy.\nCareful. Should we check\nthis out  you think? Sam  is this right? Huh? Oh  the snow is so deep. (bleep) I mean... He's wearing boots \nand I see boot footprints. Yeah. Is he in the castle? I don't know. Thought I heard something. This might be the end of the run. Well  he's not here \nbut there is an inside. Oh god. Adam! Are you up there? Yeah  I (bleep) see you. This sucks. This totally sucks. Well done  Mr. Chase. Oh  this sucks. Alright.\nYou picked quite a spot. Well... You guys got really\nclose to me really fast. And it really scared me. And then you hung out\ntwo miles away from me for about two hours \nand that was awesome. Well  on the other hand  we took the\nmost direct route here. Yeah  I know.\nThat sucks for me. Yeah.\nI saw that you did that  and I was really annoyed\nabout it. Yeah  I mean \nmix of  honestly  I think we put some\ngood skill into that. Yeah.\nWe asked the right questions. There you go. Alright  two hours and\n30 minutes starts now. Ohh! I have some bad news for you. There are two trains currently\ngoing through the station  neither of which I think\nyou're gonna make. They're never gonna find me. Let's get his ass. Actually  I gotta\npick up the pace. Fun fact  this is the bridge\nwhere Ben and I knocked apples. Where could he be?! It's all in the trees. But this might be\nthe end of my round. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus All that and more\nthis season on Jet Lag. And of course  as you\nmight know by now  you can watch\nevery single episode – including episode two –\none week early on Nebula. That means you can watch\nepisode two right now on Nebula! And Nebula's got all\nkinds of other great stuff  including original content from\na lot of your favorite creators. There's Modern Conflicts \na great series from RealLifeLore that explores modern warfare. There's a new episode of\nthat out actually right now. Taboo on Screen from\nBroey Deschanel  which explores how\nfilmmaking approaches taboo subjects like\nsex and murder and even more taboo things\nthat I won't even mention here. The history of the B-2\nby Mustard. Also  we have done\nsome original stuff. In addition to\nvarious documentaries and stuff that we've made  we released a whole\nepisode of outtakes from the last season\nof Jet Lag. That video of outtakes\nis actually longer than the first episode\nof that season. Plus  the whole first\npilot season of Jet Lag is exclusive on Nebula:\nCrime Spree. So there's a lot of stuff there. And those are\njust some of the ways that we focus on giving the\nbest viewing experience possible to our Nebula subscribers. We also have the Layover podcast. We release that every single week\nwhen we're in season  diving deeper into each episode.\nYou know  talking about the game design  the strategy \nthe behind-the-scenes moments. We argue about why\nwe were actually really smart when we did the thing\nthat kind of might be perceived as\ndumb and stuff like that. We also did an episode right\nbefore this season started  doing a super deep dive into the game design\nof hide-and-seek. And before that \nwe played a game that was similar but not legally\nthe same as Family Feud on it. It was a lot of fun. But that podcast is great  and it's available exclusively\nto our Nebula subscribers. Anyway  tldr; the best\nJet Lag viewing experience is on Nebula. And it's not that much of\na commitment to sign up  especially if you go\nto nebula.tv/jetlag. Because you get 40% off  which brings the cost down\nunder $3 a month. I think it's basically\n$2.50 a month at an annual cost like that \nwhich  you know  is— And that's less than\na third of a latte if you're at a really\nexpensive latte shop. It's less than a third of a— And most people buy\na third of a latte every day. Yeah. So if you stop buying\nyour third of a latte every day  then you can buy—\nYeah. Assuming it's a really\nexpensive latte shop. Right.\nBut  you know  anyway  go to nebula.tv/jetlag\nto sign up  and thanks in advance\nfor your support. Bye! Wait  where's Ben? Well  that is\nthe question  isn't it? No  where... Oh  he's still in Switzerland."

        "transcript": "Welcome to episode two of our four-day game of\nhide-and-seek across Switzerland. In this game  the Seekers must\ndetermine the Hider's location by buying information from them. In exchange for truthful answers  the Hider receives coins\nthat they can use to buy curses that will\nslow the Seekers down. At the end of four days  the player with the longest\nsingle hiding run wins. Last episode \nAdam was found in a castle in the mountain town\nof Hospental after hiding for just over\nfour and a half hours. Now  it's up to Ben to see\nif he can beat that time. He's got two and a half hours to get to a hiding spot\nbefore his clock starts and the Seekers start\ncoming after him. There you go. Alright  two hours and\nthirty minutes starts now. Oh!\nGood bye. Hello  and welcome\nto my hiding zone. Which will remain a mystery. Until they figure it out.\nOr you figure it out. You'll probably figure\nit out before them. You guys are smart. I did not have as much time\ngetting out of Hospental. I was starting from\na pretty remote spot. There also wasn't\na train for a while  so I really only had\nabout an hour  forty-five of actual train time. And that cut down\nmy options a lot. Also  I had to get down\nfrom that freakin' castle. We are s-s-so back. We're back! I really did not want to have to climb up this thing\nagain  but we did do it. Oh  it's time  it's time. Okay so  Ben could have gone... Yes.\nEast  west  north  or south. The main directions  yeah. So seemingly  there's... one line west.\nYeah. There's one line south  but then it gets\ncomplicated at the end. Yeah.\nThere's a line east that does some complication\nat the end of that. Or  what I think would\nbe the smartest move would be to go north.\nYeah. Back towards Lucerne  because then you have\na lot more optionality. There's certainly\nthe most optionality  is by him having\ngone north or south. We all keep talking\nabout Ben's limited options  so just to clarify: because Ben had to start his\ntwo and a half hour hiding period from Adam's very out of\nthe way hiding place  he was pretty restricted\nin how far he could get. Adam and I don't necessarily\nknow the limits precisely  but we can be pretty confident he's somewhere within\nthis rough blob. That's bad news for Ben  and things are about\nto get even worse  because we have\na pretty sinister idea for our first question. We were discussing\nduring our break  and we had an idea. There is an oddball\nquestion  which is: Send us five words. One of them has to\nrhyme with your town. If you ask that at the beginning... then they have to\ncover all their bases. So Ben will have to send us stuff from the north  the east \nthe south  the west. Because he's gonna send stuff that rhymes with plausible\ntowns  most likely. Yeah  but then\nonce we narrow it down  there will probably be only one  two  maybe three towns that rhyme with whatever it is. So I think it makes sense\nto start with that. Let's hit him with that\nLet's hit him with that and let's talk about\nthe rest of the questions while we start\nwalking to the station. Alright  let's go.\nLet's go. Okay. We have got our first purchase. It's an interesting one. It makes me feel like they're\nprobably pretty confident. (grunts) (sneezes) Ugh. Oh  we got an answer. Rug. Rug  so that rhymes\nwith Zug  which we know. Yeah  that's interesting. Awaken. Boxcar  Again  and Clam. It's interesting that... Zug[zoog] or Zug[zuhg] or whatever\nthat town is called. Yeah. That is a prime candidate. I do agree  Zug[zuwg] is\na highly attractive... It's almost just too obvious. Yeah  that's the only thing. Makes me think\nit's the red herring  because it's like... It's pretty much exactly as\nfar as he could get that way. Right. Although  Sam  I think we need\nto ask a relative question ASAP if we want to be able\nto ask another one before we get to that decision. Yeah  what one\nwould we want to ask? I think that we\nshould do political party. Yeah. I mean  it's pretty\nuseful geography  I agree. Yeah  we can\nexplain why in a minute  but I think we need to ask it now. Okay  do you\nwant to go for that? Yeah  I think so. Okay  can you\ntext it or should I? I'm texting right now. Alright. Just real quick  this question\nasked Ben if his canton – cantons are like\nregions of Switzerland – voted for the same party as\nour canton in the last election. Given the voting map and the blob\ngeography we're dealing with  this should roughly cut\nBen's options in half. A yes would mean he's\nsomewhere in here  and a no would mean\nhe's somewhere in here. Okay  they have asked\nanother question. They have asked\nif my canton voted for the same political party\nas their canton. That is gonna  I think  sort of slice down\nthe possible map in two. Smart question. It's fine. Ooh. His canton voted for\na different party. So that pushes towards— So that excludes all of the west. This is east or south\nthen  I think. Wait  so it couldn't be north? Let me confirm. Would Zug be a different party? Zug is different. Is Zug different?\nYeah  it's green. Whoa  okay. Here  once we get to the station  let's do some more research. Yeah. Okay  so we have... 13 minutes.\nOkay. So we need to\ndecide  basically  what we do when we get\nto Andermatt. Yeah. Let's look into it. I mean  for what it's worth  on the line going east  I don't see stuff\nthat cleanly rhymes. It doesn't  okay. What's 'boxcar' trying to do? We should look at\nthe weird ones. What's he trying to\ndo with 'boxcar'? What's 'clam' also? 'Cause here's what I'm saying.\nSomething has to end in— Cham. Cham rhymes with 'clam'. Which makes me think\neven more he might be in Zug. Look... Merzingen  'again'. Mhm. Cham  'clam'. Zug  'rug'. If there's a 'boxcar'... Baar  'boxcar'. Mhm.\nHe's gotta be up there. I mean  it would be\na real big brain move to give us four things that weirdly rhyme with\nstuff in that area. I mean  I guess you could do it to really try to throw us off \nand maybe it'll work. I just realized\nI still have this apple. I gotta get rid of this. Well  I think it\ncertainly makes sense to – prevailing theory –\nhead towards there  right? Yeah. Oh (bleep) \nwe need to get outside. Oh. Oh  will it not stop\nif we're not outside? No. Oh  (bleep). (train approaches rapidly) Is it not gonna stop at all? We'll see. For real? Okay... Adam and Sam still seem\nto be in Hospental. Which... means to the\nbest of my knowledge  they... cannot get on a train... until 4:41  in half an hour. More than a half an hour. Which means that they won't\neven leave Hospental until... an hour into my run  which... I mean  is a good start! Okay  so to\nexplain what happened... what we just learned is that\nto make the train stop here  you have to press the little button. And if you don't press the button  the train does not stop. So now we have to wait  what  a half hour for the next train? Yes. Awesome. Anyway.\nIt's okay. It's ultimately not a huge deal. It's just annoying. Yes  and our fault. And for sure our fault. That's how the jets lag. That is how the jets lag. Okay  it's fine  it's fine. I think he's gotta be there. It's a little bit of a risk  though. It is a bit of a risk.\nIf he's (bleep)-ing with us. It certainly is a bit of a risk. Well  let's see.\nCould we ask other stuff? Aren't all of these\n(bleep) towns on the water? Pretty much  I think. Couldn't we ask\nfor a picture of a lake? I guess that's— wait. Photo questions are\nrelatively cheap  right? They're what  20  15?\n15  yeah. I guess  yeah  it could be useful. And we can ask it now  yeah? Yeah  yeah. Whew  well... Adam and Sam\nhave requested a photo of my biggest body of water. Which is a pretty obvious one. It's this lake here. We're gonna use our best\nphotography skills to... be vague about this. Let's see here. I've taken a photo of the lake. I do think that I've\ndone a pretty good job of including\nno defining features. It is probably pretty clear\nthat it's a lake. Although maybe\nit's not even that clear. It's kind of hard to tell. The photo just looks like water. Oh  we got a photo. Well  that looks like a lake. It looks like a lake to me. 'Cause it has to be 100+ feet. So that's definitely not a river. No  that's not a river. So it seems to confirm north. I mean  everything\nis pointing north. He's in the Zug area\nfor sure. I mean  I think we've\nnarrowed it down to... frankly  a pretty tight area. If we're right.\nIf we're right. I think we're right. Probably. Here's one thing I gotta do. I gotta get a place\nto sleep here. Because here's a little hint\nthat I'm gonna give you guys. There is only one hotel\nin this town. Okay  I found the hotel. It's kind of unbearably cute. (softly)\nLook how Christmassy it is. Okay well  Adam and Sam\nare still in Hospental. How does it feel  Adam? In the end having spent\nthe entire game day except for one hour\nin this tiny town? Look  I love... I forgot what it's called. He's stopping! Oh  Ben. I mean  here's the thing. Ben was put in a very\nunfortunate position by having to start here.\nThat's true. And that is part of\nthe strat  you know? I mean  look  it was not-not\npart of why I went here. But also  I will remind you that last time\nwe were overconfident about Ben having potentially made himself too easy...\nIt's true  the last time we were overconfident... He  spoiler alert... He absolutely got us.\nHe won the game. We did get\nabsolutely got by Ben. Yes. They're never gonna find me. Fun fact  this is the bridge\nwhere Ben and I knocked apples. Alright. Well  this is\nas far as we can get. Yeah. There's nothing\nmore we can do. There is nothing\nmore we can do. It's 5:05. The game day ends at 5:30  but we can't get any further. And I don't think we want\nto buy any more information. No  I think we want\nto wait until we're closer to ask any more questions. We don't want to give\nhim the potential to curse us  you know  in a way that could be\nreally disruptive. But I think that's\nprobably it for today. I think that's it. Here  do a funny stand. You gotta do a funny... Oh  do an awesome pose? Yeah  do an awesome pose\nthat you're gonna do in the morning. Is that awesome?\nUh-huh. Alright  now wave good night. And if you say good night. Good night! Good night. Okay  well  it seems\nthat Sam and Adam have ended the day in Göschenen. And I have ended the day\nhere  in my hotel room. I've set up my strategy... and now we just have\nto see if it works. We'll just see what happens. Now it's time for\nthe first rest period. Each day at 5:30 pm  the game pauses so that\nplayers can eat and sleep and not be in the\nfreezing cold for a bit. We'll restart the\nnext day at 7:30 am  exactly where we left off. Good morning! We are so frickin' back. We're back  baby! Our train towards Zug\ndoesn't leave for  what  25-30 minutes?\n25 minutes or so. Not the best.\nNot the best. Anyway  let's do some strategy. So... We think we're\ngoing to the right place. Look  here's the thing. Either Ben did an absolutely\nnuts  big brain move... Which he has in the past. And he's done it in the past. Or... we know basically\nthe region where he is. And probably have it\nnarrowed down to two towns. What I would say is  assuming that we do\nknow where he is... he both was unlucky that he was in a place\nwith unique names that don't rhyme with a lot. And I would also argue that\nhe made a tactical error by giving specific— words that only\nspecifically rhymed with weird places\nthat were right there. Yes  I mean \nthe one variable is  what if he did that specifically\nto send us to that place that kind of seems pretty\nobvious as a place for him to go  based on the timing\nwhere he left from? But we don't think so. (slower)\nWe don't think so. We don't think so. W e  d o n ' t  t h i n k  s o . Okay. This is a very\ninteresting first one. They've asked for five words. One of which has to rhyme\nwith the name of my town. Here's the thing \nI kind of want to... send them up towards Zug. So I'm gonna try that. Oh  we got an answer. Rug.\nRug. So that rhymes with Zug[zuhg] \nwhich we know. Yeah  that's interesting. I do agree Zug[zuug] is\na highly attractive... That would be a pretty big... big brain gamer move. But the lake!\nBut what about the lake? (slower)\nWhat about the lake? What about the lake? W h a t  a b o u t  t h e  l a k e ? Adam and Sam have requested a photo of my\nbiggest body of water. I'm trying to send them to towns that are on a different lake\nthan the lake that I'm on. So I just need to make this lake\nfeel fairly nondescript. Oh  we got a photo. Well  that looks like a lake. It looks like a lake to me. It seems to confirm north. I mean  everything\nis pointing north. He's in the Zug area  for sure. That's a good point.\nI admit  that's a good point. We'll see. Alright  let's get on the train. Good morning. I'm back here in my hotel room. And we have just gotta\nkeep hiding. And hopefully... they go to the wrong lake\nthis morning. That's... If they go to the\nwrong lake  then... then I'll be happy\nwith my strategy. If they go to the wrong lake  then I will have done at least\none smart thing on this run. And that's kind of my standard... for this game.\nAs long I can do at least one smart thing\nevery run... I'll be happy. So  let's see if\nI can keep that up. Sam  look \nit's getting less snowy. We are out of the slush zone. We're out of the slush zone and headed to the Zug zone.\nThis is so exciting. I think we gotta start\npoking around this morning to see if we can find\nour final hiding spot. So yeah  let's just go\non a little adventure and find ourselves a spot. Look at all those mountains. I do see the mountains  yes. It's a great point. Alright  so do we\ndefinitely want to do... photo of train station? Do we want to look\nat the options? Yeah  how about\nlet's take a quick look. Okay  so now that\nAdam and I are headed to the area\nwe believe Ben is  we're hoping to find a cheap\nway to confirm his location. After some discussion  we decided to ask for a\nphoto of his local town hall  figuring that once we get to Zug  we'll be able to see if it\nmatches the town hall there. So  should we go ahead\nand do that? Yeah  let's request\na picture of the town hall. Whew  I'm getting\nfurther up into the hills. I've made it pretty\nfar out up here. And honestly  I think\nif I hid this far up  it's just going to be\ntoo obvious that I'm up on top of this hill. I think I need to be more... in the town. 'Cause there's just gonna be\nmore actual hiding spots. So I don't think that\nI want to go this high. The Seekers have requested a photo of my town hall  but... as far as I can tell \nlooking at the maps and doing some googling  I actually don't think that\nthere is a town hall here. Hello. Does this town have a town hall? Great. Thank you so much. Okay. He said that there\nis not a town hall... Within his radius.\nWithin his zone. Which either means he has\na rather unintuitive zone... Which is possible  but he— We know that the water\nis in his zone. Maybe he set it specifically\nto exclude town hall. Tsk. It's possible. Just a quick note about zones. The Hider cannot go\nmore than half a mile from the spot they were when\ntheir official time started. The area they have to stay in\nis called the Hiding Zone. The rules say there has to be a\ntrain station in the Hiding Zone. But otherwise  depending on\nwhere the Hider centered it  the zone's limits might make certain photo requests\nimpossible to fulfill. I'm a little worried that\nwith that last question... knowing that there's not\na town hall in my zone... It might make it pretty obvious which town I'm in. Because I'm definitely\nin the smallest town that is among\nthe remaining towns. Or  he could be\nin a really small place that really doesn't seem\nto have a town hall. I guess  but it'd\nhave to be very small  I think  to not have\na town hall. I kind of think that maybe\nhe's in lower Zug. Maybe.\nI'm just saying  if he got off here... he could have transferred and\ngotten to Oberwil-bei-Zug. Yeah.\nWhich is lower Zug. And that... would probably not\nhave a Zug town hall. Oh yeah.\nIt's separate. Is it still around Zug? Yeah  it's still around Zug \nand it would still be a town hall. Yeah. But he could also be at\nZug-Fridbach  Zug-Casino. There are multiple stops\nin lower Zug. Mhm. And would it still\ncount as Zug the city? Yeah  this is all Zug. I think we do the train station. Check out Zug. And... maybe check out other ones \nor maybe ask him more. You know  honestly  just... this playground here is\nnot a crazy hiding space. This is pretty far up and\npretty far out of the way too. I know  but I'm gonna\nkeep looking. Okay  now they've requested\na train station pic. I think if I'm... clever about the way\nthat I take this picture... There are certain parameters... for how we take the picture. But I think if\nI'm clever about it... I can hopefully not\ngive away too much. Well  the train station is... hardly a station  but... I'll do my best. Oh  this is interesting. The back of the train station\nlooks very different ...than the front of\nthe train station. That... could be useful. Because then \nif they go past this  they might take one look\nat this train station and be like  \"Oh  it's not\nmade out of this orange wood.\" Okay  let's try that. Yeah. I think that could be\npretty sneaky. Okay  so we\njust got this picture. We are going to pass through several stations south of Zug  but we just won't stop at them. But we can hopefully \nwe look really closely. If we notice that red color \nthat reddish orange. We're about to\npass through one. Okay  which side? Here  I'll look at this side.\nYou look at that side  okay? (hisses softly) Didn't seem like it. I mean  it was kind\nof just hard to tell. Yeah. Although it didn't\nfeel like any of those. It didn't really feel like it. It would have that. Which makes me think that... Maybe we should\ngo west first? At least if we\ndon't have other info. (sighs) Yeah. Well here  let's— We're at Zug station now. So let's check here out\njust quickly and then go from there. Well  I just took\na look at the tracker  and I am afraid... That's the wrong way \nSam and Adam! Have fun in Zug! But that is not where I am. Ouch! Alright  let's investigate\nhere quickly first. Okay  this is not looking good.\nIt's definitely not this. After walking\naround the station  it became clear Zug\ndidn't match the photo. So Adam and I started looking at more rural stations\njust west of Zug. There were two contenders that\nwouldn't include the town hall: Zug Chollermüli and\nCham Alpenblick. So we quickly hopped on\na train to give them a look. Okay  go. No. Next one? No. It doesn't have any\nsort of siding on it. Alright  so\ngetting off here  right? Yeah. Yeah  'cause any further— 'Cause one stop further\nis Cham  which would have a town hall\nas far as I can tell. And it's the theoretical\nlimit for this run. And any further than that... Yeah.\nYeah. Eh. It's a different style of siding  but it's got the right vibes. Okay  so it's\ndefinitely not that way. Well  it seems like it's\nfor sure not this side. Can you check the next train? There's a train now. We can get on that  can't we? We might. Well  we're not going to be able\nto fully check it out  but... Okay  I think we need to\ndecide on another question. (sighs) Okay. So  I've been\nlooking around town  trying to find\na good hiding spot. I'm really feeling like\nthis walking trail might be my best bet. I'm liking this.\nThis is my leading theory. I'm really liking this spot here. Ohh  okay. Status report. I am so hungry. But the only food that\nthis town has is fondue. And I think if I eat\nany more fondue  something really bad is\ngoing to happen to me. Although  the hungrier I get  the more that I hope\nthat they catch me. Because then I can go\neat something. So  you know \nchop-chop  guys. Come on. I think we just need\nto decide on another question. We could ask for\na picture of something. For example  a church. But there's gonna be so many. Right. We could ask for a picture... Feels like we probably— ...where at least five buildings\nare visible to get a vibe. But that's kind of just a vibe. Maybe an oddball. I mean  maybe we just\nhit him with a... We ask him for... the Strava on the streets thing  and just see if that\ngets us anything. 'Cause if he's in one of these\nreally weird little places... Yeah. I don't hate that. How much does that cost?\nOnly ten. Yeah  it could be...\nnot be bad  yeah. Let's do that. I think that might work. I mean  it could\ncertainly help narrow it down. Given that I think\nhe must be in a small area  I think we could match\nwhatever the pattern is to places that don't\nhave a lot of roads. Right  yeah  hopefully. Okay  I'm into it. Okay  they have requested\nfor me to trace the streets. Making at least six turns. I'm not really gonna run \nbecause again  I'm full of cheese. But... I'll get it done for them. Well  at least\nthat was efficient. Yeah. Hopefully it was\nconclusive  but... I mean  it felt conclusive. Felt relatively conclusive. So... I think let's head south now? I guess we might as well \nwhile we wait for the answer. Yeah  I mean  yeah  while we wait for him\nto do that Strava thing  I think we might as well\nhead south. I mean  look  it's also\ntechnically possible we're not in\nthe right area at all. True. This does seem like a\npretty smart question to ask  given that... this town has pretty\ndistinctly shaped streets. If they're looking at this town  they should be able to figure out\nthat these are the streets. Which is a little spooky. Oh  he just sent us\nthe Strava thing. Okay  that's interesting. This does not seem to\nmatch any of the Zugs as far as I can tell. Wait  does it match\nthis southern Zug? No. Okay  so I'm really starting to kind of question our\nassumptions here. Because... I think there's a lot more\nplaces he can be than we thought. I think that we got\ntoo focused on the Zug area. And now I'm starting\nto think that maybe he could be somewhere\nquite different. For example  if he got\noff at Arth-Goldau... He could have gone\neast  for example  to Steinen \nwhich does have a lake. Yeah  I mean  he could\ndefinitely have made it to Steinen In time.\nRight  and that would be an interesting and\nunexpected move. Let me see if\nthat matches Steinen. This looks  this is\ngiving me Steinen vibes. And it certainly has—\nIt has the right— The whole town has\nthe right... Curviness. See  this main road... I don't know  it feels Steinen-y. Yeah  I mean \nI think it's gonna be impossible to 100% match \nbut I agree that the style of roads... looks like that. Well  wouldn't Steinen\nhave a town hall? Actually  look. Look how far that is\noutside of the city. That's more— That's definitely\nmore than a half mile. Oh  wow. I'm already getting\nreal close to... to beating Adam's time here. And  you know  I still... I don't think that barely\nbeating Adam's time is gonna give me\na winning run for the whole game  but... It'll put me in the lead  at least. We'll just have to see. Really  it's gonna be\na question of how long it takes them\nto figure out that they need to \nget out of Zug. 'Cause Zug and those\nsurrounding towns? That's not where they\nwant to be. There are gravel sections outside that station. Uh-huh. I mean  this is probably\na lot of confirmation bias  but... So  it seems like\nthey have figured out that I'm not in the Zug area. And they are heading\nback towards me. So  I think it's time for us\nto go get in position. 'Cause  I mean  if they're\nheading straight for me  they're gonna be here\nwithin the hour. Ugh. We've discovered\nsomething bad. Yes  the shadow is... Yeah.\n...not a lake. Yeah  so\nwe discovered that in Steinen... This  we really thought\nthis was a lake  but it actually—\nWell  big 'we' there. Well  I thought it was a lake  and it turns out\nit was a shadow. You looked at it  and you\nthought it was a lake  too. No  I didn't.\nDid you not? No  I just trusted you. What about... okay. Steinen has a lake down here  but I don't think it\nwould be within his zone. Well  it might be. Unless he had\npurposefully gone south. Which I don't know why he\nwould have to set his radius. Maybe to include less of\nthe town or something  but it seems like a stretch. (sighs heavily) This for sure has\nthe vibes of a place that would have a train station\nthat looks like that. There's the lake. Okay. I don't know. If he walked\neven just a little bit... he could be within\nthe area of the lake. I'm just saying. I have just been informed\nthat that walking path is very much\nprivate property  so... I've gotta very quickly find\nanother hiding spot. Oh god. This is not  this is not... Oh  this is not good. This is not good. Ohh. (bleep) If he's not—\nIf this is not it  I couldn't tell you\nwhere to go next. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Are you gonna be\nin Steinen  Ben?

        "transcript": "Hello  and\nwelcome to episode three of our four day game of\nhide-and-seek across Switzerland. Right now  Adam and I\nare looking for Ben based on a few key\npieces of information: He's hiding somewhere in this blob  in a canton that did not vote\nfor the Centre Party  that is near a lake  that rhymes\nwith one of these five words  and has a train station\nthat looks like this. After wasting quite\na bit of time last episode looking for Ben in the Zug area  thanks to him sending\ntricky rhyming words  Adam and I believe we might\nhave finally tracked him down in the town of Steinen. So  now we're arriving there  hoping to see a train station\nthat matches this photo. Well  already it seems\nslightly more promising. Although very modern. Yeah  now it's\nseeming less promising. No.\nNo. No.\nAlright. Hmm. Oh  man. Where could he be? Okay  I actually think\nthat I might have found the perfect hiding spot. So... If you go through this\ncute little tunnel... you get spat out in this... very secluded public pavilion. It's got a playground\ndown here that you can't see from\nanywhere else in town. It's completely surrounded. I mean  I've been\nwalking around this town for legit hours... and I have not even caught a\nglimpse of this playground. It's like a secret playground. I think this might be the move. It's not looking great. No. Oh  this  yeah  this... This station is so modern. He's not here. There's no way. I mean  last round\nfelt pretty simple  and now I'm realizing just how\ncomplicated this game can be. I keep thinking that\nthey know exactly where I am  and that they're\nabout to come get me. But I am starting to think that they might not know\nwhere I am at all. You're fumbling\nthe bag  boys. You're fumbling the bag. This was supposed to be\na bad run on my part. This was supposed to be\na damn disaster. Look at that little\ntimer graphic. Look at it tick up. That's pretty cool. Hey  that's pretty cool. Is that the high score? Yeah  I think that's\nthe high score. Yeah  I'm thinking that's\nthe high score right now. Ouch. I think we need a question. I think there might be\nsome logic to a radar. I mean  if we did 25  that would encompass\nthis entire region. I just still think he's here. Well  we should confirm. At this point.\nI guess. And I agree  it's like  I don't want to spend\nthat much  but... it's much better to\nspend that much now... than spend the next couple hours looking in the wrong\narea of the country. Yeah  I guess. Alright. Okay  they've just... deployed a 25-mile radar. Which is interesting.\nIt is a hit. They're within 25 miles of me. That makes me think that\nthey're not very confident about where I might be. 'Cause obviously if they have\nfigured out that I am here... then they would just come here. We'll see. Alright  well \nhe's within 25 miles. Oh  interesting. Great. Well... I mean  I kinda feel like\nwe already knew that  but... I guess good to know\nfor sure. Okay. Where the hell is he? \"Rug  Awaken  Boxcar \nAgain  Clam.\" After some more looking  we realized the next\ntown over  Seewen  fit all the parameters. It was within the still-viable zone  rhymed with 'Awaken' \nhad no town hall  and was definitely\nclose enough to the lake. So we decided to go check it out. I mean... It's very pretty. Oh yeah. It's the type\nof place Ben would go. There's gravel on the sides of this. Mm  I don't know. Well  it makes sense\nto get off regardless. Well  let's check it out. Yeah  maybe doesn't look like it. Doesn't seem like it. Could it be... Does not seem like it. Okay  well  I'm definitely\nnot seeing anything that looks like that photo. No  it's definitely not here. (growls) It's probably creepy\nfor me to be on the swing. I shouldn't be on the swing. That's not good. Now that it was clear\nBen couldn't be anywhere on this lake  we went back to the\ndrawing board searching for other candidates. I'm just trying\nto figure out... Let me pull up\nsome of my maps. Vitznau[vist-now] wouldn't rhyme. 'Again' and 'awaken'\nbasically rhyme. So it's weird he put 'em both in. Mhm. He's not at Walchwil.\nHe's not at Hörndli. Chämleten? Is that on the west side? Yeah. What about Flüelen? Despite scouring the map  we couldn't find anywhere\nthat fit all the parameters. So  faced with no other options  we decided we had no choice but to head back up to\nthe stations around Zug to see if there was\nsomething we'd missed. So you think he's... Think he was just\nin Zug all along? I mean  it seems unlikely. But  I just don't see\nother good candidates. Are they... Are they going back to Zug? Oh. Boys. Okay  alright  (bleep) it. I'm gonna go get lunch.\nThis is gonna take a while. (whispers) Oh  Jesus. On our way up to Zug \nwe decided to ask Ben for a picture of the tallest\nmountain he could see. Our logic was that he'd have\nto shoot across the lake  meaning by looking at\nhis angle of the mountain  we could determine\nhis position on the lake. Of course  that assumed\nhe was on our same lake. Okay  well \nthey've just asked me for a picture of\nthe tallest mountain that I can see from where I am. And that's an interesting one. I don't really know\nwhy they asked that. So  these are basically all the mountains\nyou can see from here. And  though that mountain\nis definitely the tallest... what we're supposed to do \nthe point of this question is  what mountain is highest up\non your skyline  basically. So I have to send\na picture of this one. And hopefully that doesn't\ngive away too much. (camera clicks) Okay  let's go ahead and\nsend that picture to them and see what they make of it. Is this our third time here? Yeah  I think so. That's tough. Alright  well  the photo\nof the mountain is useless. Because it's from his perspective  and seemingly there's\na mountain behind him. Alright  well  let's research to see if we can find\nany other candidates. Yeah. Because we might\njust be missing one. Yeah  it's certainly possible. Okay  it's lunch time. I don't know what\nthis is  but... it looked good. (full mouth)\nOh my god. Oh my god. That's so good. What is that? Tell me in the comments. Please tell me what this is. Because it's so good. Oh my god. This is so exciting for me. I love this. Clock is tickin'. I'm starting to think\nhe's not on this lake. (full mouth) Well  there's\nonly two other options. After some more looking  we did find\nsomething we'd missed. You might've noticed this earlier  because you have\nthis neat little map. But we hadn't realized that while almost all of Lake Lucerne\nis in the Lucerne Canton  which we'd ruled out\nbecause of its political party  a very small part of it poked into\nthe still eligible Schwyz Canton  meaning it was possible\nthat was the lake Ben was on. Okay.\nThe road pattern of... Merlischachen kind of fits. But... it's not close enough\nto feel like a slam dunk. Okay  but one second. Küssnacht am Rigi doesn't rhyme. \"Merli-shanen\" does. Okay  wait \nwait  wait  wait  wait. Wait... wait...! I assume you're looking at\nthis thing here. Wait. No  I think this does match. Look... this thing. That totally matches that. Look at the bottom part. Look at these\nnext to each other. What is this place called? Melis  whatever. \"Merlis-chanen.\" I mean  we would need some— To go all the way out there \nwe would need something ...much more conclusive. No  this is the—\nI think this is it. I really think this is it. Wait  wait  I'm gonna trace it. Mm-kay. That's gotta be it. Mmmmnnh... Come on! I mean you can clearly... mm. It's pretty close. That's it!\nOkay  well  let's figure out whether or not there is\nsomething in that town that can confirm it for us\nbefore we go there. And look \nhow about you do that? This just confirmed it for me. I guess I hadn't thought\nabout orientation yet. Orientation fits really well.\nLook at that. It's exact. Yeah  actually  yeah. It's a perfect match. Now that I think\nabout orientation  yeah  that is pretty clear. Okay  seems like we have\nabout ten minutes until the next train option there. What platform  Sam? I think 2? He's... I'm confident that he's there. The road pattern\nmatches way too close. No  I mean  I agree. The road pattern\nfeels like a slam dunk. The road pattern\nis a slam dunk. The road pattern's a slam dunk.\nDoesn't have a town hall. And  wait  do we know\nwhat it rhymes with? Yeah  it rhymes with 'awaken'. Yeah  no  feels good. Merlish— Mer— Merlischachen[mer-le-shaken]. Awaken. Yep. Alright  well  it looks like Sam and Adam have left\nZug once again  and they are heading back south. So  maybe  finally  they\nhave figured out where I am. Or at the very least \nthey have figured out the area that I'm in. Does seem like they're... not wasting any more\ntime up in Zug. Now  I just have to see\nif they do end up taking that rail line\ntowards Lucerne. Because if they do  they'll be heading towards me. (slurps loudly) So  this is the lake ...that we believe\nhe sent a picture of. And  I mean  I gotta tell you  that water looks like\nthe picture he sent. It's the same color.\nIt's the same clarity. It's the same—\nIt does match. No  I think the\nmountain's gonna be... Oh  is that it? I think that might be it. We have to round it more. This is looking good. Yeah  see  now we're\nat more of an angle. Now it fits. It feels... Yeah.\nThat feels definitive. That's the same mountain. Alright  well  Sam and Adam\nare finally on their way. Which means it's time... to go back to my hiding spot. Because if they get\noff their train here  then we enter the endgame \nand I want to be in my secret playground. So  now I just have to\nremember how to get back there. I'm gonna go ahead\nand hide under the... slide  because it's raining. Okay  they're just about\nto pull into my station. Now the question is \nare they gonna get off? Alright  I think really quick before he can curse us \nSam  ask for a photo. Okay. I don't know why he\nhasn't cursed us. Yeah  I'm kinda\nsurprised by that. Hopefully we're in\nthe right spot. Let's see if we can find... something that matches\nthe photo. Is it the back of this thing? No... There it is. Is that it? That's it. Let's get his ass. Ladies and gentlemen... We got him.\nWe got him. Okay  they've\njust requested a... the photo of my face. Which means that I think\nthey know that I am here. I gotta take a nice  good\nphoto of my face. I guess let's head\ninto the town  you know? Yeah. Oh  wait  that feels\npretty useful. (chuckles)\nWhat is that? I don't know \nbut that feels like something that we\nwould be able to find. Yeah  we can\nprobably find that. Almost looks like \nI don't know  like a playground slide \nor I don't know  but... (sighs) I mean... he's gotta be\ncursing us any minute. Why didn't he? No  I mean  I think\nthat that's just a mistake. I've gone ahead and\nsent them that photo. And now that we are\nin the short game  I think that it may\nfinally be time ...to cast a curse. And we can afford ...three dice. So  let's see what we get here. Okay  that's a four \na one  and a three. That is eight. Cheese rolling curse. Before you ask your next question  in a single roll  roll cheese\na distance of 30 feet. The cheese roll curse. Okay  well  you know what? That is probably pretty good  because that's gonna take 'em\na little while to do it. And I think that they're\ngonna have to ask at least another\ncouple of questions before they actually find me. Go ahead and\nroll that cheese  boys. So I'm kind of trying\nto look out for those trees  along with whatever\nthis yellow— It's like an\norangish  semi-rusted... Okay  he cheese roll cursed us \nbut I think we just ignore it. That curse is that\nwe have to do that before asking another question. I think it was a\nhuge mistake for him not to do a curse earlier\nbefore we were in his zone and before we asked\na precision question. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What? I've been here. Wait  you've been here? Yeah. I thought you\nfound where he was. Why have you been here? I came here on my run\nfrom Lucerne  on Sunday. Okay  and here's\nwhat I was noticing. Okay  okay. I noticed— You ran here from Lucerne? Yeah.\nHow far is this from Lucerne? It was 7.5 miles out. I was running by \nand I was thinking  I wish we were filming\nright now  because... What are these? Oh  yeah  I don't know. I cannot for the life of me\nfigure out what these are. And I want the\ncomments section to tell me. Still not the right spot  guys. No secret playgrounds there. Don't dilly-dally. Every minute matters. I have truly no idea. Even a little bit.\nIt's so baffling. They have these little\nspinny things at the top? They're certainly\nnot windmills. No.\nWith the spinny things. I was thinking maybe\nlightning rods or something? Oh  that could be it. Maybe for this construction  but I've never seen that\nanywhere else. I would buy lightning rods. Anyway  comments section \nplease tell me. I'm so confused. Anyway. I remain a\nlittle bit skeptical that we can find him\nwith just that info. Well  I think— Let's do— Let's kind of give\nthe town a once over. Yeah  it's not big. Alright  well  they're\nworking their way towards me. But I think they are no match\nfor the secret playground. You know  you've gotten this far  but your hardest test\nstill awaits you. Can you find\nthe secret playground? I think the thing that\nI'm looking at is there are some pretty\nclear trees behind him that are only in some areas. So we know that he's not here. Yeah. Because we don't have\ntrees like that. And it seems like\nthe two options are... that he's down by the water \nor up a bit. Yeah  I mean \nthat thing that's above him looks pretty distinctive. Yes  once we see it  I think we're gonna be\nable to tell for sure. I think let's head\ndown towards the water. And if it doesn't seem\nlike it's like that  then maybe head up a bit. There's a playground here. 'Cause we thought\nit could be a playground. Okay  it looks like\nthey're by a school. They're probably checking out if I'm at the playground\nby the school. I probably should've picked\na less creepy hiding place than under a child's slide. But it's all about strategy  okay? I'm trying to win here. I'm trying to win\na very important game. We can't worry about\nthe way that this might look to... strangers  okay? I need... to not get found\nby two boys. No. Slide is green. Well  we might be able\nto get a good view from here. Yeah. Unless are we... Are we infiltrating a preschool? This might be a preschool. I think it's a preschool.\nYeah  it's a preschool. It's fine. Oh  there are kids  okay.\nThere are kids  there are kids. Let's...\nNope  nope  nope. I think that\nthey're trying to do this without asking another question so that they don't have\nto get rid of their curse  which is a bold strategy. And I would argue  probably... not gonna work? I think they're gonna have\nto ask another question to find me  but we'll see. I think let's check out\nthe water view. But I feel good about the\nability to identify this tree. 'Cause I'm—\nAll of these trees I'm immediately looking at and\nbeing like  it's not this tree. 'Cause this tree is\nuniquely pointy. I don't know  I mean  look. A circle with a mile in\ndiameter is still pretty big. Do you remember what exactly\nthe parameters of that one is? 30 feet. 30 feet? Yeah.\nThat's a lot. 30 foot roll. Ah  no  I want to\nkeep looking  personally. Well  the grocery store's\nclosed until 2:30 anyway. Uh-oh. I still feel like\nthis will be quicker. Okay. 'Cause... Look  there are only\nso many trees. Again  the tree\nI'm less convinced by. I'm more convinced by that\nwe can find a big orange rod. That too  the combination.\nBut this tree... Look how pointy and\nupwards this tree is in comparison to\nall of these trees. Sure. It's a quite distinctive shape. Okay. You keep your eye out\nfor the trees  and I'm keeping my eye out\nfor the orange thing. Well... I don't have\na keen eye for trees. I think let's head up. Okay. Okay  they are getting closer. They're going up the right street. That worries me a little bit. Uh-ooh. Turn the wrong way.\nTurn the wrong way. Turn the wrong way.\nTurn the wrong way. Turn the wrong way.\nTurn the wrong way. Please turn the wrong way. Don't go towards me.\nOkay  okay. Okay  they went the wrong way. Actually... You like this path?\nThis little path. It's a publicly accessible path  which would make sense\nfor him to be on. Oh wow  this is interesting. It looks like they are\nchecking the hiding place that I was gonna hide in before I found this playground. Okay  so I've been\nlooking around town  trying to find...\na good hiding spot. And as far as I can tell  the best hiding spot would be to lodge myself in that\nbush there  nice and good. Just really get up in there. Are you going to\nfind me in that bush? I don't think so. There's a slide. Yeah  but it's not that. I know  I'm just... pointing it out. You know  honestly  just... This playground here is\nnot a crazy hiding space. This is pretty far up and\npretty far out of the way too. I think if I hid here  it would take them a\ndecent while to find me. But I'm gonna keep looking. Let me Google\nparks and playgrounds. Yeah. Nothing comes up\nfor playground. I assume probably not\nthis one either  right? Nothing comes up for park. Yeah  it's too small  I think. Yeah  okay. So what's down this way? Well  I think we\nwant to go this way. Okay. We have just passed\nhour seven  and they are still wandering\naimlessly in the hills. One thing to also point out is that you can see the\nplayground from Google Maps. So  if they really scour\nGoogle Maps  the satellite  they should be able to\nfigure out where I am. The one thing\nthat I keep thinking is there are all these little\ncut-throughs and paths and stuff. Uh-huh. And that would make a lot\nof sense as somewhere to hide. Uh-huh. Actually  you know\nwhat we haven't done? What? We haven't just\nlooked at the satellite map for a big yellow thing. That's true. You can look—\nYou can see that slide. But  okay  this is interesting. The Google Maps satellite shows a different slide here. It's actually outdated.\nSo if they use that  they might think that\nthis isn't the playground. Ooh. Ooh. That's an area\nwe haven't looked at. Although I don't see trees. No  but the trees\ncould be behind him. I bet it could be those trees. Yeah  it's kind of far though. How far is it? Well  it's not too far. It's the area we want to\ncheck out anyway. Let's head that way. Yeah. It doesn't look like\nthere's anything that would match. No. But you'll notice... You start to see the trees\nmanicured in the right way. It's all in the trees  you see? The trees  what? The trees. No  I know.\nIt's all in the trees. Now that we're getting\nmostly by trees  and with the grocery store\nstill closed – preventing us from\nclearing our curse – we continue to wander\nwith less and less luck. In retrospect  I really\nshould have picked a spot that I was willing\nto actually stay in for more than five minutes. Because the ground is so cold. And I look so stupid. And if anyone shows up here... I mean  frankly  I don't know\nwhat the laws are here  but I feel like... if you see a fully-grown man\njust sitting under a slide  you should be able to kill him. So... Hopefully that doesn't happen. At a certain point \nwe should ask a local. Yeah.\nWe should be like  \"Do you know what this is?\" Okay  they are getting closer. I mean  Sam is... directly in front of that building. But I don't think that he can see\nthe playground from there. I don't think that there's a way— In ten minutes \nwe can get our cheese and ask another question. So  I think let's poke this way\nand then get the cheese. Yeah. No  it seems like\nthey have passed me. Okay. Oh  that was a close call. They were this close. They were literally... They were just in front of\nthese two buildings here. If those buildings weren't there \nthey would've caught me. Well  we have\nnow taken long enough that the grocery store is back\nopen from its lunch break. So we can probably\nclear our curse and ask some\nadditional questions. Which seemingly\nwe're gonna need to. Yeah  I mean— How have we not found him?! This place is not big! Alright  Sam. Cheese. I mean  this is a wheel. Yeah. That makes sense.\nWant that? Yeah. Let's do that. Alright  how do you feel\nabout your cheese rolling ability? I feel pretty good about mine \nfor what it's worth. Here  this is pretty good. This would work. Yeah. Let's go with this. I feel extremely confident.\nDo you want to do it? I'll do it.\nYou got to do the apple. I feel extremely confident. Okay. Here we go. Well  that was easy. Wait  get the cheese! Get the cheese! (giggles) No! No! I think now we just\nflood him with stuff. Which one would\nwe want to do next? Let's get the letter that\nhis nearest street starts with. Is that going to be useful? Most of the streets\nstart with 'S' or 'R'. But I do think it would be useful. I mean  if you think so. Yeah  I mean \nit would exclude a lot. So  it seems like they have\nfinally gotten rid of their curse. 'Cause they just asked me\nfor my street letter. We'll see what they do\nwith that information. It's an S  okay. There's a lot of Ss.\nWell  there are a lot of Ss. Okay  do we want\nto fire another one? Maybe  well  let's look. Okay  well  there's two key— There's— Stutzerstrasse?[stoot-strah-tz] Which we did look a good bit. And then there's...\nthis whole thing here. Which  we didn't— Seeplatzweg? Okay. Maybe let's just\ngo check that out  since we're so close.\nSo wait  Seeplatzweg? Yeah  we're so close. Okay  let's go\ncheck out Seeplatzweg. Doesn't seem like this fits \nbut I just want to be 100% sure. Sure is pretty. I mean  I don't see\nhow he could be here. So let's check out\nthat other one. I think we checked here. Did we check this path? Yeah  but that would\nbe a different road. Because this is a different road. So that wouldn't hit here. Okay  it seems like they're\ngoing down the right street. But are they gonna see\nthe entrance to the playground? Because you can't see the\nplayground from the street. I don't know. Maybe they'll try it? We'll see. This might— This might be about to be\nthe end of my round. I think it's either this \nor there's another one here. Yeah  well  there's also little poke-outs over there. So let's circle back up\nand come down these. (anguished)\nI think we looked here. I'm pretty sure. No  we already checked here. We already checked\nboth of those. And this is the end\nof Stutzerstrasse. They went right past it. I mean  they went\nright past the entrance. Oh my god. I don't  I mean  I don't know\nhow they're gonna find me. They're just gonna have\nto go back and notice it. Wanna sit down on\nthe bench for a second and figure out what next? Yeah. We're sure there's not just\na very little Ben under there? Right? He's not the tallest\nguy in the world. We sat down to thoroughly\nscour Google Maps  but after 15 minutes of looking \ncame up empty. So  we decided to buy\nsome more information. We could ask how many\nminutes would it take for you to walk to your\nnearest train station? That's interesting.\nLet's ask that. The answer is\nonly eight minutes. So now they know that\nI'm not up in the hills. You'd think that this\nwould have helped us more. But it turns out  not so much. So we sat down on\nanother bench and asked another question. I just don't understand. I agree. I totally agree. Do you want to photo up \njust to see if that gives us anything? Maybe there will be a building. I guess. But  I mean  we have a\npretty good upward angle. But I guess. The picture\ngave us some info on what Ben's\nnearby buildings look like  which got us close. (wheezes)\nHe's not in a magical place. It's just a place. We should be able to find him.\nHe's in Gringotts. But  we once again\nmissed the entrance by a few hundred feet. Maybe he just... like we said  found a really\nunintuitive path somewhere. Yeah  he must've.\nBen must be getting bored. (slow ticking clock) So  for a third time \nwe sat down on a bench to try to figure out\nwhat we could be missing. Maybe... (sighs) Well have we looked  Sam... Have we looked here? I can't tell what that is. That's... there. I'm not sure. I think we have \nbut maybe not? Maybe. Maybe we should\ngo check it out? Yeah. That's eight minutes. Look. That path says it's\neight minutes. Okay.\nI think it might be that path. You want to check it out? Yeah  yeah  ugh. We must just... This way? I think we might've missed it. It's down this street. It's down and then it's\nover there  I think. That has to be it. Well  I feel like we've\nsaid that a lot of times. Here  we can\ncut down this way. Actually  look \ncut down the other way. You know what's gonna\nbe awesome is the... motion graphic map\nthat shows us walking within 100 feet of it\nsix times. You're getting awfully confident. So it's this one here? No  it's to the right. It's around this bend \nand then it's a left. Oh  I see.\nThere's the hedge. There's a hedge. This. We haven't been\ndown this. I don't think\nwe've been down this. Oh  (bleep) I think I might fit.\nSmoke stacks. I think it might fit. There's the damn slide. Oh my god. That (bleep)-ing guy. Hi.\nThis sucked! (growls crazily) Alright  Ben  give me the dice. Yes. Right now. Yes. I need more. You need more? I need more.\nThat's ambitious. This sucked. Yes. This sucked so much. It sucked for me too. I was sitting under\nthat slide for so long. Ben  what's the fastest way\nto the train station? I think you... Through one of the—\nDown and around. Alright  see you guys.\nGood luck  Sam. We— I mean \noh my god  dude. Hated this! Yeah  well \nthat's the score to beat. Congratulations.\nThank you. I have a little surprise for you. Goodness.\nLook what I got. Glühwürmchen! I had really good\nfondue last night. This is awesome.\nLet's go right now. There's also\none restaurant in town  and it serves really good fondue. Let's go there  and\nthen let's go to the hotel. Okay. We got fondue. We're talking about the plan. Okay  so we've been\ntalking about tomorrow. The situation is\nwe really need to find Sam. If we don't find Sam tomorrow  then we both lose  because... That'll mean that his run\nis longer than my run. And that Adam\nwon't get another run  because in order to get\na longer run than him  we wouldn't be able to nab him\nbefore the end of the game. So the game will just be over. The game is four days. So we have to find him. Well  I've arrived in\nwhat I think is going to be quite the annoying spot\nfor a bunch of reasons. All of which I will\nexplain in the morning. Good night! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Alright look \nthe stakes are simple. If we don't catch Sam tomorrow  the game ends and he wins. Is that what's gonna happen? You could find out\nright now on Nebula  because next episode is up\nright now on Nebula  just like every week  because every episode\nof Jet Lag goes up one week early on Nebula! And in addition to watching\nnext episode right now  you can also listen to our after-show podcast \nThe Layover  where we get into the\nbehind-the-scenes. We dive into our strategy. And you're going to want\nto hear a little bit about our strategy next round. 'Cause it's going to\nget really important. And I think that we've\ngot a  you know... We've got a distinct strategy. And you'll find out\nwhat it is next episode. Again  could find out\nright now on Nebula. And we talk about it even\nmore on The Layover  so... Something to entice you.\nSomething to entice you. Are you enticed? If you're not enticed \nyou might want to know that there's a whole bunch\nmore amazing stuff on Nebula from all of your favorite creators. We got Brian from\nReal Engineering. You might remember\nhim from the show. We got Joseph from\nRealLifeLore. You might remember\nhim from the show. We got Toby from the show. She's on there.\nShe's talking about math. Scotty's on the show also \nand on Nebula as well. You got all of\nyour favorite creators making original content on here. And people  guess what? It doesn't cost a million dollars. It's affordable. It's so dang affordable that it only costs $30\nfor the whole year. The whole year?\nFor the whole year. That's $2.50 a month  but... It only costs that\nif you use our code. If you go to nebula.tv/jetlag because if you don't use our code \nthen it's $50 for the year. Which is still a very good deal \nbut is more than $30. And when you use our code  you're also helping\nto support the show because that tells Nebula\nthat Jet Lag sent you. And then we get a portion\nof your subscription for the whole time that\nyou stay subscribed  which helps us\nto support the show. And that is good...\ntheoretically. Hopefully you would want us\nto keep making the show ...if you're watching it.\nThat's true. So theoretically  this is\na win-win for everybody. You can fit so much\ncontent in this bad boy. Can we put—\nOkay  wait  I have an idea. And I want us to keep\nall this in  okay. Post production team \ncan you put a box that has 'Nebula' on it here  and then watch\nwhat I'm going to do? You can fit so much\ncontent in this bad boy! Well  that just sold me.\nYeah. You know  the link's on screen. You can see it right there. Just go ahead and click on it. It would be really good\nif you did that. We would really like it\nif you did that. And if you didn't do it \nwe would be really sad. You can't say that!\nIt would be: If you don't click on it \nit's okay. But we would prefer it\nif you clicked on it. Does that make sense? Yeah  I think that seems right. Mm. Okay  well bye.\nBye!"

        "transcript": "Hello  and\nwelcome to episode four of hide-and-seek\nacross Switzerland. Right now  we're exactly\nhalfway through the game with two days remaining. I'm about to start my\nfirst run as Hider  and the stakes couldn't be higher. If I can last until\nthe end of the day  I'll win the game\nright then and there. There wouldn't be enough\ntime left in our four days for either Ben or Adam to\nget back into first place. But that's not gonna be easy. Ben and Adam are planning on\nplaying aggressively this round  so I've gotta hope that\nI've picked the right hiding spot. And we are... so back! So I think it's worth narrating what Ben and Adam\nare doing right now. At least  I think  so  you know. They're starting at the playground.\nWe know that. (softly)\nHello  good morning. We're talking quietly because we're in an extremely\nresidential area. And we're just on a playground  which feels creepy anyway.\nYeah. And Adam is probably\nstarting by saying something like  \"Ben  the first train\nout of here is in five minutes  and we're an\neight-minute walk away  so we gotta run.\" And as soon as\nthe clock strikes 7:30  we gotta run to the train station because there is a train\nin five minutes to Lucerne. That's true.\nWe know that from yesterday. So they can make it  but it's going to be\ntight and stressful. (quietly)\nAlright  go  go  go! Okay. And... I think there's maybe\na 50-50 shot Ben is clutching his hat\nlike this. Who knows? (metal crashing) (laughs) No! Yeah. (metal clattering)\nOh dear. I didn't even see that. Okay  that's fine. (wheezes) Keep going  keep going. I think they're gonna make it? I think they're gonna make it. But  you know  we'll see. What? Where our turn is \ndo you remember? No  I think it's up here. (breathes exhaustedly) I totally got the wind\nknocked out of me. And I ran into that sign. It's okay. Oh  it's so dark. Alright  Ben \nlet's ask the rhyme question. I still think\nthat asking that first is the best strat. Okay  we're buying the rhymes. Alright  they've\nasked for rhymes. Which is not a surprising start  'cause I think we agree that\nthat's a very good start. However  because of that  I prepared for these\nyesterday on my way here  and I already have the words. One of the reasons\nI liked it here was because it had a very\ncommon ending to its name. That applies to a lot\nof other places too. Anyway  we'll send it over shortly. Luxembourg \nEndomorph  Hawk  Pen  Monsieur. Doesn't rhyme with Basel. Et cetera  et cetera. Let's hit him with longitude. Yeah  I mean  this is\nstill going to determine what direction we go next. Right now \nBen and Adam have determined that they just need to keep me\nunder 250 total coins  because that's when the likelihood of rolling top-tier curses\nbecomes too high. But until then \nthey've decided to ask whatever questions they want. Let's hit him with longitude. Alright  question\nnumber two: longitude. Another thing\nthat I thought about  I've gone to an area that has... quite a lot of train lines. There are quite a lot\nof options around here. So longitude \nit'll narrow it down a bit  but not massively. Alright Ben \nSam is east of us. Okay  well then we should\nprobably head towards Zürich. We should probably head\ntowards the general Zürich area. But unfortunately  east is a little more complicated than\nif he had been west of us. I was really hoping\nhe was going to be west. I had more of a plan for west. I mean  one thing\nwe could do  Ben... We could do geographic region. Find out if he's\nup here or down here. Because I think we agree\nit's more likely he's north. Well... I think in that case  what might be more\nuseful is to do... canton region. No  because\nwe're in this region  and I don't think he's here. And I'm saying if we just\ngo up into the Zürich area. But then we have to go\nto Zürich. I know  but... I think that there's a\nvery  very  very good chance that he's in there.\nAnd if he's not  that tells us a lot of information. Okay. We're in Lucerne. Let's get off  figure out\nour next move. Okay  welcome back\nto Lucerne. I think the next thing\nthat we really want to know is just basically  is he\nnorth of us or south of us? Is he in the sort of\ndense Zürich-y area? Or is he way down in the\nfar reaches of whatever? I think he's in the\ndense Zürich-y area. I think he's almost\ndefinitely around there. But even then  it's a\nmatter of figuring out... Yeah.\nIs he near Winterthur  or is he in one of the suburbs? Yeah. Alright. I actually really need\nto go to the bathroom. Okay  you do that. Alright  well  it seems like they're holding off on\nadditional questions for now. So  let's talk strategy. So  I have one very major\ndisadvantage in this game  which is that  at this point  it seems almost impossible\nthat I'll get a second run. The one advantage\nthat I have  though  is I have two rounds\nthat I have learned from. And I feel like\nI've learned a lot about how to position\nmyself in the right place to make it as difficult\nas possible for them. One thing that I noticed\nis both of them  they went basically to the\nmaximum theoretical distance that they could go \nbased on their transition time. I didn't. I could've gone\nfurther than this. Not by too much  but I'm\nnot at the theoretical limit of how far I could go. The long game  I don't think is\ngoing to be too difficult for them. The medium game  though... That's going to be tricky. 'Cause there's just\nso many rail lines around this area of the country. So many places. It's one of the densest areas. Even once they narrow\nit down to here  I've come to a city. I saw how difficult\nit was to narrow down in just that small place\nwith only so many streets yesterday with Ben. I've come to a place that has\nway more streets  way more density  way more options for\nwhere I can be. So  it's gonna be tricky.\nWe'll see. Adam  welcome back\nfrom the bathroom. How was it? You know  a life hack. Always go to\nthe bathroom on a train because they made me pay. Okay Ben \nwhat do we want to do? I mean  maybe we\nshould just ask a question to confirm that he's not south. I think we definitely need\nto confirm he's not south. Okay  in that case  if we really want to\nconfirm that he's not south  then I do think that the... geographic region question will cleanly eliminate\nbasically all of that. Yeah  but we have to\nwait another nine minutes before we can ask that question. Well  they've\nmade it to Lucerne. So it'll be interesting\nto see where they go next. I mean  the correct place for them to go next\nwould be Zürich. And that would be\nfairly intuitive. And I wouldn't be\ntoo concerned because there are just\nso many options out of Zürich. I'd only get concerned \nkind of  if they get on the right\nline out of Zürich. Do you want to... hop on a train toward Zürich? (huffs)\nI mean  it's a little risky. But I think that the chance that he is that direction\nis very high. Okay  when's the\nnext train to Zürich? It's in three minutes. Oh goodness  okay. So  why don't we go for it? Okay  right here  right here. Okay  so... Our train to Zürich is leaving. But we need to ask\na question now to confirm whether or not\nhe's north of us. So  we're buying\nthe information of whether or not he's in the\nsame geographic region as us. So  like  if he says\nhe's in the Alps  that does mean that\nhe's south of us  but... If he's in the Plateau  then it does mean that\nwe're going the right way. Alright  new question. No  it went away.\nBut they asked whether we're in\nthe same geographic region. I'm not actually sure.\nLet's check. Alright. He should be\nanswering us any second. Yes  he's in the Plateau. Okay  that's good to know.\nOkay. And that significantly\nlimits his region. (marker scribbling) Yeah. Yeah  I mean... We've given him  you know  a decent number of coins \nbut not too many. Look  he might even\nbe celebrating right now. He might be like \n\"Great  I have all these coins.\" But we're coming for\nyour ass  Sam. I'm already at 90 coins  'cause that's two\ncomparative questions plus an oddball.\nThat's 90 coins. I'm almost to a\ntwo-dice roll curse. I'm guessing \nbased on yesterday  they're gonna take an approach of asking a ton of questions\nto try to narrow me down  which means that I can just\npepper them with curses  and potentially roll\na pretty devastating one. We'll see. Alright  well  it seems like\nthey're on a train out of Lucerne  I think to Zürich\nbased on the timing. Not 100% sure. But  I'm gonna use\nthis opportunity to start surveying my zone. You know  looking for\nhiding spots. What do I get here? You know  all that. And  my first destination  which I think might be\na great hiding spot  is right in front of me. The forest. So again  we're sort of\nplaying Guess Who here. You ever play Guess Who? Where you're trying to be like \n\"Are you bald?\" It's that game.\nYeah. Mark Rober made a\ngreat video about Guess Who. And what he said is  the\nbest way to play Guess Who is with each question \ntry to eliminate 50% of all possibilities. Yeah  and so \nwith every question  we're just trying to cut off\nhalf the map  and... I do think that the best way of cutting off the\nnext half of the map is to ask a 25-mile radius\nright about now. I think that that is right. Because that\nwould basically tell us  are you here \nor are you out here? Right. Either way  I would\nquite like to know the answer. It cuts about halfway through\nthe northern Zürich suburbs. Right  but again  I think\nwe're being right to just... don't fear buying information. No. Buy the information\nimmediately. We will worry about curses later. As long as we keep it\nunder 300 coins  I think we are\nnot really in danger. Yep. Ooh  they've asked\nfor a radar. And they've asked\nfor a 25-mile radar. I think I'm outside of that.\nLet me check. Ooh  okay  it's gonna be\na miss  but just barely. Oh  that's gonna be\nreally misleading. Because it's like \nthey clearly thought maybe I was in the\ngreater Zürich area  and I kind of am. Anyway  I think this is\ngonna trip them up. That's lucky. Okay  so... This is interesting.\nThe radius was a miss. I actually think that's\nreally good news. I think that is\nreally helpful information. That means he is not... in Zürich. And he's not in sort of the\nnorthern Zürich suburbs. Okay  I need to try... I think I think that means\nwe want to go to Winterthur. Probably. Yeah  this is\nlooking promising. So  from here you can see the other key advantage\nof my zone. Not only are there woods here \nbut over there too. So there are two zones of woods that they're gonna have to search. Okay  I'm gonna poke\ninto these woods a bit to see...\nwhat it would look like to hide in them. I kinda like this spot. I'm gonna take a\nmental note of it  but... Let's go poke around\nour zone some more. Okay  welcome to Zürich. For the first time\nin the game. Well  maybe.\nSam might've been here. That's true. Was he here? Let us know. He almost certainly\nwent through Zürich  wherever he went. Yeah.\nHe's up here. We've boxed him in\npretty good  but now there's... dozens and dozens\nand dozens of towns. Lots of places he could be. I mean  I really hope\nhe's not here. Probably not.\nProbably not. That would be annoying. There are a few options. We could ask the canton question and eliminate all of this. Yep.\nOr confirm it. I think that would\nnot be a bad idea. No  I mean that gets us\npretty close to half the— Or we could go to Winterthur and do a 10-mile radar. Yeah.\nWhich is slightly cheaper. There's a good chance  I mean  I feel like one of our\ntop theories at this point is that he's in\none of the weird towns outside of Winterthur. One other thing we could do is we could split the remaining\nterritory down the middle by asking if he's\nnear the same International airport.\n'Cause there's one in Zürich  and there's one in\nSt. Gallen  here. And we could find out\nif he's here or here  but... (squacks) I don't know! I mean... Maybe we just need to\nstick to our guns of eliminating 50%. I agree. And eliminating 50%\nwould mean the airport question would\neliminate closest to 50%. But the thing is \nit's 50% of the area. I don't know that it's\n50% of the options. Ugh  let's look at\nthe maps again. Look  we're at the\npoint where we have to be very careful\nabout the questions that we ask. Well  looks like\nthey made it to Zürich. Which is... I don't think I should be\ntoo concerned about that  'cause it was kind of\nthe most obvious train to the east from Lucerne. So it'll be interesting to see\nwhich train out of there they take. I don't think they have\nnearly enough info to figure out where I am yet  unless they had\na really good guess. I feel pretty good\nabout asking the canton. But  I don't know  it's like \nthere's all this (bleep) But I guess he couldn't\nbe in any of this. I don't think he could\nquite be in any of this. But—\nI think he could be here. Yeah  I like canton. That's expensive  but I think\nit's the most useful question. I think that that's\nprobably the closest to eliminating\n50% of possibilities. (sighs) Okay  let's do it. Alright  new question. Same canton? I'm not sure  let's check. We should be prepared\nto go to Winterthur. Yeah  I honestly think\nwe should go to Winterthur  kind of  no matter what.\nOkay. Sam?\nUgh. Are you in the\nsame canton as us? Sam?\nWhat do you hope he says? I hope he says yes  probably. Okay  well that's unfortunate. They got me. It's a big canton though \nwith a lot of stuff  so... That still could take 'em a bit  but that really narrows\nit down for them. Anyway. That's how the jets lag. You wanna go? Yeah  yeah.\nAlright  let's go. Let's do it. Alright  off to Winterthur. Alright. Okay. Ben  he is in\nthe same canton as us which continues to be\nuseful information. I mean  that cuts off\na big old chunk. Well  you're probably seeing\na motion graphic version of this  but he's somewhere in here. I think that is quite\nuseful information. We're zeroing in on him. I think once we get\nto Winterthur  maybe a 5-mile radar\nor something. I mean  certainly if he's not\nwithin five miles of Winterthur  then  I don't know where... I don't know where he could be. I think that\nthe real question is... what is this rough size of\nthe place that he is in? Right. A photo of the train station\nmight be helpful for that. I like photo of the\ntrain station regardless. 'Cause it's a great way to check. 'Cause you can check... It's always useful to check. Okay. Let's ask for a photo\nof the train station. I think that  you know  we're gonna need that photo\nat a certain point. Yeah  might as well\nget it now. Might as well get it now\nwhile we're on our way. Yeah. We're still in safe territory. Mostly safe territory. To be clear. Mostly safe. Okay  well \nI basically just made it to wood zone number two  and was gonna start\nsurveying  but... they asked for a photo\nof the train station. And I think I have some\nideas about how to make it ...not that indicative. Okay  so here's my thinking. Outside of this station\nis all kind of the same style of brick\nand windows and everything  so I think any exterior shot is\ngoing to be pretty indicative. But... We are allowed interior shots. And you can see in here. And I looked on Google. There's not a single\nphoto of this interior. (camera click) Much like Ben's yesterday  I don't think that a shot\nof that would be useful until they're here \nwhich is what I want. So I think I'm gonna try that. See how that works. Hello  and welcome\nto Winterthur. (coughs) Okay  well Sam\njust sent us a picture  and I think it's pretty useful. This is a picture of\nthe train station. Well  it's telling...\nWhich tells me... It's probably not a\nsuper rural station. (sighs) Maybe he's here? I mean  there are ways we\ncould find out if he's here. (sighs) Well... Okay  small problem. Actually  you know what?\nI'll change that. I might characterize\nthat as major problem. Eeehhh... They're downtown. How did they guess this place? Aw  man. That is bad. I think I'm gonna start\nwalking towards the forest. Just in case  you know? I think what we should do is  I think about half of the\nremaining train stations are within five miles of here. I think about half\nare outside of it. I agree. It's certainly densest\nclosest to right here. So I kind of think...\nwe hit him with the radar. Either way \nwe then make a list of every remaining train station\nthat also rhymes. I think then \nwe find some clever way to use an oddball or photo\nto eliminate half of those. I think that's...\nThat's kind of my opinion. I think that that's doable.\nBut I agree. I think that probably the\nmost sensible thing to do is just to drop\na small radius here Yeah.\nand just see... Is he close to Winterthur  or is he in the sort of outskirts? But I will remind you.\nI mean  30... A radar puts him at 205. I don't want to let him\nget to 250 if we can avoid it.\nI agree. I think under no circumstances\ncan we let him get to 300. Because if he's at 300 \nhe has a 50% chance of being allowed to move\nhis hiding spot. Which would be a true disaster. Let's go ahead\nand put down that... You want to.\nPut down that radar. Okay  let's do it. They did a 5-mile radar. I don't think\nI'm escaping this one. How did they guess here\nfirst out of everywhere? That—\nThere has to have been some luck involved\nin that  right? Oh  man. Alright. I'm gonna let them know. Alright  answer should be\ncoming any minute. Mmm  I'm hungry. You wanna get some food? Yeah. I mean  here. Is this a coffee shop? Yeah  okay.\nLooks like it. Ooh. It's a hit  Ben. Folks  it's a hit.\nIt's a hit. So that means we are within\nfive miles of Sam right now. Look  we're two hours in. We're within five miles\nof the man. I feel pretty good about that. Here's what I'll say.\nWe're two hours in right now. I'm doubtful that he'll\nmake it ten hours. Unless it takes us\neight hours to figure out— Just don't say anything.\nYeah  you're right. Just don't say anything.\nLet's sit down and make a list of\nwhere he could be. Okay. To be honest  I don't think\nthis is going to be a winning run. But  I actually have the money – or the coins rather –\nfor four dice. He's going to be very\nexcited about all these coins. With four dice \npretty good chance that he could roll\nsomething pretty good. The curses start\ngetting bad around 17  they start to really get messy. I think he has\na pretty solid chance of hitting at least a 17 with 4. Yeah. So  I think I might as well\nsee what curse I get. See if that can at least\nget me a little something. Here we go. This is kind of\nthe last Hail Mary. Oh  that doesn't look good. Swiss cheese curse. Before you ask your next question  you must acquire\n8 ounces of Swiss cheese and fill in all of its holes\non the outside – you may break it open\nto make holes – with other types of cheese. You may not advance in the game until you have a\nsolid block of cheese from outward appearance. (sputters) I feel like... again... They have to have gotten at\nleast a little bit lucky  right? Okay.\nWell... We were about to\nsit down for some coffee  but he's hit us with a curse. Which to me  incredible news because it means he has\nspent at least two dice. We actually don't have\nto do this curse right now because this is just before\nwe ask our next question. Yeah  but let's just\nknock it out. There's a cheese shop\nright there. (laughs uproariously) Sorry  Sam. Aw  dude  that\ntotally sucks for you  man! Thank you.\nThank you. You ready to look like lunatics? Yeah  that's what we do best! You gotta imagine he was\nnot pleased with that. No  that's... (laughs) That's a brutal roll.\nIt's also like... I don't know\nif he rolled two dice. I don't know if he rolled three.\nI don't know if he rolled four. I kinda bet he rolled four. There is a chance\nthat he rolled four. And if he rolled four \nI'm so sorry  Sam. This sucks. Ah  damn it. Another thing I would say\nfor Sam  unfortunately  and maybe he's in Winterthur  maybe that's why he\ndid this  but... Don't hit us with a curse when we're in the\nmiddle of a dense city. That actually makes me think that he might be in Winterthur. Maybe he thinks that we're\nin the endgame now. If he's hitting us with a curse now. It's possible. Do you want to do it  or shall I? Okay  here we go. We're opening our cheese. It turns out in Switzerland \nthey do not call it Swiss cheese. Yeah  we were in the store \nand we were like  \"There's not one\nlabeled Swiss cheese. What do we do?\" No  only America\nhas the audacity to name a cheese after itself. And now there's a problem. As you can see \nit's full of holes. Right. Seemingly\na manufacturing error  I would assume. But we are\ngonna go ahead and fix that for you \nSwitzerland. Wow  you really\ncan smell that cheese. Yeah. Alright  your hands\nare gonna get a little messy. Yeah  I think that's just  you know \nan occupational hazard. And we're just gonna\ngo ahead and... fill up our holes here. I hope it\nmakes him feel better that it's kind of\nunpleasant for you. Yeah  well... No  it's pleasant. Alright  I believe... We've done it. That's a solid block of cheese. Switzerland  you are welcome. We have gone ahead\nand fixed your cheese. We went ahead\nand fixed your cheese. Now it's good for eating. Yeah. Curse complete. That took  what \nten minutes? Yeah. Alright  I think now\nlet's go to the coffee shop and figure out what to do next. Alright  well... I would say so far \nthings have gone quite well. I mean  the fact that\nhe used those cursed dice is... I would argue  great for us\nand a massive mistake for him. But honestly... Unless he's here. The only reason I can think\nthat he would do that— It doesn't make sense. Unless he's here. He either did something stupid \nor he's here. But we can go check the\ntrain station for that photo. Well  that's\none thing we can do. Another thing we can do is we can ask him for\na picture of a McDonald's because almost\nanywhere in Winterthur will be within a mile\nof a McDonald's. And none of those other towns\nhave McDonald's  right? I'm pretty sure\nthat that is the case. Let's ask for a photo\nof a McDonald's. Okay. Photo of McDonald's. And honestly  that  if he is here  that can\nhelp us figure out what part of town he's in. Yeah. Alright. They're asking for\na photo from McDonald's. There's one in the zone. Let's go get it. Alright  I have arrived\nat the McDonald's. Let's find a nice\nfive-foot tranche. It's hard to identify windows. Maybe the windows and\nthat little poster. Yeah  let's do that. (camera click) Alright  I'm gonna go\nwalk to the woods. To at least be\nnear my hiding spot for once they trend here. Okay  he sent us—\nHe's by a McDonald's. He sent us a photo\nof a McDonald's  which means that\nhe is in Winterthur. Oh  Sam. Oh  buddy. But that explains why\nhe used the curse on us. Yeah  it does. Okay  well  I figure\nwe can figure out which McDonald's this is. We're right\nnext to one of them. There's four. We're not allowed\nto use Street View. We're allowed to look\nat pictures  but I think he has\nvery intentionally— Ooh—! Is that it? I mean  those are\nthe same benches. Which one is that?\nSame benches. Same ground. I think it's this one. The man's in trouble. I mean  here's what I will say. We have not yet played\nan endgame in a dense urban area. It could be quite difficult. And it's still very possible\nhe could get second. We are not outta the woods. Alright  back at the forest. This is where I was almost before they sent me\nto the station. This is kind of the more\nconvoluted forest to get to. So I'm hoping that  you know  once they probably ask\na precision question that shows that I'm\nin the forest  they'll go start searching\nthe other one first. We'll see. But... Hopefully I can find a\nnice  dense spot in here. Alright. Really gaining\nsome altitude here. This path that I'm on isn't even marked on\nGoogle Maps. So... Hopefully it's a bit\ntricky to find? And then I think\nI'll find a good spot... you know  actually in the woods. Alright  Ben. Let's kick it. So we're what  we're\njust over three hours in? I think that we can\nget him before four and a half \nwhich was my time. I think so too. I would  because again  I really would like to remain\nat least in second place. Unless he's picked\na really amazing hiding spot. In fact  you know what? I bet that's exactly\nwhat he's going for. Alright  six minutes\nfrom McDonald's. I mean  we should\nbe entering the endgame any moment  really. Well  they're\ngoing the wrong way. (record scratch) Which is promising. It looks like they're walking\nto another McDonald's that kind of has a similar profile in that it's near a secondary\nstation in the city. Not the main station. But they're not walking\nto the right one. They're walking  in fact \nexactly away from me. So they're now almost\ntwo miles away. They're on completely the\nother side of the city. It's looking promising. I'm not seeing benches right now  but I think they're\nprobably in the back. I sure hope\nthis McDonald's matches. Because if it doesn't  that's\ngoing to be really annoying. At about this moment  Ben and Adam are\ngoing to realize... that they're at the\nwrong McDonald's. Sorry  guys. There was that sign. A guy running. I don't see a guy running. No running guy? Not promising.\nNo. He might have tricked us. Let's double check. There's a reflection\nin the window of a barricade. Alright. Yeah  I see that. And it's a\ndifferent kind of fence. Ooh. I think I got it. I think it's this one. Okay  we'll head out there. Okay. Yeah  he got our asses. Well  now things get\na little more interesting in terms of if we can find him... in time for second place. Okay  yeah. We can take a train over there. Okay  great. It's a little annoying. Okay  let's get on this train\nand get to his McDonald's. So  in order to make it\nto second place... It's 10:55 now. I need to make it\nuntil 12:14. Which is not that much longer. I mean  that feels...\npossible  right? Okay  so it was just a\nlittle bit of research  and it looks like\nthey definitely had some bad luck with\na 50-50 shot because there are only\nfour McDonald's within the 5-mile radius. That one's in the city center  so it clearly would not\nmatch that photo. That one's in a mall \nalso clearly would not match. So they're basically these two\nthat would match. I photoed this one.\nThey went to this one. That's pretty bad luck. That does  however  mean that they're almost\ncertainly headed here now. This is us. Just one stop. Alright  Sam  this better be\nthe (bleep) right McDonald's. Alright  Ben. Well  now  it's a 16 minute walk\nto the other McDonald's. Excellent. Coming for you  Sam  finally. Alright  they're nearly at\nthe close McDonald's. Which... tells me that they're\nabout to find out that they're basically\nin the endgame. So it's time to find\na nice  cozy spot in the woods. I'm gonna leave the path here\nand push into the woods. I think the further  the better. Need it to be thicc! T-H-I-C-C. I think that's it. It's the same kind— See? That's it. That's it  alright. Wait  wait  I've always\nwanted to do this. I've always wanted to\ndo the thing that... \"Sam's been here.\"\nYou know? Like detectives do.\nOh sure  okay  yeah. Okay  great. Let's find him. Alright. Found a nice little spot here. And I think  if I lie down... it shouldn't be visible from the paths around here. I think. I think let's start with street. Yeah  we'll get a street \nbecause that'll give us... And we can start looking. Maybe a direction to go. Alright. They've asked for\nthe letter of the first street. Which is 'A'. Hopefully there are\na lot of 'A' streets around. And at least I don't think\nthat'll be very useful  but it might narrow them down to this set of woods\nversus the other. But then there's also\nthis giant park in his area. Yeah. And it would be\nvery much like Sam to go hide in a park. Yeah  to hike. 'Cause I think it's\na mountain. I don't even know\nthat it's a park. I think it just sort of is\na mountain. Nearest street  'A'  okay. Do any of the streets in\nthe park start with 'A'? No. Not that I... can tell. Not that I see. Hold on  just really quick. Here's something that\nno one has realized yet. The 'A' street that I'm near\n– Auenrainstrasse – is really small.\nSo small  in fact  that its name won't show up\non Google Maps unless you zoom\nall the way in to check it. And that's about to spell\ntrouble for Ben and Adam. What are streets around here\nthat start with 'A'? There's Anton-Graff-Strasse. There's Agnesstrasse\nand Ankerstrasse. Did you get Albrechtstrasse? I just want to make sure\nthat he's not in the park. I think that he can't be. I mean  I still think the\nphoto might be the best. Okay  photo.\nPhoto up or back? Probably... ba... What do you think? I think let's hit him\nwith an up actually. Okay. 'Cause he's\nprobably near buildings. Alright  they're asking\nfor a photo up. This is gonna be... This is gonna give away a lot. (camera click) I would just say again  we don't have the most\ntime ever to find him. No. In order for me to stay\nin second place  we need to find him\nin the next 45-ish minutes. Okay  we got the photo. Oh  those are trees. It's all trees. It's all trees. Big time tree situation. Huh  okay. That's helpful.\nThat's interesting. But I really don't\nthink that  I mean... Maybe we need\nto look real closely. What about this? Amselweg. Amselweg? Ooh. Yeah  I like that. I like that. I mean  right now \nI don't see any other place that qualifies. But I don't wanna go\nall the way over there. It's gonna be a long walk\nif we're wrong. Can we do\nwalk to the train station? How long would it take you\nto walk to the train station? I think let's ask him that \nand let's start heading that way. Okay? Okay. Yeah. I don't  I mean...\nWe gotta find him in time. I think that... I don't see any other\nplaces that he could be. Next question: How long\nto walk to the train station? Let's see what it says. Hm. Yeah  because\nGoogle doesn't have all of the paths marked out\nkind of in this area. So it thinks it takes longer\nthan it does  basically. Did you check how far of a walk it is from the train station \nif we are right? So I think anything \nyeah  anything in that  within a couple minutes\nof that  we keep going. 31 minutes. Okay  so it can't be that. Well... Probably not  but... Yeah. Hold on.\nProbably not. Hold on. Let's re-evaluate. Now I'm getting really nervous\nabout finding him in time. Yeah  yeah. Okay. Here's the thing. There are not a lot of places\nthat are going to be that far of a walk\nfrom the train station. Come on! They're still\nin this random park. It really feels like they're\nwasting a lot of time there. We have to find him\nin the next 14 minutes  Ben. I think we just need to\nguess in a direction. I think we need to\nstart walking north. And just hope that\nthat works or something. It's 14 minutes or nothing. Alright  we need to figure out... Just another question. But he's for sure\nin the woods. I think we should\nask for street orientation. Okay  good news. Actually  let's do bad news first. Bad news is it's raining. The good news is that it's getting very close\nto my second place time. And they're not even going\nin the right direction. This is great. I'm imagining they're... It's kind of hard to spot the road that I'm\nclosest to on the map because it's so close\nto another road. I'm imagining that might\nbe tripping them up. We'll see.\nBut they just asked for the intercardinal direction\nto that road  so I'll give that to them next. Oh  Ben. What? Where? Where could he be?! Wait  wait  wait? What is this? Is this a park? It might be.\nI think it's somebody's yard. But it says park. Let's go there. Well  the trees don't\nlook right  but whatever. Let's just start walking there. At a minimum. Woah. I mean  I still just don't know. I don't know either  man. It's nearly time. Wait  let me pull out my watch. (rain dripping) Well  Ben  it's 12:14  which means Sam has\nslid into second place. It's 12:14. Do you know\nwhat that means? That's second place! Let's go! Well... I mean  I still\nneed to deny Adam a better time\nwith his next run. But  they're still not here. And that's me officially\nin second place. Better than I thought\nwas possible a couple hours ago. So  let's see\nhow long this takes. Oh  if we hadn't gone\nto the wrong McDonald's! I think we could've done it. Look  I think we're\ngonna catch him today  which means you'll get\nanother shot. Which means... you can still supplant him. Well  I can still\nsupplant you  even. That is true. Less likely. The thing is \nwe are on an 'A' street  and that's the woods-woods. But—\nYou just go down this path. But this path had the street\nI believe. Does that path not have a name? Well  it looks like\nthey're searching a completely different\nset of woods that is actually\noutside of my zone. They don't know that. That is next to another\nroad that starts with 'A'. And all that. This just keeps getting\nbetter and better. It's really just like... Where the (bleep)\ndo we go? So  Ben and Adam kept looking  and still unable to find\nthe right streets  they bought a half-mile radar to see if they were even\nin the right part of town. Alright  little update. First of all  I realized I could shove my umbrella\ndown my back. And then I wouldn't have\nto hold it all this time. Second of all  they just\nasked for a half-mile radar  which they are not\neven close to within. Ben  our radar was a miss. Okay. Now knowing they\nwere nowhere close  they turned their sights\non the other side of town. And after a long research session  they finally found something. Wait. What? What about\nAuen...rainstrasse? He could be on—\nYeah. Yeah. Ben  look. This path doesn't have a name. But if he was on it  he would\nbe nearest to Auenrainstrasse. Okay  that's it. And then he would be far from the (bleep)-ing\ntrain station. That's where he is.\nLet's go get him. (whispering)\n(bleep) you  Sam. So  confident\nabout my location  they set off on an\nhour-long trek to the base of the mountain. (sighs) I cannot believe\nit's gonna take an hour to walk over there. Uuuggh! For me personally  Ben \nthis sucks. The thing is  he can't actually\nbe that deep into the woods. It's actually... The sun has come out \nwhich is nice. Kind of cold still  but  you know. I didn't expect to be stuck\nin the endgame for so long. So I didn't really\nbring many snacks. Basically the only thing\nI have are Sports Beans. I don't know if you've\never heard of Sports Beans  but they're made by\njelly beans or  you know  Jelly Belly. So  I guess this is an\nimpromptu episode of... (mumbling) Choo Choo Chew: Derailed. Definitely not Snack Zone. Delicious. I kinda hope they get here soon. I want some lunch. I also wanna win though. Okay  we are\napproaching the woods. The big question... Which direction do we go? I actually think\nwe need to go left. Well  I guess\none question is how deep is he into the woods? We could ask him how many\nfeet from the road he is. That might be useful.\nYou want to? Yeah. Okay  here  you go for it. Well  they've asked me how many feet I am\nto the nearest road  which might help them. I don't know  we'll see. Alright  I have enough money\nfor a two-dice roll curse. I think I'm gonna wait. 'Cause they kinda get\nexponentially worse. And I think they're\ngoing to have to ask a good number more\nprecision questions to have any good shot\nof finding me. He's 860 feet\nfrom the nearest road. (bleep) Well... That would mean he's pretty far. (weakly)\nOh Sam  you bastard. Oh my god. We're close. We're a\nfour-minute walk away. I'm gonna stump it up. Okay. We're almost there. Well  I think we're almost there. Won't it be annoying if we're not? The only thing\nthat makes me feel good about Sam being at\nthe top of this is I know that he thinks\nthat shiz— this (bleep) is funny. Ugh. Alright  we're starting\nto get quite close. So I'm laying down\nso that hopefully... it'll reduce my\nvisibility from the path that you know  they're\nprobably gonna be on. We just have to\nget around this bend. He should be on the other side. He better be around this corner. Okay  they're\ngetting pretty close. No  it should be\nright around here. I don't see him. He shouldn't be able\nto see me from there. But once they get\na little bit closer  I'll probably be within eyesight. He might be the other way. I think we just need to\nwalk up here a little ways. Before we count it out. They're at the right\ndistance from the road now. So they just need to\ncome kind of this way. I wonder if they'll go\nthrough the forest. They might come over\nthat ridge over there. So  I'm sure that we've\ncut this down a lot  but I just want to emphasize that we've been in the\nwoods for so long now. We've been in the woods for a truly outrageous\namount of time. How long have we been\nin the woods  Ben? I don't want to know. At least 45 minutes. Wait  is that\nhis (bleep) umbrella? We got him. No  that's just a guy.\nNo  that's a guy. No  that's a guy with his dog. No  Ben  it's just\na guy with his dog. It's simply a man with his dog. Oh  I thought that was Sam. That sucks a lot. Oh  I wish that man was Sam. I was so confident. We really need to reevaluate. Okay. Despite being\nonly 400 feet from me  they still couldn't find me. So they asked question... We're asking him his distance\nfrom his nearest intersection. After question... We're asking if he's\non the same street as us. After question... Do you wanna ask him\nany more (bleep) stuff? And got lost again... Wait. Oh  sorry.\nI think it's this path. Oh  okay. Well  it's actually \nit's hard to tell. And again... I mean... Nothing? Nothing here! And again... Look man  I don't know. I am doing my best. And again... This is hell  Ben.\nWe're living in hell. And again. I'm gonna ask these\npeople if they've seen Sam. Excuse me! Hi. Have you seen our friend? We're looking for our friend \na blond man? Well  I've now been here for... three and— more than\nthree and a half hours. I do feel bad for them because I know\nhow much it sucked to be searching for Ben\nfor two hours yesterday. And it's been\na lot more than that  and they've covered\na lot more ground. I'm sure they're getting tired\nand frustrated and all that. I'm gonna kill Sam. I'm going to kill him dead. Meanwhile  while\nI considered continuing to hold out for 150 coins\nso I could roll three dice  I ultimately decided to\ngo for a two-dice roll. Alright  here we go. Ugh  three  come on \nthat's ridiculous. What is that? Swiss clock. Before you ask your next question  you must clap 15 seconds after your other team member\nstarts a timer  within 0.5 seconds \non each side of 15 seconds. If you fail  you must wait at least 10 minutes\nbefore reattempting. Okay  they're\ncoming closer again. This might be it. (whispering)\nI think I hear them. I see his umbrella. I think that's his umbrella. Oh  I just heard him say\nhe sees an umbrella. (wheezes)\nI think he's coming. There they are. Wait  there they are. There they are. Oh my god  Sam. How dare you do this to us. I had a great time\nin the woods. Ugh  yeah. I'm sure. Oh my god  dude. I'm stuck in a bramble. (giggles)\nHi  Sam. I think it's very difficult\nfor you  from your side of it  to understand\njust how hard it is to figure this out\nfrom our side. Yes. I mean  it's supposed to be hard. I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at you.\nI'm just... Anyway  you got\nsome running to do. The main station is a\n51-minute walk from here. Yeah. So you should probably go. Alright guys.\nGood luck  Adam. Not just not such good luck\nthat you got first place. See you never.\nAlright  let's do this. You got this. Go somewhere\nin Switzerland. Oh my god \nthis sucks so much. He's zooming.\nHe really is zooming. Good luck  Adam. All it really comes down to is: if we catch Adam early tomorrow  I'm still in first \nand you're still in second. But if we can't make that happen  he could win the whole thing. Yeah  which... he would\nreally gloat about. He would. Look  it's the...\nThe wins go to his head. But the solo wins \noh the solo wins. Alright  let's do it. There's a train in\nnine minutes. The second I get here \nI have to run. It's a high-risk move. It's a high-risk move. I think I made it. I made it. God  I hope this works. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Ben and Adam\nare about to leave. I'm at the airport. But I forgot\nto mention to them that the finale is up\non Nebula right now. And they have a really long flight. It's like 15  16 hours. Oh my gosh  Ben \nwe're about to board our flight  but we don't have\nanything to watch! This flight's\ngonna be super long. I'm gonna get so bored \nI'm gonna go cuckoo. If only there was a solution that would give us\nsomething to watch. And the finale's up\non Nebula right now. And they can download it \nyou know  using the Nebula app offline. And then that way \nthey'll have something to watch. I don't think\nsuch a solution exists. I don't think there's any way that we could watch\nanything on our flight. And certainly not any episode\nof our show that we make. No. No.\nNot a new one. So even if we could\nwatch an old episode  there's no way we could\nwatch a new episode. And even if we could do\neither of those things  there's no way that it\nwould be the finale. No. There's no way to\nwatch it  I don't think.

        "transcript": "Hello  and welcome back\nto the finale of hide-and-seek\nacross Switzerland. Right now  there's one day left  which means Adam has\njust enough time to potentially pull back\nand win the whole thing. If he can beat Ben's\n9 hour and 36 minutes  he'll secure first place\nright before the final day ends. That might be a tall order \nbut Adam has a plan that relies on exactly where\nhe placed his hiding zone  a plan we'll learn more about later. For now  let's return to\nthe woods in Winterthur  where Ben and I are about\nto start our final day. Hello. It's 7:30 am... and we are... so frickin' back! But we gotta go. It's 7:30. We gotta catch Adam. Yeah  let's get\nto the train station. Let's go. So here's the thing. It is extremely inconvenient. I mean  this was my goal to get from this part\nof the city to downtown. It's almost an hour-long walk  but there's a train from\nTöss Station at 7:51. We should be able to\nmake that if we're quick. I just have to\nnot break my leg. Yeah  are you...\nOkay  yeah. I'm so not\nbreaking my leg  Sam. Okay  but you know\nthere's branches sticking out. I don't care.\nNo  Ben. My legs are stronger than that. Good morning! It is the final day. Oh man  I'm nervous. (sighs) I did something kinda\nhigh risk  high reward. Ohh  we'll see if it worked. We need to\nask some questions. So  I think we almost certainly\nwant to do the rhyme thing. Because it seems like that's the\nbest opening strat regardless. It's a very useful question. But I think it might make sense to ask pretty early the\nsame canton question. I agree.\nI think there's a decent chance\nhe's around Zürich. Yeah  and even\nif he's not— Uh-oh. Even if he's not  excluding the Zürich Canton \nwhich is pretty big  would be pretty useful for us. I mean  the direction\nmight be Zürich regardless  but okay  let me at least\nfire off the rhyme. Okay  fire off the rhyme. I think we're\nin a good position. I agree. So  alright  let me\nfigure out the fastest route to Zürich Hauptbahnhof. Alright  well... They have bought\nthe rhymes. This is good. This is part of the plan. Ohh  I hope this works. It is Intern—\nOh  that's you. Awh. Sin  Flock  Zuckerberg. I almost put\nZuckerberg yesterday. I know what\nrhyme calculator he's using. And Skill. That suggests to me that\nhe is in a German area  but... Or...\nMaybe he's trying to trick us. Yeah  it'd be very hard for him\nto get outside of the German area. Not impossible \nbut it'd be very difficult. Should we fire off\nsame canton? Let's do.\nIf he is near Zürich  it's gonna be a huge headache. Gonna be a bloodbath. And I say that as someone\nwho did that strat. (chuckles)\nYeah. We'll see. Okay  so they've asked\nif I'm in the same canton. I'm not. I guess that's a\nsolid question at this point. If they know that I'm\nnot in Zürich at all  then that gets rid of\nthe densest  or one of the densest areas. On the other hand  though  given that I'm not\nin the Zürich Canton... I mean  it means\nI could still be in a whole lot of cantons  so... Oh  it's a no. Adam is not in\nthe Zürich Canton  so that means that he went\na decent ways from here. Yeah  which makes sense  but there are only so many\ndecent ways he could get. He could have gone\ntowards Basel. He could have gone\ntowards Bern. He could have gone\nto Lucerne. Could have gone to Lucerne. Could have gone to St. Gallen. That would be the main curveball. Is there... a way that we\ncan ask a question that will give us\na direction to go? I mean  considering he's\nnot in the Zürich Canton  I don't think Zürich would\nmake a huge difference if we did— if we figured out whether he was\neast or west of us. (sighs) I mean  but\neast or west would really only exclude St. Gallen. Yeah  but that's a—\nThere's plenty over there. And it would make sense \nbecause it's kind of a... It's a bit of a curveball.\nconvoluted corner. Yeah  but everything else is west. There's got to be a better\nquestion we can ask. But we're gonna want to\ndo east–west eventually  right? Yeah  but it's—\nThe thing is that question is useful anytime. It really is.\nYes  but we need direction. We do  but\nI think that there are other ways we can get direction. Okay. Alright  train's here. I'm gonna venture a guess that their leading theory is that\nI'm somewhere outside of Bern. And I am. So they're right  but... I don't think I'm\nthe place outside of Bern where they would think. Still going to Zürich\nbecause it's still a big hub  and it's still probably\nin his direction. Here's a suggestion. So if we do a 50-mile radar  that would include\neverything east of us that he could reasonably get to... but it would exclude Bern ...and all of that area\nto the west that he could get to pretty quickly. Because that's the\nhigh-speed line. Basel would be excluded  barely. And Bern would be excluded. But we'd want to hit it now and not—\nBefore we go to Zürich. Before we go to Zürich. The train leaves now \nso we gotta... Yeah  hit the 50-mile radius. Okay. Alright. A 50-mile radar. I would say that that is\nsomewhat unfortunate. Because I don't think I'm in it. Nope. And that does really\nlimit the possibilities. Ah  shoot  yeah. That was probably\na smart move. Alright  Sam \nwhat do you think? Is it going to be a hit or a miss? We just got it. We just got it?\nWhat is it? Miss. That  okay  well  now I— It's going to look like I'm lying  but my guess\nwas going to be miss. The highest-speed line\nin the country is the one that goes\nZürich  Bern  Geneva. Yeah  and he couldn't have\ngotten as far as Geneva  but he could have gotten\nto Bern. My guess is that\nhe went to Bern. 'Cause it was the furthest— It was the fastest\nhe could get that far. Yep. Do we want to do\nanything in Zürich? Or just head straight to Bern? I mean  if he's\nnot within 50 miles... Probably not  yeah. Okay  let me check what the fastest\ntransfer is going to be. We're alright. Just barely made the train. Let's go this way. It looks like they're\nheaded to Bern  which... I mean  in fairness \nit's pretty obvious that I am somewhere... in the broad vicinity\nof Bern. Now  I knew that\nthey would figure out that I was somewhere\nin the Bern region-ish pretty quickly. So the plan accounts for that. I wasn't just expecting that they would never\nfigure that out. I will say they figured\nit out a little faster and a little more cheaply\nthan I would have liked. Ben  this is so fun. Yes  we are on our way. While we're sideways.\nWe're sideways. It's fun that we're sideways. It's so fun that we're sideways.\nNormally they're not sideways. And that's what fun is. It's when something is\ndifferent than it normally is. Now would be a good time to ask for a photo\nif we wanted to. Yeah  I mean the train station\none could be good. I mean— I feel like we want that\nat some point regardless. That one is a great— It's just a good verification tool  and it'll be useful later  and\nit might tell us something now. Yeah.\nSo... What do you think  fire it off? I think let's just fire it off\nwhile we're on our way. I'm into it. I mean \nwe're racking up coins  but I think we're – at least for a little while –\ngoing to be in an area where we can respond\nto a curse pretty well. Yeah  I'm not too worried yet. Alright  the next part\nof the game is the key part. Just really need them\nto have a bad middle game. (growls hesitantly) Alright  they want a photo\nof the train station. But that is fine. Oh  my legs are so tired. I mean  I think just a picture of... this... would probably work. Shoot. (camera click) Well  I hope that\nthere aren't pictures that show that graffiti. Okay  okay \nwe've got the photo. That could be anywhere. I mean  there's\nthe same graffiti. Yeah  well  I mean \nwe'll be able to spot it. I just don't think we can\nlearn a ton from that  because... I think that could be\nbig city  small. Good job  Adam. (faint ringing) Why is someone\nringing a bell? What's going on? Whoa  it's sheep. Hello. Oh  it's the sheep's bell. The sheep was ringing the bell. Great work! Or goats  maybe? Are you a goat? Ram  potentially? Okay. Welcome... to Bern. Welcome to Bern. Let's... Bern his chances\nof victory to the ground. Ohh! Hey!\nYou like that? Yeah  that's pretty good. Thank you. Yeah  so we're thinking\na 10-mile radius just to see if he's here or in any of the\nsurrounding towns. Because if he's not... the remaining options\nare pretty limited. Sending it. (inhales sharply) Okay  10-mile radar. Not great. So I'm not within\n10 miles of them. But knowing that... means they can rule out\na ton of the complexity. Oh  is this car\ngonna try to— No. I was really hoping that they were gonna go\nfor a 5-mile radar. Because... that would still kind of\nleave in the outskirts of Bern. I think their best next question\nis probably a latitude. So let's hope they don't ask that. Look at... Look at Bern. Does it have a particular\nthing that it's known for? Vibes? Seems like it's kind of\nthe whole country. Yeah  except for Winterthur. Except for Winterthur. Ooh. What? It's a miss.\nIt's a miss. Okay  okay. He still could have come here and then gone somewhere... He could have.\nConnected. But he only would've had\nabout 30 minutes once getting here. We could ask if he is\nnorth or south of us. We could also ask if he's\neast or west of us. Yeah  if he is\nanywhere east of us  that would narrow down\noptions pretty quick because of that radius\nthat we have around Winterthur. So there's very few places that would be east of us and that he theoretically\ncould have gotten to. Well  he also just\ncouldn't have gotten that far west of us. No  so I guess it would\nnarrow down options a good bit. But it is expensive. I think at this point... We're gonna need it. We're gonna need\nsomething big. Okay  east–west? (hesitates) ...Yeah. Ah  shoot. Longitude. So I'm east of them. Ugggh. The possibilities start\nto get really limited thanks to that\n50-mile radar  I think  and the 10-mile. We start to be dealing\nwith a pretty tight region. He's east of us. Okay. There's a stretch\nof towns right here. I think we've sort of got... Like a band. Again  unless we are really... Whiffing it.\nWhiffing it. Yeah. Which we may be. Very possible. I think there's a band\nof towns that he could be in. And it's here. Well  is there something\nthat could confirm that? One thing we could maybe do... is we could drop\na 25-mile radius. Mhm. If the 25 is a no \nthat cuts off pretty much everything\nexcept for... Yeah  except for the stuff\nright outside of Basel. I think at that point  we would just have to\nprobably assume he went to Basel. But I think considering\nthat takes an hour  it makes sense\nto use the coins and use that to...\nto confirm. I don't love it  but... I don't love it either.\nI don't love it either. He's not making this easy for us. I think it's\nprobably the best option. I think we've got to do\na 25-mile radius from here. Because if it's a yes \nthen we've got a donut. Yeah  if it's a yes \nthat's very useful. If it's a no  we have a problem. This is a critical one.\nOhh  Adam! Why are you doing this\nto us  Adam? This is too hard. You picked a place\nthat's too hard. I'm sure he's feeling... great right now. We are not going\nto let you beat us. We are going to find you. So  to me... This seems like a good sign that they are confused. There's a 25-mile radar. I am within 25 miles of them. I think that's a good sign? I'm gonna say I'm cautiously\noptimistic about that. Okay  hello. This is interesting. We've got an answer. And it's the most\ninteresting answer. It's a hit.\nIt's a hit. So that means that he is\nwithin 25 miles of us  but not 10 miles of us. We have a Target logo. Yeah.\nNot sponsored. And in fact—\nWe have a Lyme disease bite. Well  not even. We have half a Lyme disease bite. It's like if a tick bit you  and then half your arm fell off. Oh  like the inside?\nBecause we've also split Like a cross-section\nof your arm. Yeah  no. Because we've split— We've done the longitude as well. Oh  so it's like  okay  so it's like you slice\nyour arm in half. Yeah. And then you\nslice it this way too. The tick has bit you here. So... Theoretically... hopefully... around now is when\nmy plan should start... really working. Right about now  hopefully  they should be making a list of all the places where\nthey think I could be. And hopefully... where I actually am\nis not on it. (chants  knocking rail)\nResearch  research  research. We should be\nable to figure out... down to a few towns \nwhere he is based on this. So let's fire off...\nI agree. Do you want to do—\nWait. Do you want to do a\nresearch montage? Research montage...\nLet's go! Yeah  Moutier's too far. The one that goes\nthrough Biberist  right? He couldn't have gotten\nto Thun or Steffisburg. Anything before Buchli\non that line is fair game. Oberdorf  excluded. That whole line  excluded. And then there's\nall the ones from here. Oof  this is gonna be a\nlong research montage. Yeah. Okay  this is taking some time because I'm being\nso (bleep)-ing methodical. You feel me? I feel you. I think that narrows it down to... honestly  a lot of options\nout of Solothurn. So maybe we\nshould go to Solothurn. Ooh  there's a train\nin five minutes. We should try to grab that. Okay  let's see\nif we can get that. Okay. Okay  so... Here's what I've done. Assuming we haven't messed up  we've narrowed it down to one  two  three...\nfour  five  six  seven... eight  nine  ten  eleven... twelve options. Okay. Twelve train stations\nthat he might be at. Are you also— More train stations. Twelve towns. Well  okay. Twelve towns. Now that the plan\nseems to be working... let's reveal what it is. So last night... I took a train \nbasically as far as I could. The train got in ten minutes\nbefore my hiding period ended. And then the second\nI got off the train  I sprinted into a\ndifferent municipality within the zone... of a different train station. A train station that\nI could not have gotten to ...on trains ...in time last night. So my hope was  and\nseemingly it's working... They have ruled out\nwhere I am because they've looked at it \nand they've been like  \"Well  he couldn't\nhave gotten there.\" And then the train station\nthat I actually did go to  but I'm not in that\nmunicipality anymore... I did not include a word\nthat rhymed with it. So they're going to look\nat the town that my train arrived in. They're going to say \n\"Well  he can't be there. It doesn't rhyme.\" But then they're gonna look\nat the town that I ran to  and they're going to say \n\"Well  he can't be there. He couldn't have gotten there.\" But in fact  it turns out\nthat if you run like a madman and completely destroy your legs... you can get there. So... Cautiously optimistic? We'll see. Alright. We have made it\nto Solothurn. We've narrowed\nit down to 12 options based on routes that\nhe could have taken  places that rhyme  that are outside of the radius\nthat we set to the south. Yeah  let's go up top.\nEt cetera. So  while we were on that ride  I went through and checked. Five of those... are outside of\nfive miles from here. Seven are not. So we can more or less\nsplit our options in half ...if we set a 5-mile radius. This does put him\nover 200 coins. It's a bit risky. As long as we\ndon't get him to... 300  we're fine. ...Yeah. Just  it's fine \ndon't worry about it. Alright  should I send it? Send it. Castle! Alright  they have\nrequested a 5-mile radar. I'll tell them... they missed. Okay. So either we just narrowed—\nThat's getting messy. Yeah  'cause either we've\nnarrowed it down to five... Or... Or he's somewhere else weird. Or we messed up a lot. So  with our options\nnarrowed down to five  we asked Adam whether\nhis next train departed at an odd or even time. He answered odd  which eliminated four\nof the remaining towns  and left us with just one:\nWiedlisbach. So  assuming we didn't\nmake any mistakes  we hopped onto the\nnext train to Wiedlisbach. I'm just really worried that we've whiffed massively and that—\nNo  it's not possible. Well  it is. We're so good at this. He's gonna be in Wiedlisbach. The problem is that\nif we whiffed massively  this will all probably\nbe edited down massively  because it's gonna be\nreally boring. Since this next part\nis really boring  I'll just give you the gist. We took a quick\n15-minute train north before finally arriving\nin Wiedlisbach  only to discover that\nWiedlisbach Station didn't match Adam's photo. No  this doesn't feel like it. Well  that sucks. (sighs)\nWe are... rather confused as to... I'm not surprised that\nwe got something wrong. But I just have no idea what. I mean  we must have\nmissed something. At this point \nwe had no choice but to go back to the\ndrawing board  and this was when we realized\nwe might have been tricked. Looking closer at the map  we saw that one of the towns we had already eliminated\n– Bätterkinden – was actually within walking distance \nor running distance  of another town  Utzenstorf. We had assumed that Adam\ncouldn't be in Utzenstorf because it didn't rhyme with one\nof the words he had provided. But if Adam had situated himself so that his hiding zone\noverlapped with both towns  he could have answered the\nrhyme question in Bätterkinden and then walked to Utzenstorf\nto answer the other questions. That would force us to cross off\nBätterkinden as well  and ultimately create\nthe information profile of a town that didn't exist. If we disregarded the rhyme data  then everything else\nmatched with Utzenstorf. So  with our new theory in place  we got on a train\nback to Solothurn to catch the next train\nto Utzenstorf. If it's not this  we must have\nmessed up somewhere. 'Cause we just have to\nmess up once to accidentally exclude\nsomething that we shouldn't have. And that's where he can be. We've checked our work. This  right now  is the only option we've\nidentified that still works. Yeah. And even this is a tricky one. Yeah. I mean \nhe would do tricky. Yeah  that is true. This really\ndoesn't feel likely. No. It'll be exciting if it is. (chuckles weakly)\nThat is true. Let's see. Alright  well they're\nmoving south from Solothurn. Have they figured it out yet? Maybe. Depends on\nhow far south they go. (sighs) Depends on\nhow far south they go. Here's something\nI just noticed  Ben. What?\nThe photo. Oh  it's got that same\nsort of red thing  doesn't it? So it's definitely an\nadvertisement like that. Maybe down. I don't know  Ben. No  I don't know either. No... Not here. (growls) Well... he's not in Utzenstorf. But I don't know where he is. Folks  the plan is working. What can I say?\nThe plan is working. They've ruled out\nthe place that I'm close to  where my train got in \nbecause it doesn't rhyme. They've ruled out here  because I don't think they\nthink I could have gotten here. They simply did not consider... my incredible speed.\n(wheezes) Ahh  they did not consider\nmy incredible speed. We're not\nmissing a line  right? (sighs) Should we\ngo through it again? Konolfingen Line excluded. This line  this line \nthis line  this line. Could he have\ngotten to Oberburg? I think we looked at that. (yawns) Why the (bleep)\ndid we exclude Bergdorf? 'Cause we don't have Orf. I believe in you. This is not gonna work. Okay  look.\nWe have a new strategy 'cause we cannot seem to\nfigure out what town— I mean  we've just looked at\nevery town a billion times. We cannot figure this out. We must've missed something.\nI don't know. Our new strategy is\nmake Adam do as much (bleep) as we can and hopefully trip up\nand give us information about exactly where he is. I think  yeah \nwe forget about coin counts. Let him curse us\nhowever much he wants  and just wear him down. At least to... for retribution. We are going to throw\neverything that we can at him and... Eventually he'll just— Something might get leaked. Yes.\nAnd we can go get him. I mean  a FaceTime\nwould be fun. And it's only ten coins. Okay  let's FaceTime him\nuntil he shows us a bird. Maybe we'll see something. Hello  Adam. Hey  fellas. Let's find you guys a bird. Let's find you a\nsweet little birdie. I'm looking for birds. We could stay on\nthis call forever. Ooh  I just saw a bird \nbut I don't... I don't think I'm gonna\nshow you that one. ♪ I'm gonna show you a bird ♪ ♪ It's bird time ♪ ♪ It's bird time ♪ I'm gonna mute Adam. Yeah  yeah. Just wait until\nhe shows us that bird. I don't wanna hear Adam. I just wanna see a bird.\nHe's saying a lot of words. I don't know what they mean. Alright  here's our train. We are getting on\nthis train to Bergdorf because... we just need to get out of here. We just want to go somewhere\nmore populous and... Yeah  and this is the\nlast one for half an hour? Yeah. He's still babbling. Adam is still\ntrying to show us a bird. Adam? Hurry up and show us a bird. Oh  oh guys. There might be some\nbird situation happening. You see it? See that bird? I'm gonna hang up on him. Okay  that didn't\nend up being very useful. He managed to get\na shot of just the sky. I think I got him\nfrustrated how much he's got. Well  that's something. I think we need to\nask another question for more spillover info. Yeah  probably a\nphoto one at this point. Yeah. Maybe a photo of five buildings. Photo of five buildings? Yeah  I think that that... has the best chance of\ntelling us something. They are giving me coins. I am getting dangerously\nhigh on my coins. Alright  let's find them\nsome great buildings. I don't think that this is\ngoing to be helpful to them. Okay. Well... We are in Bergdorf \nand we are so very lost. I love Bergdorf. Where you just have\nto keep looking at maps and seeing if we\ngot something wrong. I love looking at maps and\nseeing if we got something wrong. I want to get a snack. Okay. What kind of snack  Sam? I don't know  I haven't\ntried these things yet. I think it's like a\nchocolate chip scone. Me neither. Okay. What about from this angle? With enough of a zoom... I can get to... this. (camera click) I don't think that that's going\nto be very helpful to them. Now we got a photo. Not very useful. Yeah  that's a\nwhole lot of nothing. Alright  what do we\nwant to make Adam do now? Something. What's the\nmost annoying thing that we can make Adam do while we keep checking the maps?\nYes  that's what I wanna know. We could make him\nrun for Strava. Yeah  (bleep) it  make him run. Uuggh! They want me to do\nthe Strava thing. Ugh  okay. Oh my god \nmy legs are so shot. I just... (breathes heavily) Maybe I should just\ntell them where I am. Then they'll stop making me... run around. (groans) Keep looking. Sam  keep looking. I don't know \nI've lost in ten minutes. You have to motivate me  Ben. What's in it for me? The glory of helping me win. Hold on. Langenthal. This is what\nwe might have missed. Where the (bleep)'s that? Langenthal is before... When would he have gone there? Would he have gone through... He would have gone straight\nto Langenthal from Winterthur. ...What?! Okay  let me explain. It turns out we missed\nan entire line. We had crossed out\nthe town of Langenthal because  once again  it didn't rhyme with\nany of Adam's words  and we thought Adam couldn't\nhave gotten far enough to reach any of the towns on the line going south\nfrom Langenthal. But it turns out\nthat if he had taken a different route to Langenthal  going direct from Winterthur\ninstead of through Bern  he might have just barely had time to reach one of those towns  several of which matched\nthe rest of our data. So  once again  we gathered up our stuff \nhopped on a train  and made a beeline\nstraight for Langenthal. Turns out we (bleep)-ed up \nbig surprise. Yeah  so the\n(bleep)up-am-ometer  is... Well  it's going\ndown now  I guess. Hopefully.\nBut it was pretty high. Hopefully  it's going down. I don't know\nwhat direction it's going. Alright  welcome to Langenthal. We are here so that we can\ncheck that very last line ...of towns. I think we\nshould take this one. This is kind of our... We're so fine. We've had a lot of last hopes  but this is our\nlast-last hope. We're doing great. The line from Langenthal. Welcome to the Thunderdome. Otherwise known as the\ntrain from Langenthal to... This is the Thunderdome.\nRohrbach. With just enough time\nto ride the line once  we checked each station\nout the window to see if it matched\nAdam's photo  eliminating them one by one. Finally  we arrived at\nthe last stop  Rohrbach. This isn't looking promising. The last station  Sam. Rohrbach. It's not looking good. I don't think that this\nbuilding is gonna match. Anything? Nuh-uh. Well... They still in Burgdorf? No  it isn't. Oh  guys. Oh  no. No  no  no. Oh  fellas. Well... I think that's it for us  Sam. (whimpers) I think you brought\nsupplies for this? Yeah  yeah.\nNo  we've got... We have emergency\nsupplies for this. A contingency scenario. Contingency scenario. This is... (cans opening) This is a good idea. Cheers. Prost. It's been real  Ben. We have no leads. The real lesson is if you let someone hide\nin an entire country... it can be a little tricky\nto find them. We made it work\na couple of times. Yeah  and then\nwe learned that if you just go to an area\nwith a (bleep) ton of lines  it starts to get really difficult. Yeah. Yeah  it does. (grunts) The sun is starting to set. That's nice. We can watch it together. That'll be nice. That'll be nice. I think it's time that\nwe let Adam know that... I'm sure he's\nready to get out of... wherever he is.\nWherever he is. He's been there a while.\nYeah. He didn't have to wait\nin the forest  though  like me. Look  Adam... This was... a great hiding place \nwherever it was. Oh  there you are. Hello  gentlemen. Adam  where are you? Well  I'm in beautiful\nSteffisburg  of course! Steffisburg? He couldn't have\ngotten to Thun? Or Steffisburg? Where's that? We don't even— I thought you couldn't get\nto Steffisburg. Well  let me\ntell you what happened. Is that last night \nI took a train to Thun  and then I simply ran. That makes sense.\n(bleep) To just over the border\nin Steffisburg  because it's quite close? Just over the border\nof Steffisburg  yeah. I'll see you at\nZürich Flughafen  fellas. Alright  see you at\nZürich Flughafen. Good bye! Good bye. And now  let us\nteleport to Zürich. (zap)\nWoah! Oh my god  we made\nit to the Flughafen. We're back. Hey fellas! It's Adam! Oh my god  he just came here. It's Adam from\nJet Lag: The Game. Adam...\nHello! Adam  how does it feel? How does it feel...\nHow does what feel? You're about to\nget hit by a tram. Oh no! (laughs) Okay  alright. Let's wait... for this guy. Have you heard\nthis story about his... An old pair squatting with\nhis family for 11 years? You know about— What? You know about\nthe German woman who lived in my home\nfor 11 years. I've told you about this. No! He also said that I knew this. Well  Ben just always says the weirdest (bleep)\nthat I've ever heard. Right. Well  it's very fitting. It's like an origin story for him letting Europeans\ntake advantage of him. Woah!\nOh my god! We made it to the Flughafen. It says on the sign. Oh my god  it's Adam! It's Adam Chase\nfrom Jet Lag: The Game. It's Adam from Jet Lag. Hello! It's unbelievable timing. I know!\nWe just got here. Adam  I would like to now\ncongratulate you in-person on being the winner of\nJet Lag season 9 Hide + Seek.\nWooooo! Very good stuff.\nVery good stuff. (continues cackling)\nBen  you wanna get the thing? Well  okay. Now hold on. Now  while you've been\nmaking your way over here  we've actually had a\nlittle bit of time. I'm— Hold on. Didn't we just apparate here? Well  shut up. Plot hole  but it's fine. (wheels squeaking)\nSqueak  squeak  squeak. Oh my gosh! No  no  no  no  no  no. What's that?\nIt's an oven. Shh!\nIt's an oven? You can clearly see\nit's an oven. That's crazy! It's clearly in\nthe shape of an oven. It's an oven. Sam. I think the oven's front\nis this way? That's correct. Do I want to— I just want to\ndouble check framing that we can see the oven.\nYeah? Okay  yeah  we can\ndefinitely see the oven. (door opening)\n(imitates rusty squeaking) Whoa  okay  yep. Now go ahead and pull it out. Ow! It's hot! Yeah  well  it's freshly baked. Ow! Why didn't I wear\nan oven mitt? Now  hold on.\nYeah? I've got to go ahead\nand frost it. So I'm going to take\nmy frosting thing. Yeah  I think I'm\nholding it this way  so you've got to frost\nthe front. Woah!\nOh my god  wow. That looks so good  Ben. Yeah?\nWhat am I looking at? You're looking\nat the first ever edible Jet Lag: The Game\ntrophy. It's on theme because despite the fact that this is\ncoming out months later  it's about to be Christmas. Yeeees! Congratulations  Adam. Go ahead and take a bite.\nHow is it? How does it taste? Oh  he ate the whole thing\njust like that. Oh  oh my  it's all gone. Wow  he was hungry. Oh  we're about to\nget hit by a tram again. We're about to be hit\nby a tram again. Okay  we're back.\nWe didn't get hit by a tram. We paused the video. One of our mics died \nand also there was a tram. But we're back. Anyways  Adam  I heard you had some trouble\nsleeping this season. That is genuinely true.\nYeah  yeah. Did you have any hypotheses on why that might be? And I really want to\nemphasize that I mean this... I slept terribly the whole season. Yeah? Because in fact  I am... jet lagged! (whooping) See you in season... 10? Oh  god! We've been doing this\nfor way too long. Oh  man! Good bye!\nGood bye! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Okay. I did it! Adam did it. The season's over. But guess what? Your relationship\nwith us is not over. Because we just put out \nonly on Nebula  the Jet Lag season 9\ncut-for-time special. It's a full-length video \nit's 21 minutes  that is clips from this season that didn't make it\ninto episodes  but that we thought\nwere fun and silly and that you should get to see and that is available\nright now on Nebula. We also did one for\nlast season that's a lot of fun. And that's not even\nthe only thing that we have exclusive\nto Nebula right now. Tell them  Ben. If you want to stay entertained\nby us during the off-season  you've got The Layover \nour after-show podcast. We're going to keep it running\nthrough the off-season. We do little games \nweird little episodes. We usually don't know\nwhat we're doing  but it's a good time. You can keep watching\nThe Layover during the off-season. What else  Adam? There's so many\ncreators on Nebula who not only put up\ntheir YouTube videos often early and\nad-free and extended  but they also make\na lot of Originals. There are Originals from – and they're going\nto scroll right now – (rapping)\nRealLifeLore  Real Science  Real Engineering  Abigail Thorn  Patrick Willems \nBrody Deschanel  Lindsay Ellis. Also us \nwe've made a bunch. And also... Mustard. And also other ones  but I can't\nalways remember all of them  but you're probably\nseeing some of them now. Polyphonic  I think\nthat's another one. Yeah! They're all my favorite \nbut Adam  surely this streaming service\ncosts $1 million a day because of all of the\ncontent on it. Ben  what if I told you it actually doesn't cost\na million dollars a day? It costs $30 for the whole year! But it only costs $30\nfor the whole year if you use our code nebula.tv/jetlag\nnebula.tv/jetlag nebula.tv/jetlag You have to use that link  and that gets you a discount and then it also tells them\nthat we sent you  and that's important for us. If you do the link \nthen they know we sent you  and then we get a portion\nof your subscription for as long as\nyou stay subscribed  which gives us money\nthat we put into the show to pay for the flights and\nstuff that we do for the show and also all of the\nmotion graphics and all of that. And if you think that price\nis unbelievable  you're just gonna have to\ncheck it out for yourself by clicking on that link. I  for example  don't believe you. I'm gonna have to go\nclick on that link myself to see if you're telling the truth. But if you're telling the truth  I'm going to buy it \n'cause that's a great deal. Thank you for watching."

        "transcript": "We're here in\nUtqiagvik  Alaska  the northernmost city in America. And over the next five days  we're going to be\nusing a combination of planes... trains... and automobiles... to race all the way\nto Key West  Florida  the southernmost town\nin America. But right now  it's 3 pm. There's only one flight\nout of here in just over two hours  and there's only one ticket\nthat can get us on it. So we have got to... go  go  go  go  go!\n(yelps) Oh my god  Michelle!\nThis is for real  this time! Ben  Ben. Okay  okay.\nOkay  we have to— The Flop is gonna happen  so... we have to see\nwhat's on it. The Flop will be a motion graphic\nthat you'll see now. Okay  here's\nhow this game works. Right now  we're in the\nnorthernmost town in America. The first team to get\nto Key West  Florida  the southernmost town in\ncontinental America  wins. But  in order to get there  we need to chain together\nover 4 000 miles of planes  trains  and automobiles all the way across the country. But it's not as simple as just\nbooking a flight to Florida. In this game \nteams will need to pay for their transportation\nwith tickets  which they'll earn by\ncompleting challenges. Every morning \nfour tickets will go into a shared pool called The Flop. Each ticket allows a team to take\na specific form of transportation  like a 300-mile car or\ndirect flight to Anchorage. Either team can earn\none of these tickets by completing the\nchallenge attached. And once a ticket has\nbeen claimed  the other team can't get it. For now  that's all\nyou need to know. Oh  and one last thing: The only way to get\nout of Utqiagvik today is a single flight\nthat leaves in two hours. So let's see who can get on it. So  challenges \nchallenges  challenges. Yeah  yeah  yeah. It looks like  okay \nso there's only one ticket that will get us out of here today  and it is the\nbuild a snowman challenge. Okay  so they're\ngonna be doing that too. Okay.\nOkay. The only one that's gonna get us\nto Anchorage is the snowman  so we gotta do the snowman. I assume that they're\ngonna compete for it. I'm assuming that\nyou're competing for the snowman?\nYeah  we're doing it too. Build a snowman on the beach. Construct a snowman out of\nnatural snow on any beach. If both teams compete in this\nchallenge simultaneously  the winning snowman will be\ndetermined by a Twitter poll conducted 45 minutes after\nsnowman construction begins. Okay  so 45 minute\ncountdown starts— 45 minute\ncountdown starts now. Bye  losers!\n(shrieks) Okay  okay  okay  okay.\nOkay. So  we have to strategize.\nWe gotta talk snowman strategy. And the beach is right here. This is the Arctic Ocean \nby the way. This is literally\nthe Arctic Ocean. Okay  so I'm assuming that they are headed into town\nto get supplies. Wait  wait \nthey're going to the beach. But why are they\ngoing to the beach? I don't know  but—\nWe need supplies! Wait  do we? Okay  do you know the way? Yeah.\nOkay  you studied. It's right then left\nto the grocery store. I did study! Well  we gotta\nbe quick at the store. We don't want to waste time. What are they doing?\nI don't know. Why are they standing there? What do they know\nthat we don't? (bleep bleep) I think they're\nmaking a mistake. There is a grocery store in town  but it's a bit of a walk. How far is the store? Six minute walk thru—\nSix minutes? (bleep) I wonder  do you think\nthey're not doing supplies? Don't worry about them.\nFocus on our strategy. I know  but keep in mind  our strategy is their strategy. Our strategy is opposing theirs. I think what we do is \nwe use the full amount to make the biggest\nsnowman possible. And it'll just dwarf their snowman. We can decorate it with\nstuff that's on the beach. Yeah. (panting heavily) What do you think they're doing? (strained grunts) Okay  that's not gonna move. Okay.\nOkay  we gotta be quick. No  we should see if they\nhave charcoal for the eyes. Fruits? I have an idea. What if it's the Chiquita woman with the banana hat? Yeah? So I think the move  Ben... Let's just start  just... We put together as many\nclumps as possible. Ohh... ohh... ohh. Here  look how\nexpensive that is. Fifteen bucks. Do you think\nwe need to have... alcohol in its hand\nor next to it? No  there's no alcohol here. Oh  right.\nCome on  let's stay focused. There we go.\nCandy! Those are shapes.\nThose are animals. What about these?\nThese are pretty long. That looks like hair  yeah. That does look like hair. How about Serry Chours— Cherry Sours for the smile? Because we're going\ncandy theme. I guess?\nCandy theme  that's it. That's the theme. That's the scene.\nWhat else do we need? Do we need a hat? Carrot nose! Oh  this clump? I got this clump! Oh  (bleep)\nOh  that clump's huge! That's certainly\nthe biggest clump we've ever had on this show. Here's the thing! At a certain point \nit's gonna have to start being in the shape of\na snowman though. That is true  but you know... It's a very open-ended prompt. It's true. What is a man  you know? What does it mean\nto be a man? Who's to say? Lookit.\nOkay  we gotta get back. Are we getting\none of these hats? Hat. ♪ Hi! ♪ The pink one's pretty cute.\nYeah? Thank you so much!\nHave a good afternoon. Oh my god.\nCome on  Sam! We're running. Every minute counts! So I'm thinking one\napproach that could work well is taking those\nbig boulders of snow and kinda whittling them down. Yes. ♪ Clump it up ♪ ♪ Clump it when you're startin'\nwith your head round ♪ Let's try that \nsee if that works well  versus a rolling strategy. Yes  correct. No rolling. Waste of time. It only works in\nCharlie Brown cartoons. Ben  I'm gonna take a clump. Yeah.\nI'm gonna roll it around in the really soft\nsnow up here. 'Cause that's the way you're\nsupposed to build a snowman. Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah. This is...\nIt's not really working. No. Does it look bigger? Uh  maybe. There's the whale arch. Let's make sure not to\nshow them what we bought. Should we pretend\nthe store was closed? We're gonna lie to them? Like psychological\nwarfare  right? Oh  Ben  there they are. There they are? (Sam and Michelle panting) Well  you guys made the\nright call not going to the store. Was it closed? Yeah  they had a power failure.\nYeah. So the store was...\nUh-oh! ...straight-up closed.\nDon't talk to them  Sam! We don't have time to\ntell them what happened! Okay  yeah. There we go. They believed it.\nThey believed it. Power failure. I wonder if they're lying \nand they got stuff  and they don't want\nus to know about it until it's too late. That's like... I mean  come on! How did you get\nthat many big ones? Okay... What the hell is Ben doing? Ah  (bleep) (icicle cracks)\nOh (bleep)  that— That mother-(bleep)\nalmost impaled me. It's kind of like I'm\njust spanking our snowman. He's a bad boy.\nHuh? Our snowman's a bad boy. (hollow thumping)\nWhat are you doing? Okay  that's very promising. Okay  I think we need to\nstart working on outfit and such. When you focus on styling. Okay.\nBut we need a head. Huh? I'm kind of turned on.\nSure feels a woman. Oh  that looks—\nThat looks— Holy (bleep) Okay  it's precarious.\nDon't touch it. Move! Sam  get your ass over here!\nWe're not done! Oh  you brought snacks. Oh my god  Michelle  where\ndid you find the carrots? Oh  the store\nwasn't really closed! No  we found these\non the side of the road. This was Sam's idea!\nI didn't wanna lie to you guys! I feel like he didn't\nget us that bad with that. 'Cause the hole needs\nto be smaller than the carrot. Oh  yes.\nYeah  let's pack it in. Oh (bleep)  the carrot\nactually looks really good. Yeah  it's iconic. Oh (bleep) \nthey bought a hat. Oh my gosh \nthey have gummies. Sour S'ghetti hair  huh? I need you to move\nfaster to ignore them! (mutters) It's not opening! I don't know how to\nput another arm in this thing. I think it's fine. It's incomplete!\nWe have 10 seconds! Now what do we need?\nWe have 10 seconds! Okay  wait  wait  wait! No  no  no  no  no!\nDon't (bleep) risk it! 5  4  3  2  1. Hands off!\n(bleep) Oh no.\nOkay. Alright  I mean \nwe have to really hurry. So  post the poll. Okay  which is\nthe best snowman? Twitter poll. How do you feel?\nHonestly? Theirs is\nreally good  Sam. Pretty impressive\nfor no materials  but I feel like\nwe should get credit for getting materials. I know  but... Ours is pretty\ncute looking  though. Look at her. Damn  look at her. Look at this fine lady. I'm checking her out. Let's pull up Alaska Airlines and get 100% ready to book. Sam is pre-filling out\nour flights. We're honestly filling out\nthe flights as a formality  because I think we lost. Their snowman is so good! I really don't\nwant to get stuck here. I think that... the soonest we would\nget out of here if we lost this would\nbe tomorrow morning. I am still worried about\neven making this flight though. Me too.\nIt's going to be (bleep) tight. It's going to be tight. A snowman\nis determining our fate! Our fate will be determined\nby many stupider things over the next five days. I'm gonna be honest  and I really hope this\ndoesn't bite me in the ass... I feel confident. Okay  Ben  let's\nget our backpacks on to wait for the reveal. Let's get ready to go. Okay  here we go. Poll ending. It says poll ending. 765 votes. Oh my god \nit's loading right— I'm gonna throw up.\nI'm literally gonna throw up. Okay  okay \nwait  wait  wait  okay. Let's gooo!\n(others scream) Go! Go! Go! Wait  I don't have my backpack. Get your backpack  let's go!\nThat was astounding! Bye  boys! Wait  I gotta book the flight.\nBye  Ben and Adam! I gotta book the flight. (whispering) Bye! Bye  Michelle! This is crazy!\nThe biggest win is that we don't have to stand\nout here in this cold doing challenges now. If we don't\nmiss this flight! Come on  book it!\nYes. I'm gonna be honest \nI'm shocked. I'm shocked and appalled. Let's refresh the Flop.\nI'm generating a new one. 800 mile flight.\nDance like nobody's watching. Get 1 000 feet away from the nearest building that\ncould contain people. Once stationed \nboth team members must memorize and\nsuccessfully perform Amy's TikTok dance \nat tempo  with no mistakes. Okay... It's dance like nobody's watching. Okay  that's another ticket\nthat can get us out of here. That ticket would get us out  but we have to get 1 000 feet\nfrom the nearest building. Okay.\nOkay. Let's start walking. Okay.\nMonday  October 23rd. Is that right?\nToday's Monday  yes. And who are you?\nMichelle Asha Khare. And what's your channel? I'm Michelle Khare.\nFollow  like  subscribe  thanks. And what do you do? Oh  I host a show\ncalled Challenge Accepted  which is all about me trying the world's most\nintense professions and lifestyles and communities. And why are you here?\nI'm here... because Sam let me\ndo this for finally. And what's your\nsocial security number? Alright  let's hustle\na little bit. We're not going to\nlet this set us back. No.\nNever bet against the boys. So  I mean  the ticket\nthat's available now could still get us\nto Anchorage tonight. It's just that  as we've mentioned  the flight leaves in\nan hour and a half. And we have to get\n1 000 feet from a building and learn this dance. Wait.\nI'm very excited. What do you mean  wait? Sorry.\nWhat do you mean  wait? Well  the flight\ndidn't go through. I tried to pay for it \nand it didn't go through. Did it book? No.\nWhat do you mean  no?! I don't know  it keeps\ngiving me an error. An error? Okay  so it turns out  the place where\nI think we can do this is like a mile away. We're still gonna try. 'Cause the flight leaves\nin 70 minutes  so... I mean  even if we got there\n20 minutes before it left... we could probably still board. Okay  gonna attempt this again. Please  god. If not  we can probably\nget it at the airport. Nope. No?\nNo. Okay  let's go. Let's get to the airport. Wait  let me try\none more thing. Oh  Sam! We're gonna miss the\nplane that we earned! Are Ben and Adam okay? They'll be fine. So Ben  one real\nactual thing is that we genuinely have to\nwatch out for polar bears. Yeah. There  it's supposedly... peak polar bear season.\nUh-huh. There are (bleep)-loads\nof polar bears here. Uh-huh. And we've seen lots\nof signs being like... \"Don't get eaten.\" So I think all of this is\ntechnically part of a lagoon  so I don't know if\nwe can walk on that. Whoa  the snow's pretty deep. This feels quite... I think we're good. I feel like I'm trying\nto walk in such a way that I don't... sink down. Oop. (dogs barking) Left. Yeah. Okay  we have made it to... the middle  truly \nof nowhere  finally. Oh my god. That's a plane. Oh  is that the plane\nthat they're gonna get on? It has to be  it's the only plane. It's the only plane. Ticket counter. (gasps)\n(phone ringing) The ticket counter's closed. Oh no. It's over here  I think. Oh my god. (exhaustedly) Hi. Hi. (indistinct)\nHuh? We need a ticket. Are there still seats\non this plane? Correct. Yeah  we tried to\ndo it online just earlier. Oh  because it\nwouldn't go through online. Okay  okay. What's the number? So  if we can do this  we have to learn and perform\na TikTok dance out here. And if we can do it fast enough \nwe can get on that plane.

Oh my god  Amy! This is so complicated.\nAnd a one  and a two. Sam is calling  because\nwe can't buy a ticket here. And we have like ten minutes\nto try and book this flight. Oh my god. I'm gonna get out my computer\nand try my computer too. (grunts) Drop your ice cream cone \nsad  sad. I turn and I go \nshoot  doop  doop. I'll be facing forward. And then we turn it\naround like this. Shoo  shoo. Okay  then it's\njust (bleep) kicking. Boop  boop. And then we go  boop \nboop  boop  boop. We are so (bleep)-ed.\nYeah  we're (bleep)-ed. I just nearly had\nfour panic attacks  heart attack  and\nself-implosion in a row. Because it wasn't\nbooking on the phone. We get here \nthey don't book in person. But thankfully \nwe got it on a laptop. And with three minutes\nto spare before it closed. (muttering) What can you do\nto turn it around? Oh  I turned around too early. One  two  three  four. Oh no  that's the Vogue!\nShake it! Ohh. Tss  tss. No  you did it too early. I am gonna go ahead\nand let you know  Ben  that it has just started snowing. And a bop  bop  wiggle your— No  no  no.\nIt's  you have to little pause. It's a bump  and a bump \nand— no  no. One  two  three  four  wait. Yeah  we're for\nsure gonna die out here. We're gonna— We— The plane leaves in 40 minutes. The entirety of the airport. It's so...\nThe airport is this room. Yes.\n(giggles) And there's nothing past security. You just go through security and board the plane  that's it. You know  I genuinely\nstill can't believe that we're getting on this \nbecause I thought Ben and Adam's snowman\nwas so good. It was very good.\nIt was so good. Yeah. What can you do\nto turn it around? Oh wait  (bleep) Two  three  four! Oh wait  (bleep)! I always forgot what to do. Okay  polar bear check. Oh yeah  polar bear check.\nPolar bear check. No polar bears at the moment. That's good. That's positive.\nThat's good. Vogue! No  (bleep)! It wasn't Vogue!\nIt's stop  then Vogue! This is... not going well. (bleep)-ing hell. Ugh. Hi there.\nHey. Your jacket is inside out. Just as an FYI. That is really where I am\nmentally right now. Everything about the\npast hour of my life has made me see\nmaximums today. Yes  anyway. We are officially on the aircraft. (whispering)\nWe're on the plane today. Very little more\ncan go wrong now. Why would\nyou say that  Sam? (sniffles)\nOne  two  three  four! I do  I do  do. What can you do\nto turn it around? Nice! One  two three  four.\nVogue  Vogue. I think that was it! I think that one... I think we got it  baby! We do have to notify them. Okay. So I'm gonna call\nSam and Michelle. Heugh... okay  it's recording. I am duty-bound to\ninform you that we have... danced like nobody is watching. Furthermore  I just\nwould like to mention as a piece of\npersonal information... that I'm extremely\n(bleep)-ing cold. And it started snowing... about ten minutes\ninto us doing the dance. But see you on\nyour flight  losers. We only have to walk\ntwo miles. We are  we're\ngonna get on that flight. The one we're on? You're trying to get on\nthis plane? Yeah. Yeah  it's gonna\nwork out perfectly. Be scared. Be afraid. Okay. Good luck.\nGood luck! Cool. Do you think they're\nactually trying to get here? No.\nNo. No. Here's what I'll say. I can see the plane.\nThere it is. And it has not \nit hasn't left yet. Look  we keep\nwalking towards that plane until it's not there anymore. That's what I say. Bye  Ben and Adam. This is a robust taxi. If I'm fully honest  I actually really miss\nBen and Adam. They're really fun.\nReally? Yeah. They're so fun. Adam  what do you\nthink are in these pipes? Water. Oh. You don't have a\nvery whimsical mind. Oh  sorry  what do\nyou think's in these pipes? Chocolate. So it's... it's kind of a\nNative-designed salmon thing. That's so cool. Ben and Adam\nare gonna cut this. They hate facts about planes. (giggles) Let me get the plane. (loud rumbling) Bye  Ben and Adam! (wind surging) I'm hearing\na noise that I don't like. Oh  (bleep) Well... That is... bad. That is the only plane\nout of here today. Which means... we are here until\ntomorrow morning at least. Wait  get your hand in here. There's someone there. Bye! Smudged. Yee-haw. Hwoop! This is make or break. Find alcohol \nfind alcohol  find alcohol. Now I look like a maniac running across the parking lot\nwith a sandwich in hand  but that's what Jet Lag does to ya! Oh my god  what? No way. Ben and Adam editing this? I'm mad at you! Come on! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus All that and more\nthis season on Jet Lag! It's a super exciting one  and you can see it all\none week early if you're a Nebula subscriber. Just to especially\nentice you right now  I'm putting up two shots\nfrom episode two. Okay  this is me and Michelle. We're reacting to the\nsame thing that happened. It's this big unexpected\nthing that happens. And you could find out\nwhat that thing is and what's making us\nmake these faces... Right now.\nThe episode's up right now on Nebula! So if you're watching this \nwe know that you haven't signed up\nfor Nebula yet. And...\nAnd that's okay. Part of that might be\nbecause  of course  there's a lot of recurring\nmonthly fees that you have to pay. And it's kind of stressful for those all to stack\nand stack and stack. But we have an option for that. It's a limited time deal. To be honest \nit's not the cheapest way to get access to Nebula  but it's a different way\nto get access to Nebula. And it's called Lifetime. Basically  you pay one fee  and you get lifetime\naccess to Nebula. That's it  it's really that simple. And it allows us to\nreally grow the platform. A surprising amount of people\nseem to like having it  which is why we brought it back. This is now the\nthird time that we have it. So  it's available.\nLink in the description. And if you're looking\nfor the perfect holiday present for the Jet Lag nerd in your life  you can now gift\nLifetime Subscriptions. Just go to nebula.tv/gift  you put it in their email \nyou write a little note  and you'll be giving them a\npresent that will last a lifetime. And in addition to getting\nto see next episode early  Nebula is a whole\nstreaming service. It's got tons of\namazing original shows and documentaries\nand podcasts from all your favorite creators. And one of those is our\naftershow podcast  The Layover. Every week after the show  we get together with the\nguest this season  Michelle. And we talk about what happened. We break it down  we do some behind the scenes stuff. Talk about how\nwe designed the game. Talk about how\nwe designed the game. Get into the nitty-gritty\nof the strategy. Lots of fun stuff. So if you're interested\nin diving deeper  The Layover is\na great way to do it. And you can obviously only\nlisten to that on Nebula. I think that that's a very\ngood reason to be on Nebula. But  the thing is  there's more than 100\nother creators on Nebula  and they're all doing\nexceptional stuff. They're making original content. They're releasing stuff early.\nThey're doing exclusive stuff. It's really  you know \ndesigned to be the best home to the stuff\nthat a creator makes. And  you know  that also\nextends to the business model because the creators get a\nportion of your subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed  which is really good  stable  recurring monthly income\nthat we can rely on without the ebbs and flows\nof  you know  ad rates.

        "transcript": "Welcome to episode two of our race from the top of Alaska to the bottom of Florida. In this game  teams must complete\nchallenges to earn tickets which they can use to\npurchase transportation. Last episode \nmy partner Michelle and I managed to earn a ticket onto\ntoday's one and only flight out of America's northernmost city \nUtqiagvik  Alaska  giving us the lead on\nBen and Adam  who are now stuck in\nUtqiagvik with no way out until the next flight\nat 10:30 am tomorrow. Well  that is bad. But all is not\nlost for Ben and Adam. With Michelle and I in the air  they now have\ntwo and a half hours where we can't compete\nwith them for tickets. This is especially bad for us \nbecause today's best ticket  a 1 500 mile flight that could\nbe a team's way to the lower 48  is still hiding somewhere\nin the day's deck. So with the time left\nin the game day  Ben and Adam are hoping to\nforce up that powerful ticket by getting rid of one of the easy\nchallenges in today's Flop: Find a non-American flag. Okay. Oh  one fun fact about\nthis place is that because everything has to be shipped in by a plane and stuff  frozen pizzas are $20. (whispering) $20?! Isn't that crazy? Ben  I've got great news. Michael Angelo's Baked Ziti has a beautiful Italian flag on it. Mamma mia!\nI feel transported! I feel transported to the\ngreat nation of Italy. That's a ticket claimed. It's not a great ticket \nbut it's a ticket. I think the more\ninteresting thing is... if something good can\ncome up in The Flop now. Yeah  okay. So let's go ahead.\nAlright  let's generate. A random number. Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh. 1500 mile flight\nto a coastal state. Have a picnic on the beach. While sitting on a beach  both team members\nmust share and enjoy at least three different foods. So  this is the best ticket that's in today's deck by far. Because here's the thing.\nIf we get this ticket  that means that we'll have not\nonly a flight to Anchorage  but we'll have a flight\nstraight out of Anchorage to... Seattle.\nSeattle. Let's have a lovely little picnic. I'm feeling pretty good. Let's buy a\ndelicious candy treat. We deserve a treat. We can get some Cracker Jill. What the hell kinda\nwoke BS is this? Ooh  Pop Rocks. M&Ms. Three delicious foods. $7.98. Thank you. Having this ticket pop up\nis kind of big for us. Yeah. I think it's gonna—\n'Cause here's the thing. They're gonna get to\nAnchorage by tonight  but they're not\ngonna have a way out. They're not\ngonna have a way out. So you would think\nthat Sam and I have a big lead because we're already on\na plane out of Utqiagvik. But the answer is no. Right now  Ben and Adam  I'm guessing they're doing\nthe picnic on the beach so that they can get down\nto the contiguous 48. So they're definitely\ngonna be able to get to Seattle. Tomorrow.\nTomorrow. We of course have the advantage of being able to get\nto Anchorage tonight. But there's pretty much nothing much we can\ndo once we get there. Maybe one challenge  but we're\npretty much done for the night. We gotta get to Seattle. (rapping)\n♪ Let's go to the beach  beach ♪ ♪ Let's go get away ♪ ♪ They say what they gonna say ♪ ♪ Have a drink  clink \nfound a Bud Light ♪ ♪ Bad (bleep) like me\nis hard to come by ♪ So true. (laughs) We have\narrived in Anchorage. Good night. Alright.\nThank you. Jet Lag.\nThank you. Thank you.\nGood night. Okay  we just got here. Did you learn some news? I did. They were busy while\nwe were in the air. So they have gotten their\nflight to Anchorage tomorrow. They've also won a flight to get to  most likely  Seattle. And they also found a\nnon-US flag  and now they have a car. So it means we've got\nsome work to do in the morning. But the good news is\nwe have a plan. So let's go do that. So here's the plan. Michelle and I need to\nget to the lower 48. Driving would take 41 hours\nand go through Canada. And there aren't any trains  so our only choice is to fly. And if we want to fly\ndirect to Seattle  not stopping in\nJuneau or something  there's only one ticket\nin tomorrow's deck that will get us there: a 1 600 mile flight you can earn by finding a moose\nand telling it a joke. We need to find that ticket\nand complete it fast tomorrow  because there's a\n10 am flight to Seattle we really want to make. You start each day where\nyou ended the last day. So to optimize our chances  we're gonna end our day\nin Earthquake Park  a supposed moose spotting hotspot. We can get there by taking an Uber  even though we don't\nhave a car ticket  because teams are allowed\nto travel locally for free. Hello!\nHello. How are you? Okay  generate a\nnew card in the Flop. 400 mile car. Climb a tree. Climb up a tree to at least\n4 feet off the ground. Okay  the new challenge\nis to climb a tree. I don't think there are\nany trees here  Ben. No  that one's not going\nto be possible for us here. Alright Ben  do you want\nto hear my assessment? Let's hear your\nexpert analysis. We have a full hand. I like our hand pretty well. There's no cards\ncurrently in The Flop that would really be useful to us. Yeah.\nSo I say... we go to a hotel. Yeah  I mean  I think\nwe can just call it. I don't really want to be\nout here when it's pitch black. Hello. (both giggle) We've made it to the park. There's a car that\nwe could do here  the climb a tree one. Correct.\nIt's for a car thing  which is not very useful right now. But we might as well.\nWe have space. Yeah  let's climb a tree. Honestly  right there. It literally looks like\nwe're in a horror movie  Sam. Ready for my skills? I'm so ready\nfor your skills  Sam. ♫ (hard rock music) Woo-hoo! Go  Sam! Woo-hoo! How do you feel up there? It's so much\nbetter than down there. It's crazy. (wheezes)\nIt's breaking. Please get down\nbefore you die! So the reason that\nwe came all the way here was to put our pin\nin this place for a strategic\nposition for tomorrow. Wait  I need help.\nOh my god. It's 7:40. We're gonna call the day here. We'll see you in this exact spot. 8 am tomorrow morning. Good night! We're gonna hop on\na flight to Anchorage. This is our spot for the night. Good night! Now  it's the rest period. In this game  rest periods work the same way they do\nin all of our games: No strategizing  no traveling \nand no challenges. But this time \nwith one exception. If teams can manage\nto book a bedroom on an overnight sleeper train\nwith one of their train cards  they are allowed to make progress\nthrough the night on that train. That's not relevant\nfor tonight  though  so here's all you need to know: Tomorrow at 8 am  the game will restart from\nthese exact locations  and The Flop will be\nwiped and replaced with four new tickets\nfrom the new day's deck. But first  it's time for the teams to go to a hotel and sleep. Or at least  try to. It is 6 in the morning  and I could not sleep\nat all last night. Every five minutes  I was having nightmares\nabout The Flop for today. Because that is how pivotal\ntoday's Flop is for me and Sam. And you know what\nmakes it even worse? Stay with me. Today is the first day\nof Scorpio season. Adam is a Scorpio. If you are a Scorpio\nin Scorpio season  a Leo in Leo season \nwhatever it is  that is when you are\nat your peak. 'Cause here's what I think. Here's what I think. Here's what I think. You know what  actually \nI don't know what I think. Okay  now it's 8 am\nand time to start day 2. (rooster crows) We are so back. (laughs) It's 8 am  it's still dark out  but we are back at\nEarthquake Park. We need to FaceTime Ben and Adam.\nOh my god  I'm s— I am so anxious about this. Good morning. Boo! Good morning. Alright. Were you scared? Yeah  we were really scared.\nWere we scared? Yeah  I'm scared. Alright  I am generating the cards. An 800 mile train. The challenge: Find a real gun. A 600 mile train: Spot a UFO. A 1 600 mile flight that is scheduled\nto land at an even-numbered time. (whispers) Come on \nlet's freaking go  let's go. The challenge is:\nAmuse a moose. And the final ticket\nis a 450 mile flight: Contribute to a waterfall. Okay! Okay.\nOkay! Okay. See you in Key West! They seemed... They seemed pretty pleased. Okay  okay  okay.\nWe need a joke  we need a joke. This is really good. My gut is telling me... let's put a cap on how much time\nwe're looking for the moose. And if we don't find\nthe moose here in that time  we go to the waterfall. I think that's right. I think we want to spend \nrealistically  we can't spend\nmore than 30 minutes looking for the moose.\nRight. And still make\nthat 10 am flight. But we gotta start looking. Yeah  yeah.\nLet's go  let's go. I'm looking for moose jokes. We'll worry\nabout the joke later. I mean  this raises\nthe obvious question. Are there moose in Utqiagvik? If you Google\n'moose in Utqiagvik'  an article from 2020 pops up that a moose was found here  but \"far from its natural habitat.\" I don't like that us finding\na moose would be a news story. If you Google 'Anchorage moose'  then the first article says \"How to find a moose in\nAnchorage in less than an hour.\" Okay  well  that's not great. Here's a map. We're there. So yeah  I think we\nwant to just take this trail in  basically  right? Yeah. Okay  so let's head... walk fast. So  do you think Adam and Ben are\ngonna try and find a gun? Maybe  but I think\nit could be tough there. There are other\nchallenges we could do. We could potentially do the— We could probably do the gun one.\nWe could probably do the UFO one. I personally don't want\nto do either of those because I would worry that it would free up a spot in\nThe Flop for a good ticket. Yeah  since we're probably\ngoing to be flying so much today  we want The Flop to be\nas bad as possible. Yeah  I don't wanna\ndo them any favors. Hopefully it takes them\na long time to find the moose. Look  I know for a fact\nthat there are moose at the zoo  but the zoo\ndoes not open until 10. And so otherwise\nthey're going to have to try and find one in the wild \nwhich is possible  but... Yeah.\nTough. This is tough. I mean  the light\nreally only goes... (whispers) I know.\n20 feet in or so. Do you know\nwhen moose wake up? No. Yeah  I don't know either. What sound do moose make? Do they moo like a cow? Their name would\nimply it  I feel like. Oh  Ben  I got\nsome news for ya. It's really (bleep) cold. Yep. We've still got two hours\nuntil our flight  so... Utqiagvik has a lovely\nIñupiat cultural heritage center. And so I say we walk to that  we see if there are\nany moose on the way. Yeah.\nAnd if not  we just sort of hang out there. I'm gonna go ahead and\ntell you right now  Ben. Not seeing any moose so far. I'm not seeing anything. Me neither. You wanna go back and\nthen go to the left? Yeah  let's go this way  yeah. Okay  this path looks pretty good. I feel like the moose aren't\nout for breakfast yet. ...for all 14 hours of darkness. Does this loop back around? I think eventually. I haven't seen any wildlife. Oh  this is like a trail. I certainly didn't know\nwhere they hang out. Sam  Sam. Something moved up there. Something moved up there. Oh  it's a person.\nGod damn it. Moose check. Moose check. There's no moose. No moose. Polar bear check. No polar bears either. So  good news and bad news. But we did make it to the\nIñupiat Heritage Center. Alright  the woman at the front\nsaid this is the best room. Get ready for the best room. Whaling Gallery. Whoa  this room does rock. This is the best room. Oh  that's beautiful. Dang. Huh. No moose on the coast? None. I think we need\nto turn around  Sam. I know. Alright. It's okay. We've got the zoo as a backup. I feel like this is\nthe size of a big dog. I feel like it's not\nintimidatingly big. I feel like if I saw this \nI'd be like  yeah. You think this is\nthe size of a big dog? I feel like it's the size\nof a really big dog. I think you're\nwrong about that. Yeah.\nIs this our guy? Yeah  I think so. Is it weird for me\nto ask the Uber driver if they have a gun on them? I've never been anywhere like this. We've arrived.\nFirst of all... Gorgeous. Ignore the construction. Crazy! Beautiful!\nGorgeous. I guess we should\nkind of just get to it. Let's fill it. That way \nmaybe we can gain some of that quarter mile\ndistance we have to... So we're going to go\nall the way to the brim? Ready? Yep. Okay  let's stay focused. No distraction. Oh my gosh  Ben. Look  it's a little tiny one. It's a little tiny doll. (whispers)\nOh my gosh  I want a little doll. I want— I would want to\nhave this doll so bad. Honestly  now that we're in it \na quarter mile is a decent bit. Look at that view. (whispering)\nI can't. Guys. Status report \nmy hands are getting cold. Well  good news is it's 9 am. They have not yet informed\nus of any moose spottings. And we are now\nheaded for the airport  because our flight leaves\nin about 90 minutes. So  Sam and Michelle \nwe're coming for ya. Status update  my hands are\ngetting very cold. No! Don't think about it  Sam. 0.24. Let's see if by the time\nI get down there  we get to 0.25. 0.25! Alright.\nThat's it! A quarter mile hike! So this is waterfall-y \nright? Yeah. This is a waterfall. This is a waterfall. Yeah. Look at that.\nOnly lost a tiny bit. Definitely less than 10%.\nThat's like 1%. Killer.\nReady? I have an idea. Yeah? Can we sing\n\"Don't Go Chasing Waterfalls\"? ♪ Don't go chasing waterfalls ♪\n♪ –go chasing waterfalls ♪ ♪ Just stick to the rivers ♪\n(humming) ♪ And the something\nyou're used to ♪ Hell yes. Time to FaceTime\nBen and Adam! What's up?\nHello! Please tell me that\nyou didn't find a moose. Oh  no. But we just showed this\nwaterfall who's boss. Yeah! It's a nice looking waterfall. Well  enjoy that 450 mile flight. Have fun with that. (giggles)\nEnjoy your flight. Bye  guys!\nBye. Bye. Well... We were kind of hoping. I mean  we were hoping\nthat they would be stupid. We were hoping that\nthey were going to waste a lot of time trying\nto find a moose. Yeah.\nAnd not find one. What they did instead... is they're clearly waiting\nfor the zoo to open. (sigh) It's fine  it's fine. I mean  I'm honestly\njust more nervous about what shows up next on The Flop. Can you do The Flop?\nYeah. 600 mile flight to a\nstate that borders the Pacific. Planespot from across the Pacific. Planespot  from the\nend of the runway  four aircraft that cross\nthe Pacific Ocean from Asia  Hawaii  or Australia. It's good?\nEh... Okay  that's a pretty\ngood card  unfortunately. We can't do that here. I mean  the only plane\nwe can spot is the one that we're\nabout to take. (long sigh) Shoot. And they're probably going\nto get that before we land. I don't think that's\nworth optimizing for. 'Cause the only reason\nwe'd want to do that is if we wanted to go\nto California. I think the next\nchallenge we want to do is the zoo at 10. The other idea is we can ...find a gun. Well  where would\nwe even go for the gun? Like Walmart? (dial tone) Thank you\nfor calling Walmart. How can I help you? Hey there \nI was calling to see if you guys have\na firearms section. Yes  we do. Okay  thank you so much. Let's go! Let's go! I'm so excited. (bleep) It's not great. It's not looking good\nfor Team Badam. So we're gonna get\ninto Anchorage at 12:30. There is a flight from\nAnchorage to Seattle at 1:00. Which we could take. Which we have a ticket\nthat lets us get on. But the thing is \nyou aren't allowed to book more than one move in advance. Right. So we would have to book after we got off our plane. Yeah. And we might not be\nable to book that late. Yeah  I mean \nI think our only hope is that our flight gets in early. Let's look at what\nflights they could take. 'Cause I feel like we might be... I feel like maybe I'm\ngetting ahead of myself here. Wait  what was that\nnotification I just got? What notification? (groaning sigh) What?\nMichelle  I have news. Why are you acting like that? Because it\ndoesn't sound good. What if I told you\nit was good? What is it? Ben and Adam's flight – at least their inbound aircraft – is an hour and a half delayed. Oh my god! Skippity doo dah ay! Oh my god  this is crazy! What is your\nimpression of Adam Chase when he found out that\nthe flight was delayed? No. No! Noooo! That's my impression. Yeah  that's pretty accurate.\nHe repeats himself. 'Cause he goes through\nall of the... The stages of grief? He goes through all of\nthem in five seconds. It's crazy. No no no no\nno no no no no no no no no no no\nno no no no no no. No no no no no. This is really\nreally really really really really really really bad. So now we're gonna get\nin probably around 2:00. (snickers) We cannot catch a break\nthis game. We get in at 1:39.\n1:39. (bleep) We would have to try\nto get on the 2:25. That's pretty possible  though. Maybe. We would land\n46 minutes before it leaves. Normally  we can't book... 45 minutes is the cutoff. It's those kind of margins\nthat make the show fun  though. Eh? Right? Hey  for Sam.\nHello! Okay  so here's the thing. Here's the thing.\nWhat's the thing? So  their flight\nseems to get in now  probably around 1:30-ish. But the last flight\nthat they could get out ...is at 2:25. No! To Seattle before... Before the end of the rest—\nBefore the rest period starts. So they might not even make\nit to the lower 48 today. They might just get stuck here. Okay. Isn't it—\nPut on the gas  Sam. Those are fishing rods. These are not. Oh my god! So we have found a firearm. Okay  should we call them? Therefore \nchallenge complete. Let's call them. (dial tone) Why are they calling us? Hey guys. I want to show\nyou something. Oh. It's a gun. You're showing us a gun? Okay. We do have to go  but... Shouldn't you be boarding\nyour flight by now? What a great question.\nYou know what? That tone that you're\ntaking with us makes me think that\nyou know why we're not. Have fun  kids. Bye. Oh  no! Ben and Adam looked so sad. (gasps) Wait  we have to update\nThe Flop. Yes.\nOkay. Well  let's\njust do it right now. I'm gonna get my phone. 400 mile car. Cry. Produce any actual tears \nusing any means necessary. 400 mile car. Cry. Okay  I mean  easy.\nWe could do that. We could  but\ndo we even want that? Well  if we do it  then we get another one\nup on the board. Okay  true. At the zoo \nwe're gonna do it. We're gonna cry at the zoo. Oh  yes. How are you guys? Doing well  thank you.\nHey  for Sam? Yeah.\nHow's it going? (snickers) This is so bad. Egh... We have arrived\nat the Alaska Zoo. Enjoy your visit.\nThank you. Hello  Mr. Yak. Hi  Camel. Hello. We're trying to simultaneously... Cry.\nCry  and find the moose. (giggles) Almost there. Oh my god!\nHe already started? What is going on? I'm not even trying.\nThis is crazy. You're insane  Sam. You're insane. You're so clinical about this. I was like  I'm gonna think\nabout something very  very sad. And Sam is just like \ncomputing a tear over here. Wait  wait  wait. Can you see it? I do see. Oh  Sam! Has it teared yet? No. Oh  god! Oh  look at that.\nHere  let me call Ben and Adam. Another call. Do you see my tears? I was thinking about how\nsad you must feel right now. Sam! Alright  we gotta go  bye! Bye.\nBye. So  as expected  they are\nbarreling through tickets to try to make\nsomething good pop up. Hopefully...\nsomething befalls them. Sam? Wait  wait. Where is the moose? No. Can someone tell me\nwhy we're at a zoo next to the moose exhibit and there's not\na moose in here? I'm gonna say I'm extremely\nconcerned right now. This is not great. Maybe down here? There's a road\nthat goes down here. Here's another moose exhibit. Moose exhibit. No moose. (whispering)\nWhat is going on? Am I going crazy? There it is! There it is!\nThere it is! Do you see it? Hi  moose! Oh my god  finally! Sam  you've\ngot to tell it your joke. So  Mr. Moose... What do you call it when\na moose gets scared? Moosebumps. You guys are\nobsessed with calling us. Yeah  leave us alone. Chill the (bleep) out  maybe. Do you see our friend? Yeah. Yeah  we see him. Alright  we gotta go  bye.\nBye. Bye. (heavy sigh) Let's go!\nDon't have much time. We gotta get to the airport \nget through security quick. There's our plane  Ben. It is here. Alright  well \nlet's go get on it. So  it's 11 am. If we can get on that plane and get out \nin the next 20 minutes  we're probably okay. Have a good one.\nThank you. What is this \nour fourth time here? 11:14. I don't know. I don't know  I'm nervous. Ben and Adam. Yeah  thank you.\nThank you. Let's do it. Okay  well it's good. We got a lot of people\ncoming out now. They're putting away\nthe cones. Okay  that seems good. Maybe that guy's the last guy. No  maybe that guy's\nthe last guy. That guy dropped\nsomething  get it together. Is this where you took us\nfor lunch the other day? Yeah. Wanna eat there again? I don't know if we'll have\ntime for a sit down spot like that. So  Sam. Michelle. I'm a little sad because\nwe've been together for several days now \neven before filming. And there's something I did\nthat you haven't noticed. To my body. Did you get a haircut? No  I didn't get—\nYou did your nails. I did Jet Lag nails! The plane is moving. The flight attendant said that she'd know we were\ngoing to get in at 1:33. 1:33 would be fine. I think we can work with that. Flight's getting in... It's 1:40.\nLate. The flight that\nwe need to get on leaves in 45 minutes. And it's not booked. We have not— We can't book it. We can't book it until\nwe're off this plane. We don't know when\nthe cutoff is. We can't figure it out. Ben's  you've been\ndoing a ton of research. Seems to maybe be\na half an hour. But some things\nhave said 45 minutes. Some things\nhave said 45 minutes. If we can't book this flight \nwe are so (bleep)-ed. I mean  I genuinely am really \nreally  really worried about it. And if you guys\ncould do me a favor  I do have two gentlemen\nthat are trying to make a very  very tight connection for a very special race\nthat they're working on. If you would do me a favor\nand let them hop up before you so they can try and win this race  I would greatly \ngreatly appreciate it. B8. You said B8. This is C8. Hi. Is there any chance\nit's still possible to book a ticket on this flight? Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Are they gonna let\nme and Ben on the plane? That's the question. That was the question that we had. That's probably the\nquestion that you have too. I would love to find out. It's a great question  and you could find out\nthe answer right now because episode 3 is\nout right now on Nebula. So we put every episode up\none week early on Nebula. So you could go... Oh  are you checking\nto see if it's on there? Yeah.\nWell  by gum. Wait  is it? Yeah.  Yes.\nWoah! What? Wait  let me... That's crazy! Wait  do we get on the plane? It's very surprising \nthe answer to that question. Oh my gosh! And I'm really glad that\nI clicked through and found out.\nUh-huh. Listen  we know that\nif you're watching this  you haven't been convinced by\nsigning up to Nebula so far. And one of the reasons\ncould be  you know  there's just too many subscriptions. There's a subscription\nfor everything these days. We know this  you know this \neveryone knows this. So we did— We do have\na special offer for those of you that are just\npeak subscription fatigue. But if you just want\nto pay once and be done and never think about\npaying for Nebula again: It's an offer. We are— We have a Lifetime\nmembership offer right now for a limited time for the holidays. And it's really that simple. One fee  you just pay it  done. Nebula access for life \nJet Lag early access for life  all of the other stuff\non Nebula for life. I mean  there's really not\nmuch more to say than that. It's a Lifetime membership. It's available for a limited time. Yeah It's like instead of renting\nNebula every month or year  you just own Nebula.\nYeah. Well  just not legally  but yes. (guffaws) And that  you know \nit gets you a lifetime of access  not just to Jet Lag  like Sam said  but to  you know... a huge library of content\nfrom other creators. You know  shows \ndocumentaries  podcasts. One is Patrick Willems. The great Patrick Willems\njust put out a... Holiday Special about Star Wars. It's very  very fun  and... No spoilers  but... Three of your favorite\nglobetrotting nerds may make an appearance\nin this special. We are in fact— The set is behind the\niconic Jet Lag void. Oh my god \nthere's another camera. We can cut to the other angle. Oh wow.\nDo you see the set? Hello!\nThere's a little taste of it. That's a lot of fun.\nThat just went up on Nebula. And it's just  again \nit's just a drop in the bucket of other amazing content\nthat you can find on Nebula. No matter how\nyou want to sign up  whether it's the Lifetime membership \nan annual or a monthly  you can do so at\nnebula.tv/jetlag. And when you do \nit'll help support the show. It'll give us a portion\nof your subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed  which helps us  you know \nmake this show bigger  better  cooler. Is that all the words?\nYeah  that's all the words. But anyway  go to that: nebula.tv/jetlag or click\nthe button on screen. And thanks in advance\nfor your support. Good bye!\nHappy holidays! (loud clap)\nAlright. Oh  that was crisp. That was a really good clap.\nThank you. I wish we could put\nthat in the ad read. That would convince\npeople to get it. Okay."

        "transcript": "Hello  and welcome\nto episode three of our race across America. Right now  we're six hours\ninto our second day  and we've just started to\nmake our way out of Alaska. Michelle and I are\ncurrently in the air  on a flight from Anchorage\nall the way to Seattle  Washington. We already earned a 400 mile car\nand a 450 mile flight in Alaska  giving us plenty of options\nout of Seattle when we land. Ben and Adam  however \nonly just landed in Anchorage on their delayed flight\nfrom Utqiagvik. To make matters worse \nthe last flight of the day from Anchorage to any other state\n– that is  this flight to Seattle – leaves in just 34 minutes. And it's too close to departure\nto buy a ticket online. That means that Ben and Adam\nhave no choice but to go to the gate and beg the airline\nto sell them a ticket. Otherwise  they'll be\nstuck in Alaska for the rest of the day. Hi.\nHi. Is there any chance\nit's still possible to book a ticket on this flight? Yes  ma'am. Yeah  it's—\nWhat I'm doing is so stupid  but I'm in a race\nagainst another team. I can't take the 4:00 \nI have to take this one  or else I'm stuck here all day. If there's any way that you\ncould help us out. Of course  yes ma'am. She said she has to finish\nchecking in the flight  and then she'll see. So  we'll see. Okay. Now that we have some time  I think it's time for... the Zodiac Zone. ♫ (gong  slow harp) Because we can't leave\nthings up to chance. We leave them up to the stars. It says that Sam and I can\ncomfort each other in times of anxiety. And then  let's see Adam. Oh  I can't pull up Adam's. That's all we have for today. We'll see what tomorrow holds. Zodiac Zone. ♫ (gong  slow harp) It's under 30 minutes now. So I think the system\nmight not even allow it. No ma'am. Yes  ma'am. The 4:00 flight's\nthe only one that comes up. There's no possible way to get us on this one? No one you could call  or... Sure  yeah. If you can put it on\nstandby for this one  if that would let us get on. That would be great. Yes  of course. Okay. We can get on? We can get on this? Thank you so  so much. We can  we can  we can. Thank you so  so much. I'm sorry  I know what\nwe're doing is really dumb  but we really appreciate it. Thank you so much.\nThank you so much. (cackles) (whispering)\nWe're going to Seattle! We're going to Seattle! (giggles exhaustedly) I really can't\nbelieve that that worked. Thank you so much to Julie  who did not seem amused\nby our bull-(bleep)  but ultimately saved our ass. And now  we're both\ngoing to be in Seattle. So... We'll see you in Seattle. Let's goooo! Hello.\nHello. Welcome to Seattle. We're here. It's raining. I'm terrified. Good news  we're in Seattle. And Ben and Adam are not. Bad news  we expected them\nto miss their connection. Yeah  'cause their\nfirst flight was delayed. And I don't know how\nthey would have made that because we checked\na bajillion times. You cannot book a Delta flight\nwithin 45 minutes  and they landed within\n45 minutes of it. And I guess the reason\nwhy we think that happened is because we have\nheard nothing from them. And they should have had\nplenty of time to do challenges and all the incentive\nto do challenges. Right. So I don't know how\nthey would have done that. This is what I'm telling you. It is Scorpio season \nand Adam is a Scorpio. This is the kind of stuff\nthat happens... I don't know if the\nDelta reservation system... (scoffs)\nlistens to Scorpio season. The good news is  though  that leaves us with some\npretty good challenges to do in the next two hours. I mean  I think the one we want\nis really that random card. Yeah  it's not on the board yet  so we've gotta\ncomplete everything else until it is  pretty much. Okay  so just so we're\nclear  this is our plan: Each day  there's a different deck that new tickets are drawn from. And Michelle  being Michelle  has memorized every single\nticket in every day's deck. On our flight to Seattle \nwe realized that there's only one more powerful\nticket in today's deck: the 600 mile flight\non a random airline  and we'd be able to\nearn it pretty easily because one of the spots on the Random Places\nmap is in Seattle. So  we're going to\ntry to burn through easy challenges on The Flop until that ticket comes up  allowing us to grab it while\nBen and Adam are in the air. First up: Face cookie. Put a cookie on your forehead and get it in your mouth\nwithout using your hands. Okay  cookies secured. Ah  a casual $13. Jesus Christ. Alright  let's find a\nrelatively inconspicuous spot. Okay  do you want\na vanilla sprinkle or a chocolate chip? Well  let's try\ndifferent tactics and see if one works\nbetter than the other. Nope. I think you gotta be gentle. Ohh! Oh my god  there's people walking. I'm on my eye. The nose is what's tough. (laughs) I'm on my eye. Okay  I'm blinking it down. I'm blinking it down. Okay  watch out. You're leaning a lot \nso you gotta be careful here. Not too much. That's pretty good. No  a little bit this way. Yeah  a little bit this way. Yeah. Oh  that's pretty good \nthat's pretty good. The tongue trick. No  more out  more out. More that way.\n(giggles) Ooh  ooh  ooh. That's pretty good \nthat's pretty good. Oh my god.\nThat's— Ooh  ooh  ooh. Oh my god  I just\ntouched it with my tongue. Yeah  towards here. A little bit more \na little bit more  I think. This way.\nOoh  there we go. Let's go!\nThere we go. Okay  let's call them. See if they pick up  I guess. They did not pick up.\nIt's just a procedural step. We don't expect them to\npick up  but this does... It confirms\nthey're on the plane. Which I really don't\nunderstand how they did that. Okay.\nLet's do The Flop. Big money  big money \nbig money  big money  big— Oh  there we go!\n(squeals) 600 mile flight\non a random airline. Go somewhere #random. Go anywhere on our\nlist of #random places. Spend at least 15 minutes\nbeing #random there. Once completed \nrandomly generate a number between 1 and 7 to determine which airline you\ncan fly on with this ticket. Let's gooo! Alright  so off to Archie McPhee.\nWe get to go straight there. Yeah.\nCome on  Sam. Slay. This was the right tactic. Let's go! Yes. Thank you.\nYes. Okay  we have arrived\nat Archie McPhee. So  all we have to do is visit  but I figure we should\nat least buy a thing. Yeah. We should find\nsomething to buy. We could do\na silly random montage. Maybe.\nIn advance. Montages can be\nexpensive  though. Why? A lot of editing time. Oh. You gotta sync it\nup to the music. I think Ben and Adam\nare down for a montage  right? Right  right  right? Montage starts.\nWell  I mean... Okay  this will be Adam.\nThen we need a Ben. This kind of gives Ben vibes. So with all the talk\nof horoscopes this week  I think it's time to\nget a scientific answer on how this week\nis going to go. So let's find out. \"Now seems like a good\ntime to reevaluate who you choose to\nspend your time with\"? This does not bode well.\nMichelle... I think we've been doing\nexcellently as a partner...ship. Right? What? Alright. Solid day. Yeah  good day. We made some ground. Ben and Adam had\nsome Ls  some Ws  but... Major Ws for\nBen and Adam  obviously. I really don't understand how that happened.\nI don't get it! It looks just like Seattle. Feel that? It's like tropical. Relative to our previous situation. Welcome! ...to Seattle. Are you ready? Yeah. You took such a long pause. Let's take a look... at what has happened. Okay  two videos. Here's the first one. Hello!\nHello  gentlemen. We have no idea how\nyou made that flight  but... congrats. (both laugh) Oh  face cookie. Okay  that's fine.\nSo they got a car from that. Hi  Ben and Adam! That looks like... We come to you\nfrom Artie— Artie Mc—Yeah  okay. Archie McPhee's. Okay.\nSo that's the random airline. Yeah  where we just had\n15 random minutes. Okay. Okay  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah.\nI mean... The interesting thing\nabout that flight is it could end up being\nvery  very useful for them  but it could also end up being... Gonna be useless  yeah.\nnot that useful at all. The other thing we need to do is we need to figure out\nwhich airline we get. Oh my god! This is the craziest part of it. Oh my god. How do we do that?\nYeah  so... You need a random number  one through seven. One.\nOne? What's one? American  that's pretty good. It's a big airline. Nicely done. Chaaa! Let's go! Yeah.\nSam! One of the big three.\nThat's what we want. Here's what I really\nthink the situation is. I think the real situation is: we need to be in a good spot\nready for— to do challenges the moment that The Flop\nhappens tomorrow morning. Okay  do you know\nwhere we're going? No. Alright  what now? I think now it's time to strategically position\nourselves for tomorrow. It's just turned 7:00. Yep  it's 7 pm \nwe are at the ride share pickup\nat Seattle–Tacoma. I think it's gonna\nget bloody tomorrow. Day three... the tickets become\nmuch more powerful. If this is the\nend of an episode  maybe it's the middle\nof an episode. If it's the end of an episode  I'm saying next episode's\ngonna be really exciting. If it's the middle of an episode \nI'm gonna say  you know  the next part of this episode\nis gonna be pretty exciting. I think both of those \ngreat points. Good night!\nGood night! Good news. It is 7 pm  and our day is done  which means we can get food. That's the most exciting part.\nYay! Good night!\nSee you tomorrow! Now we're heading into Day 3  and teams are neck and neck  but that could change quickly. The Day 3 deck contains some of the game's\nmost powerful tickets  like this one that lets you\nsteal an opponent's ticket  or the non-stop flight to Denver that teams can earn by\nrunning a drunk mile. That ticket is why we positioned\nourselves outside this Safeway  in case we need to get liquor\nfirst thing in the morning. Securing one of these tickets\ncould mean the difference between pulling way ahead\nor falling far behind. So now  let's fast forward\nto tomorrow morning and see what tickets are available. Hello.\nGood morning. Good morning. Alright  let's do a Flop. Okay.\nAlright. Our first card is... A 600 mile flight\nto a city starting with G  U  Y  F  I  E  or R. If you visit a diner \ndrive-in  or dive. Our second card:\nA 300 mile car for wearing too much denim. An 800 mile train if you\nwrite a word on Strava. An 800 mile flight to\na neighboring state if you are a great neighbor. There's your Flop\nfor this morning. Okay  bye! We miss you  Michelle! Bye! See you later. Gosh dang it! Okay  we've got Guy Fieri. That's a terrible Flop. Yeah. Okay  so obviously... We're gonna wanna\ndo the neighbor one. We need to do\nthe neighbor one. Yup.\nFreaking ASAP. So  Guy Fieri  I don't\nthink we can do at this hour. Do you want me to check? Maybe quickly  but... And then the great neighbor. That  the Goodwills\naren't gonna be open for a few hours.\nCorrect. Is the Goodwill open? My guess is no. And the answer is  in fact  no. That's a great point. Those are all extremely\nhard things to do at 6 am. But that's\nprobably good for us  because it's a bad Flop. So we can make progress while they're stuck here\ndealing with a bad Flop. How about you check Guy Fieri  I'll check the first\nflight to Boise? Are there any\nGuy Fieri locations? No  these are all closed. What about Slim's Last Chance\nChili \"Shake\" and Watering Hole. Chili \"Shake\"  Watering Hole. Voula's Offshore Cafe. It's open. It's open. Voula's Offshore Cafe is open. Oh  should we go? It seems to be\nactually quite far. The problem is  if they're\ngoing for that one too  I think they're closer. But is that worth it? 'Cause that's a pretty\nconditional card. Oh. What are any cities that\nstart with 'Guy Fieri'? Yakima. Eugene  Reno. Could fly to Reno. Does Seattle even\nhave flights to Reno? I bet it does. Okay  I think that actually\nis the better move. Okay  so there's\na 7:35 to Boise  so we would have to go. I don't think we have\ntime to research. We basically need to decide now if we're gonna take that flight. Yeah  yeah  yeah. I'm getting us an Uber\nto Voula's Offshore Cafe  and I just have to hope that\nthey're not also headed there. (growls internally) Right?\n(winces  lolls tongue) We just need to decide. Do it. Let's do it. Airport? Is that what your gut's\ntelling you to do? I think so. Lock it in? Lock it in.\nGreat. Hey  for Sam? Yeah.\nHow's it goin'? Yep.\nYeah. How are you doing  guys? Good  how are you?\nDoing great. Thank you  have a good one. The good news is  if anything\nreally quick comes up  we might be able to do it in here. So we should  you know \nhave a finger on the trigger. Wait  I shouldn't say\nthat in an airport. Well  Ben  I'll go ahead\nand tell ya  I don't see them. Okay  that's a good sign. Good morning.\nGood morning. Hi. Hello  and welcome\nto Voula's Offshore Cafe  where Guy Fieri went in an incredible episode of\nDiners  Drive-Ins  and Dives. The menu has a section of the\nthings that Guy Fieri ate  actually. So this is super convenient. Which one do we want? All of these are\ngonna make us feel awful. Yeah. So I was looking at things. Basically there are\nthree good places we could fly with this card: Reno  Nevada; Idaho Falls  Iowa;\nand Great Falls  Montana. Probably the first two. Probably the first two. Basically  right now \ntwo leading theories. Leading theory one: we fly to Idaho Falls \nstarting with 'I' ...and then drive three hours\nto Salt Lake City then figure it out from there. It's not a bad move. I mean  frankly  if we— Even if we ended the day\nin Salt Lake City  I'd be pretty happy.\nThat wouldn't be that bad. Option two: we fly to Reno  and we get on a train overnight\nthat could shoot us out in Green River  Utah \nso Eastern Utah. Which is a little\nbit the middle of nowhere  and that kind of scares us. Does scare me  I'll tell ya. Tell ya that it scares me. But we're just gonna see. First things first \nlet's eat this pancake. (whispering)\nTop secret talk time. We have made it\nto Seattle Airport. ♪ We have! ♪ It was very quick\nand efficient  actually. No word from them yet. I have to imagine \nbased on that... they're probably trying\nto do the Guy Fieri one? I think so. This diner has been\nfeatured on one show. But now it's about to be featured on a second  even better show. I'm Ben Doyle  and this... Is the Snack Zone  baby!\nIs the Snack Zone. Today on the Snack Zone \nwe're eating a Chinese pancake. Ow. What this is  is it's a pancake\nwith ham in it. I think our deal is  we're going to Boise. We'll get there basically\nat 9 am Seattle time  which is when a lot\nof things open anyway. It'll be 10 am there. Perfect.\nSo more things will be open. Yeah  Goodwills\nand stuff will be open then. Yeah  so we should\nlook into locations. Girl  I got some Goodwills\nin Boise  let me tell you. 'Cause I did my spreadsheet! Ayy! How do you feel with\nthe whiplash of learning that you're going to Boise\nwith an hour's notice? I love it.\nI love every second of this. I'm having the time of my life. It's crazy. It's like if I eat any faster \nI'll throw up. Don't do that. I will get through this pancake. You know what \nfor this last little bite  let's get a little syrup on here. Adam  what's your review? That was a pancake\nwith ham in it  for sure. I feel like I ate\nthe pancake so fast that I didn't even really taste it or know what it tasted like. But  I'm sure it's great. Anyway  let's call them. Hello. Hello  we are at a delicious \nwonderful breakfast cafe where we have just eaten\nwhat Guy Fieri ate. In Seattle  right? Oh yes  and we're in\nbeautiful Seattle  Washington. Okay  bye. Good bye! Okay  well  let's see what's\nnext on The Flop  shall we? Okay. Okay  I'm waiting\nto see what The Flop is. Oh my god  if the\ndrunk mile comes up before we board this flight... Yeah  we need to decide\nin 10 seconds. Our flight is boarding  but depending on what\ncomes up in The Flop  we may not get on this plane. The next card on The Flop is... 400 mile car. Explain the birds and the bees\nto a bird or a bee. The explanation must be\nat least 20 seconds. You must be within\nat least 3 feet of the bird or bee while explaining. It's a 300 mile car. Pretty useless. We can't do that. And it's a car. Great.\nSo  let's go board. That's good.\nThat's good for us. And honestly  that could not\nprobably be a better Flop. 'Cause we don't want— In our situation.\nWe don't want cars. They can't do the\nother one super easily  at least the good stuff. Alright  so now\nlet's take a look. So this is interesting. There are two cars  a train \nand the neighboring state flight  which is a good flight. It's a good flight. I mean  can we just\ntriple-check that there's no... There's nothing like a\nGoodwill or anything? There very well might be. Oh  there's a Goodwill\nthat opens at 8. Ooh  where? The Seattle Outlet Goodwill. And that's back\ntowards the airport anyway. Back towards\nthe airport anyway. 12 minute drive. Easy  okay. We're gonna go to the Goodwill. I think we'll have to wait for\na little bit for it to open  but then we can speed through and do this challenge \nhopefully real quick. Thank you. Bye  thank you! Hi. I'm not sure what\npeople other than us in this situation line up\nearly for the Goodwill  but... Okie dokie  we've\nmade it to the Goodwill. But they told us that we\ncould not film in there or bring our backpacks in there. We've sent Adam in to go rustle around for\nred sweaters and ties. We chose me to stay\nwith the backpacks because obviously I am the\nstrongest and most powerful. Therefore  I can defend the\nbackpacks better than Adam. Okay  we clearly\nstumbled into a world we were not aware existed. No? It was insane in there. It was insane in there? You were like \neverybody got stationed. And there was a countdown until when you were\nallowed to get stuff. And then everybody just\nstarted going nuts. Grabbing things and\nputting them in their cart. I don't know what\nthey were looking for. This  these two sweaters\nand ties  was $2.64. That's awesome.\nOkay  let's put them on. You take the big side \nput it over the little side  and then loop it. No  you've— Nope. I (bleep)-ed it up. Take the big side— I'm just gonna do it. Okay. Oh  these are very petite. Yeah  that one could be mine. This is for a dog. Yeah  yeah. As long as it's on me. Are you ready\nto be a good neighbor? I feel like the\nspitting image of Mr. Rogers. Fred Rogers himself? Yes. Fortunately  Adam \nI have great news. There's a lot of trash around here. Great. Well  this\nwill be really easy. We have to pick up 10 pieces. And we actually should hurry  because if they are\ncompeting for this  I don't want them to get it. We've decided to\nspread disinformation. (giggles) It's all about psychological\nwarfare  right? It is. I think this is gonna be a tactic\nmoving forward  yes. Yep. Here we go. Or  should I give context? Nah  it's fine. Trash. Alright. Now that's one piece\nof trash right there. Oh  there's a cup here. Yep. Two. Seven. This is a bag of dog poop  I think. I don't know what this is. Ten. Look  here we did it. We've done it. Now we have\nto find a trash can. We do have to find a trash can. We should have\nstarted with that. That's compost. Here's garbage. We've done it! Well  now we have to— We have to donate\nthese now  though. Oh  right. To a different Goodwill. Okay. Hi. Thank you! I think we can just put them— Put them in here  okay. Put them right in. Okay  well... We've done it.\nAlright  let's call them. We have received a video. We just landed. Let's see what happened. Ohh  what's up?\nHello  Sam and Michelle! What?\nI don't— I don't know. We've just been\nreally good neighbors. Oh no. And claimed an 800 mile\nflight to a neighboring state. Anyway  enjoy flying to\nwherever stupid place you're flying. Okay  let's look at The Flop. Alright  time for\nThe Flop  Ben. New ticket  new ticket. 600 mile flight\non a small aircraft. Make a giant roadside\nobject look small. Visit one of America's\ngiant roadside objects  according to our map. Take a photo that uses\nforced perspective to make it look little. 600 mile flight\non a small aircraft. Now that is a\npretty  pretty good one. I mean the challenge is a little— Well actually no \nI think that there is a giant roadside object in Seattle. The world's largest\ncowboy hat and boots. I mean... come on.\nI mean... The real question is \nwe've got a couple— We've got a full hand right now. And so if we want to\nearn any more tickets  we've got to use one. Right. So now is kind of the time\nto decide where we're going. Here's their plan. Ben and Adam are going to\nuse their Guy Fieri ticket to take the 12 pm flight\nto Idaho Falls  and drive from there\nto Jackson  Wyoming  where they can take a\nflight in the morning using their neighboring state ticket to get all the way to Denver. Michelle and I  meanwhile  don't have many great\noptions out of Boise. So after we landed  we started burning through\ntickets on The Flop to get something good to pop up. We started by attempting to\nwrite a legible four-letter word by running around on Strava  but I had a bit of\ntrouble writing roll. Pony. No.\nUgh! Anyway  on their way\nto the airport  Ben and Adam decided to stop at the Giant Hat n' Boots\nto quickly snag the flight on a small aircraft. Adam  Adam. I will play cowboy music \nyou know what I mean? Yeah  yeah  yeah. Well  get closer so\nyou can be a cowboy. No  you're too small to\nbe a cowboy right now. I know  I have to\nbe way closer to you. Do a cowboy expression. Is this what cowboys would do? I think so. Say what you're hungry for. Beans. Yeah  yeah!\nNo  that's working. It looks like\nI'm wearing the boots? Yeah. Yee-haw! You're swirling me with force. Well  like a cowboy. That got this ticket to pop up  which would be good in states\nlike California or Texas  but neither team wanted it. Okay.\nOkay. I don't think\nthat's the best card. No  no  no  no  no. So let's see if we can\ncomplete this right now. We are no longer going\nto be going through California  because we're going\nto go through Idaho. And I don't want to go all\nthe way south to Texas. Okay  stick to the plan. That meant we had to keep\ntrying for a better ticket. So we went out into the city\nto try the Strava challenge again  and Michelle set out to\nwrite the word 'acid'. Done. Hopefully Sam gets that\nthat spells 'acid'. I'm ready. Okay  is it looking good? It's good. Oh  that looks pretty clear. Is it acid? It's acid! Yes! Nice job. Challenge complete  graphic. Let's give the boys a call. What do you want? Hello. We have just spelled\nthe word 'acid' on Strava in Boise  Idaho. Let's learn the new Flop. 1 000 mile flight to or from\nan airport above 5 500 feet. Live like you were dyin'. Go skydiving \nrocky mountain climbing  or spend 2.7 seconds on a bull. Indoor skydiving and\nmechanical bulls qualify. Rocky mountain\nclimbing is defined as laterally climbing\n20 consecutive feet while at least two feet\noff the ground on a natural feature anywhere\nin the Rocky Mountains. Okay  new card on The Flop. It's a high-altitude flight.\nOkay  now this one is interesting. I would really like to get it\nto stop them from getting it. Should we go do that?\nThis is really good. Go  call the Uber!\nOkay. This is so exciting!\nOh my god. Okay  so should I\ngo to that climbing area? I think so  right?\nYeah. Rocky Mountain climbing. Here we go! Blackquist Rock Climbing. (grumbles) We're not in\nthe Rocky Mountains. Is Idaho Falls in\nthe Rocky Mountains? I think a lot of Idaho has\nRocky Mountains. This is great. I mean  a 17-minute drive\nto a rock climbing spot. And we're in the\nRocky Mountain region. Oh my god.\nThis is perfect! Hey  for Sam. Yeah.\nHey  how's it going? Where is the nearest\nindoor skydiving place? There is an indoor\nskydiving place in Seattle. Oh  we're really close to it. We're really close to it  Ben. Have a good one.\nThank you. Okay. We've got to be\nreally quick because there's a chance they're trying\nto do this challenge too. Seriously? Well  yeah.\nI mean  that's a good one. The only one they\ncan do is the indoor skydiving. It's not open.\nYeah  but you can do— Oh  it's not open? No  it opens at noon. No  it doesn't open until noon. I looked. I looked for mechanical bulls.\nI don't know. Hey  what about\nBourbon Jacks Honkytonk Grill? Does it have a bull? Oh  yeah. Oh yeah  oh yeah. Bourbon Jacks Honkytonk Grill\nhas a bull. Hi  sorry  we're gonna change the place that we're\ngoing  if that's okay? This is awesome! Yeah. I mean  it's crazy\nthat this is just... It was a 15-minute drive\nfrom a random Albertsons. Oh god! Yeah. Right here. How is this\nnot climbing already? Wait  wait  wait  wait.\nNo  no  no  no  no. It says the mechanical bull\nmight be gone. Oh. Hey there  do you guys\nstill have that mechanical bull? Oh  okay. So there's no way to ride it? Okay  great  thank you. No?\nThat's a no from Bourbon Jacks Honkytonk Bar—\nHonkytonk Grill. And they call themselves\na Honkytonk Bar and Grill. Let me keep looking  though. This is precarious. Yeah? It's not great this way. Yeah  this\nlooks pretty tough. Yeah. We're in the worst gear. Yeah. We don't\nhave shoes or anything. It's looking a little\nbit better over here. Mechanical bull \nmechanical bull. Just don't look too\nfar from the airport  because it's going to make it No  I know  I know  I know.\n...harder to pull off. I know  I know. Ah  it's okay.\nIt's okay  yeah  yeah  yeah. We're doing a stupid thing. Yeah.\nThis looks better  yeah. Yeah  this is looking better. Okay. If we sort of just... went across this  across and up. Ooh! The (bleep)?! Do you want me\nto give that a shot? Yeah.\nOkay. Let's see it  Colorado man. Alright  is this two feet up? Oh  far  far beyond. Okay  I'm going to\nstart going laterally. It's very slippery. I think if we could get it \nwe should. But seemingly we can't. I'm just worried also that the... if the non-stop to Denver shows up while we're in the air. It could. Certainly could. It's a real risk. Okay.\nAlright. Welcome back to Seattle–Tacoma. I think we should get through and go to where there's\nduty-free alcohol. That's pretty good. Sam started here \nand is all the way here. I think that's 20 feet! Let me just go\nover there to be sure. Sam  I think you\nhave lived like you are dying. Let me live like\nI'm dying slightly more. Oh  okay  got it. Okay. Is that good? That is beyond. Let's inform Ben and Adam. Woo! Let's go! Ooh  they're calling us. Tell me they didn't go\nRocky Mountain climbing. Sounds like you\nknow where we are. Did you— Did you go\nRocky Mountain climbing in the Rocky Mountains? We did! Yes  yes  of course you did.\nThis sucks. Of course you did. You ready for a Flop? Yeah. Flop it up. Okay.\nFlop it up. 400 mile car. Fund the military\nindustrial complex. Spend money in any way\nthat you can prove funds the United States\nmilitary industrial complex. This money cannot be spent online. Alright  well... Good bye.\nBye! Disaster averted for now. They  again... They can burn through\nchallenges all they want  but they're still in Boise. I imagine they have some\nvery specific flight they want to be taking. But they've been\nthere for a long time. Hopefully they're just not\nable to accomplish much while we're in the air. Let's look while we're at it about the military\nindustrial complex. Here's the thing.\nThe list that we got of stuff that is\nmilitary industrial complex is massive. Raytheon  we could get\nan air defense system. Uh-huh. John Deere is one. There has to be\na John Deere. Probably.\nA Home Depot. Hey  for Sam. Pro tip  the\nbest airport restaurant that I have yet found is the Beecher's Cheese Shop that is in the\nSeattle–Tacoma Airport. I discovered them\nbecause I started buying their very expensive frozen\nmac and cheese at Whole Foods  and then it turns out it's also\na real place at this airport. I have to take my\nincredible Lactaid pill. Mmm  the delicious taste\nof Lactaid. Okay  we're at Home Depot. Oh  engine oil \nthat's what it was. John Deere Drift Guard\nengine oil. We're gonna buy this \nand then we're gonna FaceTime them. And if they don't respond \nthey're probably on a plane. (gasp)\nHello. Ugh  stop calling us! We're just over here\ntrying to enjoy our mac and cheese\nWe are tired of your bull-(bleep). at the airport \nand you keep calling us. What do you want? We have funded the\nmilitary industrial complex. I guarantee you\nthere were easier ways that you could have done that  but we're not going to\ntell you what they were. New Flop. Big Flop date. 450 mile flight. Become a pumpkin parent. Acquire a full-sized  live pumpkin at least 12 inches in width\nat some point. You must travel with the\npumpkin for the next 6 hours. If you are not in possession\nof the pumpkin after 6 hours  your opponents may steal\nany card from your hand. 450 flight  pumpkin parent. Okay  good bye. (giggles) Well  okay  that's not\nexactly what we need  but we can get it really quickly. We can  but we have\nto carry it for six hours. That's fine  that's fine \nthat's fine. I already see pumpkins. That one looks healthy. And it's not too tall \nwhich is nice. It only has to be 12\nin one direction. Perfect  grab it. Grab it? There we go. How do you feel\nabout our new child  Sam? I love it. They're going to be so mad. We're getting a call. (heavy sigh) What do we do if\nthe Denver one shows up? Do we just leave the airport? I don't know. (laughs) She's beautiful. Thank you. You want to know\nwhat her name is? Ben. Okay  that's creepy\nthat you did that. Well  look at your outfit. That's true. I am looking very pumpkin-esque. Yeah. Another Flop? Another Flop. Non-stop flight to Denver. Do a mile drunk  not high. Run a mile.\nFor each quarter mile  you must drink one-quarter\nof the amount of alcohol that would get a player\nlegally drunk. Uh-oh. (gasps) Bye!\nBye! Go  go  go  go  go. Oh  (bleep bleep) Okay  okay  okay.\nShoot  shoot  shoot. Okay  I think we gotta... We have to try it. We have to! Ugh  I think we're\ngonna miss our flight. This is the ticket\neverybody wants. This is it. I can go to the airport. Find alcohol \nfind alcohol  find alcohol. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus One of the teams is\ngoing to make it to Denver. Who knows who? Except for all the people\non Nebula  of course  because they've already\nwatched episode four. It's out right now on Nebula  just like every single episode is out\none week early on Nebula. So it's worth going\nand watching over there. But there's also a lot of\nother reasons to watch Nebula. One thing you might\nwant to check out on Nebula after you've gone and watched\nthe next episode  of course  is: Lindsay Ellis did this great\noriginal piece on Guy Fieri  the ups and downs of\nGuy Fieri's notoriety. Obviously  we got a little reference\nto Guy Fieri in this episode. And if you want to learn more\nabout Guy Fieri's career  that is perhaps one of\nthe most comprehensive versions of it\nthat I've ever seen. And Lindsay Ellis also only\nposts stuff on Nebula now. So  if you want to\nsee any of her stuff  you gotta go to Nebula. I never knew I wanted to\nknow this much about Guy Fieri. I did  I always knew. No  you did? Okay  well...\nYeah. And there's actually a lot of\nstuff you can only see on Nebula. And there's more\nand more by the day. Nebula is actually releasing its biggest ever slate of Originals. More Originals than they've ever\nput out at this pace before. And it's really great stuff. These are big budget \nunique projects from independent creators. Part of what Nebula\ndoes is  you know  we have all these YouTube creators who make really  really great stuff\non super low budgets. So if you give them a bigger budget  then they make incredible things. We can pop up some of the things\nthat are happening on Nebula now. All of the different Originals\nthat are coming out. They're very exciting \nfrom all kinds of creators. Creators  a lot of them  you probably already watch\ntheir stuff on YouTube. You could watch their\npassion projects on Nebula. They're really good. And  I don't want to\nget ahead of ourselves. It's not going to\ncome out for a while. But we are working on a\nreally big Nebula Original. Big and secret.\nThat's all we can say about it  is that it's big and secret. It's  for sure  is a secret. It might be good. Could be.\nWe'll see. That's a secret. Either way  it's probably \nyou probably want to see it either if it's good or a disaster. But  you know  TLDR  there's bajillion\nreasons to be on Nebula. Bajillion.\nBajillions. And  you know \neven if  you know  the Jet Lag stuff alone\nisn't convincing enough  there's so much good  unique\nstuff coming out all the time. And  you know what? If you use our link \nlittle secret for you  nebula.tv/jetlag \nyou'll get 40% off  which brings that down\nto how much? Well  Sam  it's $30 a year \nwhich is about $2.50 a month. But what about...\nDaily... I mean  you would be looking at 10 cents a day. That's crazy. Less than half a cent an hour! What? I have so many half cents. Where? In his pockets! Oh. You won't show us?\nNo. Okay. Anyway  go to\nnebula.tv/jetlag to sign up  and thanks in advance\nfor your support. Bye!"

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome to\nepisode four of our race from continental America's\nnorthernmost city to its southernmost city. Right now  both teams\nare making their way through the American West. Michelle and I are ahead  having made it all the\nway to Boise  Idaho with a solid hand of tickets\nand plenty of options out. Ben and Adam \non the other hand  are still stuck back in Seattle. They're 20 minutes from\nboarding a flight to Idaho Falls  but that plan might be\nabout to go out the window. Another Flop? Another Flop. While they were\nsitting at the airport  this ticket hit The Flop: A non-stop flight\nall the way to Denver. Whichever team secures this ticket will lock in a guaranteed lead. So it's all going to come down to who can run a drunk mile\nthe fastest. (gasps) Bye!\nBye! (bleep bleep) Okay  okay  okay.\nShoot  shoot  shoot  shoot. Okay  I think we gotta— We have to try it. We have to! Ugh. I think we're\ngonna miss our flight. How fast can you run a mile? I don't know  six minutes? Go  go  go  go  go. I'll follow you. I can do it in the airport.\nI can do it in the airport. Find alcohol \nfind alcohol  find alcohol. Okay. Oh my god  I'm insane. There's bars and stuff. Yeah  yeah  there's a wine bar. Hey there  can I get four\nshots of gin  please? Can't you give me four shots? I'm twenty... six. Whoa  hang on \nhang on  hang on. We gotta get your ID. Yes  of course. What's the\nmost you can give me? Okay  great. So this is two  this is two.\nSo I'll do half. We appreciate it. Of course. Alright  good luck  Adam! I can explain what we're doing. You rolling?\nI'm good to do it. You wanna do it? Yeah  I'll do it. Okay  you're\nsure you wanna do it? I'm ready to go  if you need... No  I got it.\nOkay... Go. I'm going! You know  it was probably\nnot the most awesome move ever ...to eat so much\nmacaroni and cheese ...right before this. Pretty intense flavor. Take that second\nhalf of this one. Here she comes. How you doing?\nHow you holding up? Alright.\nI'm good. Keep it going  keep it going. He's got to run a mile. Think of the Mile High City. Well done. (bleep) this. Uggh! (belch) She did that split\nin like 1:45. So that's a six-minute mile\nthat she's running. That's crazy. My tummy is just ...macaroni and cheese\nand gin. The perfect running fuel. There she is. This is— Uh-oh! Don't break your ankle!\nOh god dammit! Now a little more? (spits) There we go. (lolls tongue retchingly) How is this compared to\nrunning in the Death Valley? (spit) So much worse! Insane. Go for it. (bleep) (retching belches) Ough. Ough. Okay. Don't throw up in the airport. Excuse me. Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben. Here  I'm coming to you. Do you want this? Okay. There we go.\nThere we go. Let's go. (screams) I'm gonna be honest \nmy tummy feels so bad. I need to really  for sure... not throw up in the airport. (laughs) No  I'm good. Well  after that  yeah. Okay  oh. He's coming back.\nHe's coming back. Let's go! Come to meet me  maybe! Come here! Come to you?\nCloser! I'm calling them. Getting prepared. (retches) Okay  come on. (retches) You nearly got it. You ready for it? Hello? Challenge completed. Guys  I've got\nsome really bad news. We already did it. You did not pick up the phone. We tried to call \nyou didn't answer. Okay. That's a mile. That's a mile. Call  call  call. Call  call  call.\nCall  call? Okay  okay \nwe're making the call. There's no response.\nThat's us. That's us  Ben. (sigh) That's us. What? (giggles) Where are you? We're in beautiful\nSeattle–Tacoma Airport. Turns out you can run in airports. Who knew? Okay  bye. Good bye. I'm very sorry  Michelle. That sucks. That's brutal. Ugh  okay. (sobs) I'm sorry.\nI'm actually gonna cry. Okay  I'm pretty\ndrunk right now. Yeah  yeah. It's hitting me a little bit too. Okay  it's a—\n(cackles) Michelle just\nsent us a picture and says  \"I'm (bleep) crying.\" Yeah  well  when you\ngo up against the boys  you are bound to (bleep) cry.\nWhen you go up against the boys  you get absolutely (bleep)-ed. So I would say we're\nsquarely winning now. Yep. And everything's going pretty much perfect \nI would say. (bleep)-ing how? They were\nright next to a bar. Let's regroup. Let's figure out the game plan. Okay  so we have... That's so disappointing.\nI'm actually— I'm (bleep)-ing... We do now have the\n450 mile from the pumpkin. Right? We could go to Salt Lake City. Yay! Wait  there's a flight\nto Seattle in 50 minutes. You wanna go to Seattle?! Sorry  to Salt Lake City. Can we make that? Would we wanna make that? (coughs)\nShould we take that? If we can book it? I think we should  right? Are you gonna give me\nany useful intel? My intel is... It's Scorpio season.\nAdam's a Scorpio. And that's what got him\nthrough the mile. How did they seem so\ncoherent when we called? I think it was Ben or\nsomething  I don't know. (half-spoken to distant music)\n♪ Elbow somebody to lean on ♪ Swallow your pride. If I have faith. You need to borrow. I'm feeling so awesome. I need to book it now  so... Just do it.\nI think so. I mean  we can probably make that. The only thing is \nit's in 50 minutes. If we miss that... our flight is gone. Then let's gooo! Yeah  so can you... Can you help me get\nthis stuff together? Ohohoho my god! I'm so mad at Ben and Adam. Ben and Adam editing this. I'm mad at you! Come on! Oh  by the way \nI've booked our flight  which means that ticket\nis out of our hand. We now have a free slot\nin our hand. There's an overnight\ntrain to Denver at like 7. But we don't have any train tickets. Worst case scenario \nwe don't get a train. But we still make it\nto Denver tonight  and they don't get that card which is still phenomenal. The flight that popped\nup in The Flop is... ...pretty good.\nWhat is it? The 600 mile flight\nto/from an obscure airport. Oh yeah  that is pretty good.\nThat is a pretty good one. You have to go\nto an obscure museum. We can't do that right now. No. (jazz beatboxing)\nBut it's gonna be good for them. What are you doing? Yeah  I need a laptop\nand shoes off. Very bad news. I put her date of birth in wrong.\nWe have to go to the desk  but we have so little time\nuntil our flight closes. Yes. Yeah it has. Here we are. You earned it  buddy. I'm gonna be honest \nI feel like... The last time that I had\nto get drunk on camera  I really... kind of held it together. Yeah.\nAnd this time  I feel like... I'll let loose  baby. Yeah  it's time for Drunk Adam. Adam  do a jig. Thank you. Okay  it's definitely right now. Boarding closes in five minutes. We'll be great. You're doing great. B-20. Looks like it might be fine. You ready  are you okay to run? Luck  luck. Look  look. I know that everybody\nwanted Ben to get drunk. But that's not how it went  okay? That's not how it went. I got drunk instead. And that is... is okay. I'm gonna call Maeve. What are you doing? Maeve's here! Oh my god  Maeve's here? Shout out to Maeve. I'm... I'm recording\non the camera. You are... the most beautiful\nwoman in the world. Almost there. This is... going down to the wire. Wait  where are we on? Hey. Here you go  guys.\nThank you. Thanks you too. We made it. Time to take a nap in this. Hey.\nHi  how are you? I miss yooouuu! (smooches profusely) I'm gonna normal up for the flight. We're gonna put\na bag over his head. Bye  Maeve. I'm calling my mom. Welcome aboard  and\nthank you for choosing Delta. The health and safety of\nour customers and crew is our number one priority  and the shared responsibility\nof everyone on board. Yes  we are.\nWe're in it to win it. Yes  indeed. Love you  mama! How long is this flight? Shut up. Nobody knows. Can you send me my ticket? I'm giving you a lot of tasks here. Alright  off to Denver. Didn't think we'd be\ngoing there today  but... Let's goooo! This plane does seem\nlike it's taking off late  which is unfortunate. It is unfortunate \nbut you know what? We're still...\nmore ahead of schedule than we thought we'd be. We're in Salt Lake City! Okay  so here's the deal. Yes  here's the deal.\nHere's the route that I think I've identified. I think I've found\na route that can get us all the way to New Orleans by the end of tomorrow. Assuming no steals. That would be the only thing\nthat makes it break down. We need to get this steal. So  by the way \nwe just mentioned steals. That's a new kind of ticket\nin today's deck that allows you to steal\na ticket from the other team. They're pretty rare  but a steal coming up\nat the wrong time could throw a wrench\nin anyone's plans. We have to get this steal. First one that's\nopen today  I think. That's an easy one. But...\nI... What the wrap entails... Do you want me to film you? No  it's fine.\nOkay. So we're going to Petco\nright now. I just realized something. No  what did you realize  Sam? Is this good or bad? Let's go back to the gate. Here  here  here. Was it in the overhead? Yes. Oh no.\nI wasn't thinking about it. What happens\nif we don't get it? Okay  well this flight\nwas supposed to leave at 1:06. It's now 1:30 and we have not even\nmoved from the gate  so... We might be losing some\ntime getting into Denver. We were hoping to get\na train out of Denver tonight. And now it's looking more and more like that might not be possible. We'll see. Alright—\nWeird question. Is that the pumpkin\nIs that your pumpkin? Is that what you left?\nthat they brought out? Yes. Those aren't ours  no. That's someone else.\nOkay  there's that. I know it's crazy  thank you. Oh  they took it off. Oh my god  I was panicked  okay. That was so lucky \ndude  oh my god. Okay  so let me\ngo back to explain. We go to Petco. We explain some birds \nthe birds and the bees. We get the right to a\n400 mile rental car. Slay. We use that rental car\nto drive overnight – you know  stopping\novernight  obviously – to Montrose  Colorado. Are we going\nto go Colorado to Dallas? Yes. Yes!\nFrom there  we can get one really long flight tomorrow  kind of around noon to Dallas. And we'll have a\nperfectly timed connection to get to  I think  New Orleans. New Orleans.\nYeah  the risk is if they steal one of these cards... I am going... I am gonna—\n'Cause we're gonna be— I'm gonna freaking call\nBen's mom because she follows me on Twitter. If Ben and Adam try to\nsteal one of our cars  I am calling their\nparents personally. You hear this guys when\nyou're editing this? Do you need a snack? Always. Well you have— But we need to\nget in this Uber first. I'll get a snack at Petco. They have snacks. Not for humans. For Sam?\nFor Sam  yeah  hi. We've been sitting\non the runway for an hour. And they just did an\nannouncement to tell us that they forgot to put\nall the bags on the plane. So they have to do that\nbefore we take off. So... It's fine. We're at Petco. Yay. Let's find birds. Alright  this is awesome. Wanna get this parrot or\nwhatever ready for adulthood? So... As your legal parent \nI have to explain to you that you didn't come\nfrom a stork  even though that's another bird. You actually came from... I don't know how birds\nhave sex. How do birds have sex? I'm not sure. Well  humans  let me tell ya. There's a thing called\na 'penito'. I'm saying that because (bleep) will probably\nget blurred. Bleeped. Bleeped... in Jet Lag. 'Cause Jet Lag's PG. And it goes into a vahuna. And then... (bleep) And it fertilizes the egg and then you have a zygote. And that's pretty much\nwhat happens. So... It's crazy out here. You have to have\ntwo bodies fully connect to make a baby. And it's... It's kinda nasty. Yeah. Well  good news. That was 20 seconds. Good bye  my guy. Bye  and I'm sorry. But that's where you came from. Alright  great job. Well  that was easy. Let's call Ben and Adam. And I'm gonna tell 'em\nhow I really feel. Which is not good. Hello. We got the birds and the bees. Michelle's doing awesome. And... She just did an awesome trick. That was an awesome\ntrick that she did. Adam  I'm mad at you! Wait  wait  I didn't\nhear anything you said. I heard it  I got you. Oh  oh  and I forgot\nto mention. We're in Salt Lake City! Salt Lake City. Okay. Bye! Okay. Alright  you ready for a Flop? Flop me  baby! Flop it! Steal Jimmy Johns' crown. Order Jimmy Johns to a location. Before the Jimmy Johns arrives  you must make a sandwich and have one team member\ndeliver it to the Jimmy Johns. It's the steal. Let's go! Wait  Michelle \nMichelle  Michelle. Concentrate  concentrate. Okay  we need to find a\ngood Jimmy Johns nearby. Well (bleep) It is the game's\nvery first steal. Which is a problem because ...hopefully this flight\nis about to take off  but we're going to be\nin the air. We're not going to\nbe able to get it. They're for sure gonna\nbe able to get that. And then they'll be able\nto steal one of our cards  or they'll just hang on to it and steal an even better\ncard down the line. But either way \nthat is not great for us. There's no way\nthey can get to a Jimmy Johns because they're on a plane! But no  their plane just landed. Landed?! Seemingly. Either that or\nthey're boarding. Either way  we gotta hurry. Okay  here's the thing.\nWe need to— I'm going to book that rental car because we need to open up\na slot for the Jimmy Johns. Book it  baby. You want me to research Jimmy Johns? I can do that drunk. One second  I'm doing it.\nNope  nope  I got it. Oh  there's one. There's one right here.\nThere's one right here. Let's go! Okay.\nCome on. Let's find a grocery store. I'm coming for you  Adam. You see me? I'm coming for you  baby! I'm coming for you! For clarity  apparently\nour staffing here handles other airlines besides Frontier. They're a contractor. They handle Air Canada \nus  the other airlines... (bleep) We have to win this. I know  we really do. There's a Costco.\nIt's a five minute walk. There's the Jimmy Johns. Okay. Let's just get there. I'm downloading the\nJimmy Johns app. Okay. The only problem with Costco is that the food is\nall the way at the back. You've got this. Wait until I'm ready to go. Okay  I got my Costco card. Okay  I'm going. Go! As I was saying \nthe whole moral of this is: Just don't have alcohol. Just don't do it. Don't try it. Just... be good kids. I know a lot of\nyou guys watch–(hic) are high schoolers. Stay in school. Get into Yale like Adam did. Just kidding. We like Adam. But Adam's a Scorpio and Adam is\n(bleep)-ing this up for me. Can we talk about how\nI literally predicted Scorpio season\nwas gonna be crazy? Adam's a Scorpio \nhe doesn't even realize it until he's literally editing this. (whispering)\nI'm normal  I'm normal. But I send well wishes to the boys. I wonder if they're\ngetting off or on a flight. Please be getting on a flight. Please. Please be stuck on\na plane right now. Please. We have been on the runway for about an hour and a half now. Hopefully Michelle's\njust so drunk that they can't really\nget anything done. That's kind of what we're\nbanking on at this point  is that... she's just fully incapacitated. I wanna go to bed. But I won't because I'm a fierce  fierce\nJet Lag competitor. Come on  Sam. Alright  come on  Sam. Please. Hi.\nHi. Thank you.\nThank you. Go  go  go  go  go! I know  but I need to make it. Okay. Oh my god  rip that thing apart. I've got cheese and meat. That's the sandwich. I'm gonna go. Go  go \ngo  go  go  go  go. You have directions? Wait  which way was it? This way.\nTo the right  yeah. And then left! Left out of the parking lot  Sam! Go! Ooh  bread. Now I can have\nthe leftover bread. They just started\nloading the bags on. They are getting\nthose bags on board. And once it's all accomplished  I'll get back to you\nwith another update on our arrival time\nthere in Denver. Thanks. Thank you for your patience. Got it. I see the Jimmy Johns car. Frickin... ...got it. As far as I know \nMichelle didn't call me. Alright  back over there \nI guess. You know  I look like a maniac running across the parking lot\nwith a sandwich in hand  but that's what Jet Lag does to ya! Hello  Sam. Hello! Hi  Michelle. We've officially beaten\nJimmy Johns at their own game. How does this work? When you use it  then\nwe will tell you our hand. Okay  well  see ya. Miss you guys! Good bye. Ladies and gentlemen  please make sure\nyou take your seats. Make sure you check your\nboarding passes one more time. I know we all\nare going to Denver. Yo  Sam  we are\nback in the game. Here's what's interesting.\nWhat? I thought that they\nwere getting off of a flight. We know they're on the ground 'cause they're not\nallowed to pick up a call when they're in the air. I thought that they\nwere getting off. They're getting on! We are so still in this game. Oh  we got a Flop. We got a Flop. 400 mile car. Bribe the chief of police. Visit any local police station\nand leave a dollar outside with a note outlining your demands. 400 mile car.\nBribe the chief of police. Okay. Anyway  we should get\nto our rental car. Are we still doing that plan? Yeah  we locked in.\nWe booked. I mean  we have it.\nAlright. I mean  theoretically  we could steal and\nfly out of here  but I just don't\nhave a plan for that. No.\nLet me  let me— We need to save it. For the last day? Probably. That's crazy. We could probably steal\nand go to Colorado. But we're already\ngoing there right now. Yes  but much slower. What car did they use? They just used one  and that means\nthey have two other ones that almost guarantee would\nget us to Colorado  to Denver. Let me check if there's a\nDenver flight that we could make. I just feel weird\nusing the steal so early. I know  I know. The main cabin door\nhas been closed. All passengers need to be seated\nwith their seatbelt fastened and all carry on items \nincluding laptops  must be stowed. All cell phones and\nother portable devices need to be for airplane mode. Flight [indistinct]\npreparing for departure. There is a flight\nwe could make to Denver. Right now?\nAt 5:30. So we would actually\nhave time to make it. This is insane. What is your gut telling you  Sam? I think yes.\nI like the plan that we had  but this gets us to where we\nwanted to end today anyway. Because then\nwe're even with them. Pretty much  yeah. Because they're\nabout to take off. And we would have\none more flight card than them. And there's nothing left\nthey could take from us? Not really  no. Do it  Sam. Live free  die trying. I don't know what that means. What could you\nhave possibly done? We would like—\nWe would like to steal a car. Okay. We have a... an 800 mile flight\nto a neighboring state and a 600 mile flight\non a small aircraft. Okay  we'll take\nneighboring state. Yeah  yeah. Good bye. Miss you! ...evacuate through a window bank then while on the aircraft \nwait for a water evacuation. They are located in marked\noverhead bins in the mid-cabin. For everyone's safety and comfort  federal regulations require\nall customers to comply with posted flags and lighted signs\nthroughout the cabin  Well... as well as crew member instructions. That's not good. That's awesome. Let me go ahead and\nbook that  right? Yeah  book it! I am so glad we're doing this\ninstead of a rental car. This is perfect. We have burned\nall the challenges. We're locked in.\nWait. All we gotta do is get to Denver. Wait. What do you mean wait? Sam  do you need my computer? No. No?\nOh my god. Oh my god  what?! The flight is sold out. Google Flights sold it\nas available. Why did we do this? There's a Southwest\nflight going to Denver  but it lands at 7:05.\nI know. There's a bajillion flights that are just a\ncouple minutes too late. What's annoying is there's... there's a flight directly\nto Colorado Springs. It's probably where\nwe want to go next  but it arrives past our rest period. (bleep) (grumbles) Aaah  I'm so mad! We're gonna figure this out  Sam. Stick with me. What else is neighboring to Utah? Arizona  but there's\nno good flight to Phoenix. I mean  those are really\nthe only two states that would be useful for us. (bleep)\nMaybe Albuquerque  no. Oh my god  (bleep) Okay  so the decision is  do we take that\nrental car to Montrose  but then kind of in\nthe middle of nowhere for The Flop tomorrow? Or do we stay here  see if we can beg\nour way onto that flight  but then probably just\nwaste the next three hours? If everything goes to plan  I think the route to Montrose\nmight be marginally better. But  I'm really worried\nabout steals and putting ourselves in\nthe middle of nowhere. Yep. Exactly. Okay  if we're trying to get\non that Denver flight by standby  we gotta go now. Let's come. Just route us to the airport.\nLet's go. Yeah  I think I agree. Still sold out. (bleep) (growls) Hey  for Sam  hi. Has this been one of\nthe most dramatic days of my life? Which airline? Delta please.\nDelta. Alright. We're here at the airport. It's going in and out\nfrom showing available  so let's get to a desk. Hey.\nHow are you guys doing? Good. We were trying to\nbook last minute seats on the flight to Denver at 5:30. It was showing two seats \nand it was not  and it was showing it again. Is there any way you can help\nto see if we can get on that? Or is there a standby\noption or something? Yes.\nYeah  mhm. What do you\nthink the likelihood is if we were to wait here and see if someone doesn't check in? Low? Okay  no worries. Thanks for checking.\nAlright  thank you. Well  that answers that. I guess we go to the rental car? I guess so. The rental car\noption is still decent. So I wouldn't— Let's get on the road then. We still got the pumpkin. So how long\nis this total drive? Five hours?\nFive and a half hours. We should be able to\nmake a little bit today. We'll see. Let's get rockin'. Honestly  I like being behind. This is where I'm comfortable. This is— Sam  that's\nwhy you haven't won as many seasons of Jet Lag! This is—\nWhat's going on?! This is my home in Jet Lag. Sometimes it doesn't work out. Most of the time \nit doesn't work out. Jesus (bleep) Christ. Sometimes it might work out. ♪ Adam Chase ♪ Welcome to Denver  Colorado. Yeah. I thought I was going to\nbe feeling a lot better when we landed in Denver\nthan I am. I did too. Well  I actually\nslept the whole flight. And when you wake up in the\nmiddle of playing Jet Lag  it's very jarring. It's like someone's\npointing a gun at you. But in a fun way. We were supposed to have\nabout two and a half hours. And we could have\nprobably forced up a train and gotten it and gotten on the\novernight train from Denver. We would have gotten\noff in Creston  Iowa. That would have been cool. It would have been very cool. I really want to take\nan overnight train. But we don't even have time to\nget to the train station now  even if we did have a card. No  we only have\nabout a half an hour. Let's just go position ourselves\noutside of security then. Where are we? Oh  we're already halfway there. Yeah  we're going to a spot where we have a great card for it. The only risk is if they\nsteal it  of course. So we gotta be super careful – when and if they call us – that they don't know where we are. The plan is more or less\nout of our hands now. We have accepted that there is a good degree of risk\nthat we are taking on  but we think it's the best plan in the circumstances we are in. Adam and Ben\nare intelligent pickles. They might think that we have\ngotten a flight to Denver. That's true \nbecause they'll notice the lack of noise basically. Yeah. And they'll notice that there was a Denver flight\non the schedule. They won't know that\nwe couldn't have gotten on it. So that's pretty good \nbecause they're gonna be— That's actually a\nreally good point  yeah. They're gonna be... They're not gonna be thinking\nthat we're doing this  I think. (sigh)\nI wonder where they are. My guess is here. 'Cause here's what I think. I think that they are really\ngonna want to be using their... high altitude flight. Out of Colorado Springs.\nOut of Colorado Springs. Yeah. So my guess is that they... are probably here or\non their way there. I think I've been to the circus 'cause this feels like I'm\na (bleep) clown right now. This is my drive home. This is the route that I take home\nfrom Salt Lake City or anytime I come this way.\nCrazy. So I've driven through\nthis canyon a bajillion times. Oh  beautiful. That's how they\nmake wind  you know. That's how they make wind. I think what we\nshould feel good about is that they got\na massive W today. And still  it's\npretty neck and neck. Maybe not geographically \nbut at least kind of like  effectively with the\ncards that we have. So that  you know... We should feel decent\nabout that  I think. Okay. We have looked at quite\na number of flights. It is unclear what we\nshould do  I would say. The one flight card\nthat we have doesn't seem to have a ton\nof great uses from here. Nah  I mean we could\ngo to Tulsa at like 10. But then from Tulsa \nwe might get a little sticky. Yeah  I think— It's gonna depend on\nwhat tickets pop up tomorrow. We just have to see\nThe Flop tomorrow morning. But yeah  it is 7 pm  so... We will see you here\nat 6 am Mountain Time. Okay.\nIt is 7 pm. It is 7 pm and we are ending our day here in the middle of nowhere  Utah. This is amazing timing\nbecause it's exactly 7 pm  and this is exactly the hotel\nwe wanted to stay at. So we don't have to drive\nanywhere tomorrow morning. Yay!\nSmall behind the scenes. Perfect! And we still got the pumpkin! Ben Jr. Ben Jr. Good night. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus As you can probably tell \nthat was... one of the more... chaotic days of... just my life. Certainly my time on Jet Lag. But there was a lot\nto handle between helping Michelle and\ncarrying a pumpkin. and strategizing at potentially\nthe most crucial moment in the game so far and filming. So I apologize\nfor what might not be the best cinematography\nyou've ever seen. I think it was the best\ncinematography I've ever seen. Thank you.\nI appreciate your support. But for kind of an additional\nlayer of analysis on ...that whole chaos \nplus our decision at the end  we talked all about it on our Nebula-exclusive\npodcast  The Layover. And The Layover  of course  is just one of many  many\nreasons to sign up for Nebula because it is  of course \nits own cool streaming service with amazing series from\npeople like RealLifeLore  who you may remember\nfrom earlier seasons. You've got documentaries from us. We did a whole documentary\nin Alaska  of all places. It's actually the\nfirst project that we three worked together and\ncollaborated on. So you can get more\nus in Alaska content. Very different types of stuff.\nVery different kind of content. Good.\nYeah  we're not on camera. But you can sometimes hear us\nbehind camera asking questions. Yeah.\nKinda fun. Yeah. And  I mean \nright now on Nebula – I watch Nebula all the time – right now I'm watching Taboo on Screen\nby Broey Deschanel. It kind of gets into the sort of\ntaboo subjects of filmmaking. And I've been watching\nthe first two episodes  which are about the...\nfor any of you who are as sort of terminally online as me  and you've been  sort of \nplugged into the Zoomer debate of whether we should just\nstop having sex scenes in movies at all  'cause\nGen Z is really puritanical. I'm Gen Z  but it's\nkind of weird  anyway. This show breaks it down. It's really interesting. And that's just one\nof the many things you can watch on Nebula. And look  if you're\ngoing to sign up for Nebula  you know  you gotta\ndo it with our link. Why? 'Cause you get 40% off an\nannual subscription when you use nebula.tv/jetlag and also when you use that— I'm gonna let you in\non a little secret  which is the way that Nebula\nfigures out that we sent you  so that they can give us\nmoney to fund the show is it's the people\nthat use our link. If you just go to Nebula\nwithout the link  they don't know that\nit's because of us  and we don't get\nanything from that. And then we can't\npay for all the airplanes. And then  that's bad. We can't pay for\nthe many airplanes we own. We're in a lot of debt. So anyway  you know \ngo to nebula.tv/jetlag  get that 40% off  watch the next episode now \nlisten to The Layover  watch Taboo on Screen \ndo all the things. There's so much more\non Nebula  and all you have to do\nis click the button here  or link in the description. See you there!"

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome to\nepisode five of our race from continental America's\nnorthernmost to southernmost town. Last episode  Michelle and I\nlost our sizable lead when Adam and Ben scooped\nthe ticket straight to Denver that we had been planning around. That means that right now \nwe're executing on our backup plan. We flew instead to Salt Lake City and set off on a five hour drive to the small town of\nMontrose  Colorado. From there  we'd be able to\nuse our high altitude flight to make it all the way to Dallas  then connect to New Orleans with the neighboring state flight\nwe stole from Ben and Adam. But there's a catch. This five-hour stretch\nof highway goes through one of the sparsest\nregions of America. So if a steal comes up on The Flop  we almost certainly\ncouldn't compete for it  and Ben and Adam would be\nable to steal our flight  leaving us stranded in Montrose. We're really hoping they\nwon't know to do that  since they seem to think\nthat we're already in Denver  but it's really all\ngoing to come down to how day 4's deck gets dealt. Good morning.\nGood morning. I'm hungover. It is nearly 6 am.\nHere's the thing  Michelle. We don't want them to\nthink where we are. Right  they need to think\nthat we are in the city of Denver. Yes. Should I play car sounds\nfrom my phone? That's too\ncomplicated  I think. (scoffs) YouTube video  10 hours \ncar sounds  Denver. And just like that  it's 6 am. Welcome to the baggage claim\nof Denver Airport. A place where we have\nbeen stressed out before and are stressed out again. Let's call them. It's 6. We're running\nto this Dairy Queen. So they think we're in Denver and not in the middle of\nfreaking nowhere  Utah. (wet mouth pops) This wall. The most\nnondescript wall. Hello. Good morning. ♪ Let's Flop tonight ♪ How you feeling  Michelle?\nA little hungover? A little unable to run around and do challenges  maybe? Ben  we're all\nprofessional athletes here. I can bounce back any time. This sucks.\nThis sucks. Okay.\nWhere are they  Ben? Let me— I simply don't know. Our first card on the Flop\nis number six. A non-stop to Milwaukee. Do a milk walkie. Walk 100 feet while balancing\na cup of milk on your head. Number seven \na 1 000 mile flight west if you ride a horse.\nJesus. This flight must land\nfurther west than it started. Number ten is a 400 mile car if you get a team mascot. Number fourteen is\nan 800 mile train if you eat a cracker\nin a Cracker Barrel. Alright  sounds good. Okay  bye! See you in Florida. Good luck!\nBye! Okay  this is\nreally good news. Because now we just go. Yeah  I think so.\nTo Montrose  right? The only reason\nto do any of it is if we want to prevent\nthem from doing any. But I don't think\nMilwaukee is that good. No  Milwaukee sucks. I think that we simply\nmust do a milk walkie. Yeah  I think that\nwe're going to want to do a milk walkie freaking ASAP. Alright  Ben. We need to get milk. Wait  wait  wait.\nUp this way  up this way. Okay  okay.\nYeah  yeah  yeah. No  that's really smart. Coffee place will definitely\nhave cups and milk. Hi  can we just get\ntwo cups of milk? Milk?\nYeah  just milk. You want hot or cold? Cold.\nCold's fine. How do you feel about your ability to balance milk on your head? I would say\nI feel better about it than I feel about your ability\nto balance milk on your head. I do not have a\ngreat sense of balance. Cut to some footage\nproving that. I did it! You okay? You okay? You okay? Whoa  whoa  you okay?\nYeah. There's plenty of\nfootage to prove that. To be honest \nI think the risk of them getting a steal is high. Extremely high. So we just need to— Horrifically high. We knew this  we knew this\ngoing into this. We knew that this was\na risky route. But as soon as we get\nto Montrose Airport  which is at 9:31 \nwe drop the rental car  and then we are able\nto book the flight. Okay  we're\nliterally not peeing for the next\nthree and a half hours. Are you ready for that  Sam? No. Thank you so much. Yes  sir. Let's go  let's go  let's go! We need to measure out\n100 feet. Okay  here. I have to get to the United sign. Okay  this is going to\nbe harder than I hoped. Okay. Okay  get real slow. Oh. Ugh. Okay  alright. Try again.\nTry again. We should have a couple of\nhours there before the flight where we could do\nchallenges if we wanted to. Correct. Which would\nprobably be worth doing. But I think once we\nget there  to be honest  I don't know if we could\nreasonably do either steal. So  our potential of getting\nsomething nabbed from us today? Very high.\nHigh. I think we just have to hope that\nthey don't use the steal correctly. This is a classic milk walkie. Textbook. I'm gonna get\nin front of you here. Excuse us  just doing\na milk walkie. Okay  that's it  that's 100 feet.\nLet's gooo! Alright  alright  we're calling 'em. That's huge.\nI mean  that's big. That's big.\nThat's a nice long flight. Obviously it goes north \nwhich is not ideal  but it's definitely worth it.\nIt's far. Okay  no response. Let's send them a video. Oh my god. Yep  as planned  they just did the milk walkie \nclearing a spot. Oh yeah  I wonder if\nthey'll go to Milwaukee then. I wonder  yeah \nI guess the question is  were they doing that to\nprevent us from getting it? Or were they doing it\nbecause they wanted it? Or were they just doing\nit because it was easy? I think they were doing it because it was easy. Well  the thing about Milwaukee\nis once you're in Milwaukee  it's kind of up there and all that. But it'd be pretty easy\nto get from Milwaukee to kind of the east coast. And from the east coast... They can do the\n1 000 mile flight west thingy? They could do that. Or they could potentially \nif they were fast  get on a sleeper train to Florida. (whispering) What? Okay  let's go\nto Milwaukee  baby. How soon can we get there? There should be pretty\nregular flights. One would think \none would hope. Soonest flight... Not 'til 11 am? Really? Is that real? How is that real? Not till 11 am? Not till 11 am. That's... not great. Okay  not good news. The next flight to Milwaukee is at 11 am at the earliest\non Southwest  which means that they\nare almost certainly ...doing challenges. Flop hasn't updated yet?\nI'm checking. Let's update the Flop. Yep. Okay. 450 mile flight. Get knighted at an American castle. Using a sword \nwhich may be makeshift  both teammates must\nknight each other outside of an American castle. Yes  okay. 450 mile flight. Get knighted\nat an American castle. Can we do that? No  but neither can they.\nOh  you just yes'd because it's not good for them  okay.\nYeah  yes. We can do this here \nand that'd be good. Really good to get. Castle Marne  39 minutes away. We do just have to\nfigure out how to get a sword. We have to figure out a sword. I mean  but it's\nallowed to be makeshift. So we can just make it\nout of anything. There's a park\nright outside of there. I'm sure we could get sticks. Let's go to Castle Marne. I'll do it now. Hi.\nGood morning. I think the\npossibilities are either they're doing the\nsmall aircraft thing  then probably not\ngoing to Milwaukee  or they're going to wait\nin Denver and do challenges  then fly to Milwaukee\nand go onward. I don't think I can make\nany confident conclusions  but there's little we can do to adapt to what they're\ndoing at this point. Right  our plan doesn't change. It's just my anxiety changes. And I would think\nit would go down  but it's continually increasing so. All we gotta do now is drive. Okie dokie. Ben  welcome to... something... No  film in front of the castle. Castle Marne. ♪ Ta-da ♪ We do need a makeshift sword. I mean  there are...\nmany sticks about. Yeah  but we\nwould need a legit one. We would need a legit one. Wait  look. There's a good big stick in here. Oof  that's true. Can't really get at it. No  I can get to it. Yeah  I don't know what\nthe rest of my plan was. (distant quacking)\nThose are the castle's ducks. I'm gonna film and\nsee if there are ducks. Ben  I did it. Ben  I need help.\nI need help. Okay. Okay  let's shape this\ninto an incredible sword. Yeah  it's a scimitar. Okay. I think certainly by recess rules  this is as legit as a sword can get. Alright  are you ready \nBenjamin? Let's set it up. One hour down \ntwo and a half to go. You know  in the\nwise words of someone... Go east  young man. I think what this season\nreally is all about is shout out to\nManifest Destiny  right? Shout out to colonialism. Because it's such—\nOh my god. It's such a big country \nyou know? Think about how far\nwe were away and how far we still have to go. And if not for all our\nmanifest destiners ...we couldn't make\nsuch a fun  silly  wacky YouTube travel competition\ngame show thing. For the record  I... I  I'm  uh  this  uh... I hereby dub thee Sir Ben  he of the sleepy—\nof the sleepy head. You are now a knight ...of... ...of... Denver  Colorado. Yeah! Adam  I dub thee Sir Milk Walkie. The fastest of walking\nwith milk on thine head. You are now a knight too of Denver  Colorado. We've done it. Let's go ahead\nand call our dear friends. If they ask where I am \nwhat do I say? They don't have\nthe right to know. Just say  like \n\"Wouldn't you like to know?\" So keep it just close to your face. Hello? You're in a car\nto Colorado Springs. Are you in a car to\nColorado Springs  Colorado? I'm not going\nto reveal any information. Yes. Well  I'll tell\nyou where we are. We're at a beautiful castle\nin Denver  Colorado. Check it out. Oh my god. And I don't want\nto intimidate you  but we are both knights now. Yeah  that's\npretty intimidating. Honestly  I'm so happy\nfor you guys. That's really cool. Well  have fun in Austin. Bye  girlies. Oh  is that Austin?\nNo-no-no. Probably  probably Houston. Or Dallas  maybe. Bye! You'll find out soon. (giggles)\nThat's interesting. Oh my god  they went to\nthe (bleep)-ing castle? Well  that's kinda what\nwe thought they would do. So that makes\nme think more likely that they're using\nthe Milwaukee card. So  time to Flop it up. ♪ Flop it up ♪\n♪ Flop it up ♪ ♪ Flop it up  baby \nwhen you head stop ♪ ♪ Never stop  never stop ♪ 600 mile train. Get a car to honk. Write anything on a sign that inspires a passing car\nto honk their horn. 600 mile train. Get a car to honk. Great  great  great  okay. They're gonna\ndo that quickly  though. Are they? Do they\neven want the train? 'Cause how— They might try\nto ride a horse next. Ooh  you know\nwhat actually might be da move? If we get the\n1 000 mile flight west. 'Cause what if we flew... Okay  this actually\nmight be the move  Ben. Okay. Okay.\nOkay. Okay  we actually have what I think is\na very good plan. And it's a cool plan. And it's cool. We're gonna fly\nto Milwaukee at 11. We're gonna go ahead\nand use that ticket. Actually book that in\njust a second. And then we'll drive to Chicago. That'll take about two hours. On the way \nwe'll eat a cracker in a Cracker Barrel \nget a train  And then we will take\na train overnight from Chicago to Pittsburgh. If we can get the\n1 000 mile flight west  we could fly straight from\nPittsburgh in the morning ...to either Orlando or Tampa. I think this is a very good plan. And the good news is\nwe have a car called to take us to a horse place. Let me tell ya  we... This place is not open. Nope.\nThey open at 8. We're just gonna show up and hope that they\nlet us ride a horse. Look  we just gotta be\nreal chill. We'll be like  \"Look  you're cowboys \nwe're cowboys. How's about a little\nfive-minute ride on the horse?\" We can be like \n\"Look  we are knights. We know what we're doing.\" We know what we're doing.\nAnd it's just like  \"Look  we'll give you the amount\nof money for a full lesson.\" It's Sam's money  we don't care. We'll pay you truly... I would pay you\nhundreds of dollars. I would pay you any amount\nof Sam's money  frankly. Okay  let's go meet a horse. I really hope that\nthey let us ride a horse. Hi. We're in Colorado \nwhich is just one step closer to our desired destination\nof Montrose  Colorado. And we're gaining altitude \nthat's what we need. We're at about 4 800 feet. We need another\n700 feet of elevation to be able to fly out. I'm so stressed. An hour and a half until we\narrive at the rental place  which effectively is\nan hour and a half until we can book the flight. So we're just praying\nthat Ben and Adam don't get a steal\nbetween now and then and try to steal one of our cards. And we've made it more\nthan halfway through the time  through the risky time\nthat we had to deal with. When they open at 8 \nwe can call them. It just stopped ringing? Yeah  that's what happened to me. This is  yeah  this is the place. I see horses. Do you see people  though? No. We need both horses and people to make this work. Thank you so much. Okay. Is there anybody at\nthis little booth? No. It says  \"Howdy  we are on\na trail ride  be back soon.\" Alright  well that's not good. That's not ideal. Let's see if\nwe can find somebody. Hi  excuse me \nare you guys open? We don't.\nWe don't. Okay. We're doing this scavenger hunt\nacross the country. One of the things we have\nto do is ride a horse. If we could just be on a\nhorse for a period of five minutes  that would be so incredible. Okay  let me call\nmy manager. Perfect.\nWe will— Thank you.\nFor sure  give me one moment. Thanks. Okay  this seems like a maybe? Seems like a maybe. Seems like a definite maybe. Welcome to\nGrand Junction  Colorado. I am usually here every\ntwo or three weeks because it's the nearest\ncity to where I live. About to pass the Chipotle \nwhich is my normal stop. It's the only Chipotle\nfor hundreds of miles. It's very exciting. There's a Chick-fil-A  but... I will not acknowledge whether\nor not I go to that on camera because that would be controversial. Said the person discussing the positives of colonialism a mere hour ago.\nLook... You know. I'm gonna end the clip here before you say something\nyou regret  Sam. Bye!\nColonialism is— —dirty. I'm literally shaking. Please  please  please  please. Please let us ride a horse. Please  somebody\nlet us ride a horse. Yes  hi.\nHi. The thing we're\ndoing is very stupid  and I'm sorry about that. We're doing a race across\nAmerica with our friends. We have to stop in different\nplaces and do challenges. And we have to ride a horse. So if it would at all be possible for one of us to ride\na horse for five minutes  we're happy to pay whatever\nthe amount is we would need to. So one thing I just\nrealized that is very good is that the second that\nwe book our Montrose flight  barring any flight delays  we are for sure getting\nto New Orleans tonight because they can't steal the\nneighboring state card back. Because we stole it first! Awesome! You can't re-steal flights\nthat you stole  so... We have to get on this plane.\nWe have to get on this plane. This is crazy\nbecause Ben and Adam probably have no idea\nthe stakes of them getting a steal\nin the next 75 minutes because they clearly\ndon't think we're doing anything like\nwhat we're doing now. No  they don't. This is good for us because we need to\nmake it through the next\none hour and 10 minutes without them stealing the... stealing our high altitude card. (yelps) Awesome.\nAmazing. (whispering)\nLet's go  baby! Oh  okay. Oh  sorry  okay. Bubba  my absolute guy. Nice and relaxed.\nHe-he-ha! (snorts) I can tell. They're just like us  Ben. They're really \nthey're two good boys. Two good boys\non two good boys. Oh  we're going.\nPull back just a little bit. He got excited. Well  we won. Look at this. Woo! And then just\nright back up there? Yeah.\nAlright. I think that we can call this\na challenge complete. Can I call our competitors\nto show them? Incredible.\nAmazing. Turn the car.\nWhat's your password? No  it doesn't matter.\nThey won't hear. They won't hear. Oh  there  join. Hello? Hello! Oh  they're on a horse. Oh my god! (cackles) Well done.\nOhhh! Well done. That's impressive.\nSo just step off? Thank you so much. Wow. I can't help but smile. I love it. We're in beautiful\nDenver  Colorado  and we've ridden a horse. Congratulations to us. Bye  bye \nbye  bye  bye  bye. Congrats  we gotta go. Let's move.\nLet's (bleep) move! Sam  this could be disaster. This genuinely \nif they pull  if they pull— Ah  I can't even (bleep) speak! Oh my god. Thank you all so much. Thank you so  so much.\nWe appreciate it. Good luck! We'll give your stable a shoutout.\nWe really appreciate it. We appreciate it.\nThank you. Let's goooo! Alright. We've locked it in.\nLet's absolutely go! That was fun. That was awesome! That's one of the best\nthings we've ever done. Well  you wanna know\nthe other thing? It's 9 am. The thing is \nif you wake up at 5  and then you just start sprinting to do things as fast as possible  you can do a lot of stuff. You'd be amazed\nwhat you can do. So we're 30 minutes\naway from the airport? It is... And if they pull a card and somehow get it off\nin the next 30 minutes? Hopefully they're— It'd be really tight if\nit was the right card. Do you have your phone\npulled up for the Flop? Oh  wait  we need\nto replace the Flop. ♪ Flop it up ♪\n♪ Flop  flop  flop it up ♪ ♪ Flop it when you're floppin'\nwhen your head stops ♪ (beatboxing) ♪ Flop it— ♪ This is make or break. This is make or break right now.\n(chuckles nervously) 800 mile train. Join the American literary canon. Go to any location described\nin any published American novel and do or say what\nthe character in the novel does or says there. You must be able to\nreference the exact passage. Still nothing? Yes! We're good? We're good?\nYes! We're good. An 800 mile train? Now there's an easy one. Join the American literary canon. Okay  great. And we need a train. We do need a train. I love that the Flop is\nfull of trains right now. Because I don't think they're\ngoing to be using a train  and we actually might\nuse a couple. And there's three trains\nin the Flop right now. So that's really great. That is so good.\nThat is so good. I think that— I don't— I think they're not gonna\n(bleep) with it anymore. I think that just secured us\nour route to New Orleans. So now we are going\nto fly to Milwaukee. From there  go to Chicago\nand hop on our train overnight to Pittsburgh. Then in the morning  we will use our 1 000 mile\nflight that goes west to fly directly from Pittsburgh all the way to probably\nOrlando or Tampa. There are direct flights\nto both those places. And then we are really within striking distance.\nAnd we'll be  I mean  you know...\ninches from Key West. And hopefully they don't... (bleep) with us at all and we can just\nactually do all of that. I'd like to see them beat that. Look  welcome to Montrose. Welcome indeed. I kinda can't believe\nwe got all the way here. Enterprise! We have made it\nto the promised land. Oh my god  we're here. I'm gonna pull in more.\nStop the car! Stop the car! Alright.\nClicking pay now. Come on.\n(squeals) Oh. Here  Michelle. What?\nWe got it. We got it. We got it! We're going to Dallas! Sam! No one has ever\nbeen this excited about going to Dallas. Oh my god. Alright  let's\nhead to the airport. Alright. It's  what  it's Blucifer. It's Blucifer. Whoa  did you see him?\nYeah. Whoa. I think we've explained\nBlucifer on this show before. We've explained\nBlucifer before on this show. It seems like\nit would be a joke. But it's a  just  it's real. It's a real statue.\nIt's a real statue. It's terrifying. And it killed the person\nwho created it. That horse killed someone. Not our horses.\nOur horses are good boys. Bubba was incredible. Yeah  as was Copper. Thank you very much. Okay. It's a very petite airport  but it's definitely not\nthe smallest airport we've been to so far this week. Oh yeah \nUtqiagvik was one room. That one was not\nquite as fancy as this. I can't believe\nwe were at the top of Alaska Yeah.\n...three days ago. Ohhhh. Okay  well  we're about to\nboard our flight to Milwaukee. But still no word from\nSam and Michelle. We haven't heard from\nthem all day. I mean  we've called\nthem to tell them we've completed challenges. But so far they have not\nearned a single ticket. What do you think\nthey're up to? My guess is that they\nare in Colorado Springs  and they're about to  or have\njust gotten on a flight to... like Houston or Dallas. That would be\na pretty good move. Be quite good. And to them...\nI say good luck. Because... our plan is... ironclad. Ironclad plan. Unless a steal comes up in which case\nbad things might happen. Unless a steal comes up  in which case it could be bad. Alright  we've been\nsitting here for two hours now  literally researching non-stop  in the lovely Montrose Airport. (giggles) Basically trying to\nfigure out our endgame. Yeah. Yeah. We've narrowed it\ndown to a few options. And they're all\nreally nerve wracking  to be honest.\nI know. (giggles) But we're about\nto board a flight to Dallas  and we have no idea\nwhere we're going after this. Yep. But we have to get on\nanother flight today. Yes. Definitely. For sure. This is what happens when you're the last ones\nto book on Southwest. Yeah  they put you real— They hate you. They want you dead. And it's truly\na battle royale in there. Yeah. Alright. Little delayed \nbut we're getting on. I know  we're getting on \nand that's a good thing. Yeah. Alright  let's go. Hello  welcome to beautiful\nMilwaukee  Wisconsin. ♪ We're in Milwaukee ♪ Is that the Milwaukee jingle? That's my new jingle. Okay  this way  this way. So there's a train\nfrom Milwaukee to Chicago that leaves in about 40 minutes. So we're gonna need to\nearn a train ticket. There's three available. I think we can\nget a car to honk if we go to baggage claim. Yeah  probably. What do you think would get\npeople in Milwaukee to honk? It's Wisconsin.\nThey like the Packers. They like Packers.\nThey like cheese. Honk if you love cheese. That feels offensive. We could say honk\nif you hate Chicago. Don't people in Milwaukee\nhate Chicago? They do have beef with Chicago. That is illegible. \"Honk ifu\"? \"If U.\" My sign is complete. I didn't really leave\nenough room to finish mine. That guy does not\nlove Milwaukee. That guy did not do it. Maybe this person will. No? She hates Milwaukee. She was not interested. Adam  I think the shuttle\nis parked over there. We gotta go. Hi  we're trying to go to\nthe Amtrak station. This go to the Amtrak station? Thank you. Alright. I didn't do a very good job. \"Honk if you hate Chicago.\"\nYou can't really read Chicago. No  I think that reads. Thank you very much. Thank you. Here  come on. There's no cars right now. Which isn't great. Oh  there's a car. Is it coming this way?\nIt's coming this way. Okay  we gotta be\nreally eager about it. Okay. No. She was not having it.\nNo. She was not having it. She was not interested\nin our bull-(bleep) This is not good. The train leaves in 15 minutes. We've seen one car. I think there's somebody\ncoming your way  Ben. Oh  they're turning into the... Oh  maybe we could\nget them like this. Wait  there's a truck! No! No. No. Okay  another one coming. Honk if you love Milwaukee. Yeah  yeah  there you go. Okay  I'm gonna be\nreally excited. Here we go \nwe got two cars coming. (honk-honk) Yeah!\nYeah! Woo! Okay  let's go! Alright  alright \nalright  alright. We gotta call them \nwe gotta book the train. You call them  I'm gonna book. Okay. Oh  by the way  we're discarding our\n600 mile small aircraft. Okay  they're not picking up. I'll send a video. Okay  hello  Sam and Michelle. We are in the beautiful \nalbeit very wet  city of Milwaukee. And we have just\ngotten a car to honk using a sign. That is the update. The Flop will be updated shortly. We have our ticket.\nWe're booked. Train leaves in 10 minutes. Easy as pie.\nHere's a plane. Hello! Now we are off to Chicago. That lady's\ngonna be on our train. All these people hate us. Undoubtedly. It's fine. Okay  new card on the Flop. 700 mile flight. Eat an alliterative sandwich. Create and eat the entirety of\na sandwich with five fillings  all of which must start\nwith the same letter. That's an interesting one. It's a 700 mile flight between any two cities that start\nwith the same letter. Perfect. I have found in simulations that it is\npretty dang hard to use. My guess is that it's\nnot really going to fit into either team's plan at this point  but we'll see. 3:38 to Chicago. Ben  we're finally on a train. We're going to Chicago. Okay  so just one\nother thing to point out. They haven't done a\nsingle challenge all day. It's one of those things\nthat seems good at first  and then it starts to get scary. Yeah. Like  what are they doing? We've arrived in Dallas. We have a plan. Just... trust us.\nWe do. And again \nit's extremely risky. Just trust us. Okay  here's the plan. Our plane got in too late for us to make our flight\nto New Orleans tonight. But it's fine  because we're\ngonna do something even better. Remember how before  we really didn't want\nthe steals to pop up? Well  now that we're\nsafely in Dallas  and now that Ben and Adam have\na concerningly powerful hand  well  now we really want\nthe steals to pop up. There are two steals\nin today's deck  and we've identified\nplaces in Dallas where we can do both. One involves going to\na muffler man  which Dallas has two of. And one requires you to stand\nin a spot Elvis has stood. And in 1955  Elvis played\nat the Dallas Sportatorium  which was later torn down and is now an open field\nthat we can easily access. We're gonna head to a Walmart that's equidistant from both the\nSportatorium and a muffler man to grind challenges and see if we\ncan force one of these steals up. We just need to make sure none pop up before\nwe're in position. It's crops. Yes. Yes. Yes! Finally. It's hot! Yeah. Hi  [for] Sam? Hey  how's it going? Welcome to Chicago. Now  we are making a\nbeeline for Grant Park. Because we were able to find a passage from\nThe Time Traveler's Wife that took place in Grant Park. All we have to do is go there \nread the passage  act it out  and we will have our\ntrain to Pittsburgh. The reason that\nwe're running is that there's only two rooms\nleft on the train  and I really don't\nwant them to fill up. And also because \non the off chance  if Sam and Michelle\ndecide to do this... it would completely\nruin our whole plan. How do we get out of here? Wow. Yeah  I will say it is\nvery windy right now. So that's fun. Where you going?\nHeading to Grant Park. Thank you! Alright  what do I do  Ben?\nWelcome to Grant Park. Okay here's what's gonna happen. I am going to read this passage\nfrom The Time Traveler's Wife in my best audiobook voice. And you just act it out.\nYou're the time traveler  okay? Okay.\nOkay  okay. Are you ready? It's cold. It's very  very cold. And I am here  lying\non the ground in snow. Oh  okay  wait  wait  wait. Where am I? I try to sit up. My feet are numb. I can't feel my feet. I'm in a very open space\nwith no buildings or trees. How long have I been here? It's night. I hear traffic. I get to my hands and knees. I look up. I'm in Grant Park. And here we are in Grand Park! Woo! And that's earned us\na nice  juicy train. Okay  okay  I'm gonna— Let's go ahead and\ncall Sam and Michelle. Call  and then\nwe need to book ASAP. Hello? Hey.\nHello. Hello? I think they're in an Uber. We are in beautiful Grant Park\nin Chicago  Illinois  and we have just joined the\nliterary American canon. Cool.\nCongratulations. Good luck doing whatever\nit is that you're doing. The Flop will\nupdate in just a moment. Okay.\nLook forward to it. Bye.\nBye. Bye-bye now.\nBye! (bleep) Oh my god. Alright. Unless a steal comes up \nwe're golden. Alright. Famous last words. Yep. 300 mile car. Send an anonymous threat. Using a device that is not yours  from an anonymous email address  email the other team a threat. Please. Oh  good. A pedestrian 300 mile car. Just nothing...\nWe're safe for now. Where... are they? Where are they and\nwhat the hell are they doing? What have they been doing? Why haven't they done\na single challenge? I feel like—\nIt's freaking me out. Look  you know what? It doesn't matter. Because we are about\nto book our train to Pittsburgh.\nOkay  okay  okay. Okay  okay  okay  okay. So  the funny thing is we\nactually can't go to Pittsburgh because it would\nget in too early for us to get off of the train. So what we actually have to do is book to  like  Connellsville.\nConnellsville. Then  unfortunately  we are gonna have to\ndrive back to Pittsburgh  and that will take an hour. But look  I know\nthat the audience is absolutely achin' for a\nshot of Connellsville. Two rooms left  baby. Woo! Let's absolutely goooo! Brap  brap  brap \nbrap  brap  brap  brap. And I have booked our train. Well let's mosey on back\nto Chicago Union Station. I am hungry  and\nthat train doesn't leave for an hour and forty minutes  and I think we should\nget dinner in Chicago. Let's get some dinner\non the way. Alright  so  our two locations \nif we have to blaze it  are Sportatarium and\nRay's Muffler. Yup. Have a good day \nand good luck! Thank you.\nThank you so much. Excuse me  where are\nthe stuffed animals? Stuffed animals? (indistinct)\nOkay  thank you. Here at Lou Malnati's. We may have just won the game. A miracle has happened. We discovered a new route \nwhich is: 10:30 am  Pittsburgh to Charlotte. Using our 450 mile\nunrestricted flight. Then 1:20 pm \nCharlotte to Key West. Key West is 736 miles and it is west of Charlotte. That's a pretty good time. That gets us into\nKey West at like 3:30. 3:36. That's crazy. Feels like a winning route. That's gonna be hard to beat. Unless they can steal our cards. Does this work?\nMaybe the smallest one. Oh.\nYeah. We have our mascot. Let's check out. I'm getting ready to FaceTime them. What's our mascot's name? Why do you always\nstand in front of walls? You have to tell us where you are. We're in Dallas  Texas \nand this is our new mascot. His name is Ben III. Wow. And that is an iconic\nlooking mascot right there. Flop-date? Okay. Uh-oh.\nWhat? Ohhh. (bleep) Steal. Steal Elvis' spot. Stand anywhere that Elvis stood. You must be able to prove\nthat Elvis stood there. That's great. That's great. Go  call the Uber.\nCall the Uber now. Okay. Are we anywhere near somewhere that Elvis was? Let's look. Okay  so it's\nDallas Sportatarium  right? Dallas Sportatarium. How do you spell that? S-P-O-R-T— It's just him... On stages.\nOn stages. It's all stages. Can we get on the stage\nat Chicago Stadium? No. Okay  we also need to leave. I need a fast driver \nand I need a clear road. Why don't I have service here?! I can't load anything. Let me try restarting my phone. Okay  great. Come on  come on. Has he ever been to Den— to Chicago Union Station? Wait  wait  is that Elvis? Is that Elvis? Is that Elvis in Union Station? No  that's him in Penn Station. (bleep) Why does everything\ntake so long today?! So much waiting and\nwaiting and waiting. Okay  what's it looking like now? It's still coming.\nThree minutes. Okay  the car is\njust about to arrive. I'm watching a video from 1957 of crowds waiting\nfor Elvis in Chicago. But it's not clear if he's\ngoing to walk outside. How many minutes?\nHow many minutes? How many minutes? Sam! Still three. Sam.\nNow it says one minute. That's her. Sick. Hi! Thank you.\nFor Sam? Yes  for Sam. Look  we don't need this steal. No  we don't need this steal.\nWe don't need it at all. We need them to not get it. The Flop will reset\nin the morning. So if they can't get it in\nthe next hour  then it's gone. It has to be the exact spot. Yeah. Our entire strategy\nis based around this ticket not getting stolen. Yeah  if they steal the\n1 000 mile flight west... We are in  I would call it\nmassive trouble. That is... what I feared. Oh (bleep) Oh my god \nwhere the (bleep) are we? The finale is up right now\non Nebula. The finale is up right now\non Nebula. The finale is up right now\non Nebula.

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome to the finale of our race\nfrom continental America's northernmost to\nsouthernmost town. Right now  we're at\nthe end of day four  and it's still anybody's game. We're in Dallas \nBen and Adam are in Chicago  and both teams have a viable\npath to the finish line with the tickets\nalready in their hand. Ben and Adam's route is\nset to get them to Key West a few hours before\nMichelle and I  but we might have\na way to stop them. With only an hour left in the day  a steal just came up on The Flop. We knew this might happen  so Michelle and I had\nalready researched a spot to complete the challenge: the former site of the\nDallas Sportatorium. If we can stand exactly\nwhere Elvis stood in the middle of the\nformer stadium  we'll earn the steal\nand use it to sabotage Ben and Adam's path to victory. The only question is  can we actually get to\nthe spot where Elvis stood? Oh (bleep) Okay  hopefully we can get to what feels like the center. Oh my god.\nWhere the (bleep) are we? What's the field? Our entire strategy\nis based around this ticket not getting stolen. Yeah  if they steal the\n1 000 mile flight west... We are in  I would\ncall it massive trouble. Oh.\nIt's us. Thank you. Let's figure out where our train is. We still have 25 minutes. If there's a picture somewhere\nof Elvis in downtown Chicago  we could maybe still\ntry to make it happen? Yeah. Here  let's stay close to the exit. Just in case. What does\nit say on Google Maps? What are the pictures? I mean  it's right here. Oh  okay  no. It's more towards\nthe side of the street. Okay. Is this it? I think—\nCan we do it? Okay  look at here.\nLook at here. So it's the center\nof that thing  right? Yes.\nSo it's— Look how— And it's on the corner  yes. Perfect.\nSo it forms— We're standing\nwhere Elvis stood. Okay  yeah. It's right here.\nThis is where Elvis stood! It is marginal  but— This is where Elvis stood. Look at the geometry\nform a circle around here. And then think about the center. Yes.\nIt is here. Let's call them. Yes  call them. I'm pretty sure that's\ngoing to be indisputable when you look at the\nsatellite map  but... No way. Gentlemen? No way. You won't believe\nhow close it is. We have verifiable\nevidence that Elvis stood just outside of this fence\nin a now-destroyed venue called the Dallas Sportatorium. Wait  wait  wait. Do you have a picture?\nYou have an exi— Do you have a picture\nof him exactly there? There's a video right there. Yeah  there's a video\nof him performing here. You're standing\nwhere the stage used to be? Yes.\nYes. How do you know exactly\nwhere the stage used to be? We have a satellite map. (sigh) Alright. I mean  do you see any way\nin which this is not legit? No  no  it's fine. Okay  well  in that case... We're doing it? Yeah. We would like to steal a card. You have two options. We have a 450 mile\nunrestricted plane and a 1 000 mile flight\nthat has to go west. We would like to take\nyour 100 mile flight that goes west.\n1 000. 1 000 mile flight\nthat goes west. We did expect as much. I apologize. Should we do a quick Flop? Flop it up  Flop it up. 11 is a 400 mile card \nsmuggle goods. Okay. We gotcha. Okay  bye.\nBye. I'm sorry  Adam. I'm so— Adam  I'm sorry. Bye. Oooohhh!\nOhhhh my god! Alright. Okay  well... That throws\na wrench in the works. A very large wrench. I don't know.\nI don't know  man. I mean  I think we still\nget on this train  right? Let's go get on the train. Let's get on the train. Alright  I think we\nneed to get to the airport. I'll call an Uber.\nYeah  yeah. Hey  for Sam? Yeah.\nHey  how's it going? What's the last name? What's that? It's under Chase.\nWhat's your last name? Chase. Chase? Ah!\nYeah. You guys are going to\nConnellsville  right? Yes.\nYeah. Perfect! You guys\nare actually right here. These are your new brothers. Been looking for y'all all day. I know  right?\n(attendant laughs) Top of the stairs  take a left. Thank you. B. Look  Ben  it's our room. It's our room. I'm trying to figure out\nwhat we can do. What  if anything  could be done? (sigh) Look  they're\nending the day in Dallas. They're in (bleep) Dallas. They're still a bit of a ways. I don't really know\nwhat they're gonna do. These are truly\nsome big red flags. Oh my god \nthis is perfect timing. Yeah.\nLiterally  it is 6:59 and we are pulling\ninto the airport hotel. Five  four  three  two... Hi  AD. Welcome to our room. Ben is standing right\nnow in the foyer. That's sort of a great place\nto hang out and chill. We've got a nice\nlittle closet in here in which you can put... Two jackets. Two jackets  maybe. There's the big couch here. These will become two beds. This seemingly is the light switch. No  that is something else. Yeah  so this isn't\na game show anymore. It's just sort of a travel vlog. And from a travel vlog perspective  I'm having a great time. If I were involved in a game show  I would potentially be quite\nconcerned at the moment. But  I'm not. Things were so good\nabout an hour ago. We basically had\nthe win all locked up. We fully were going to win. We were going to be\nin Key West by 3:30. Now... Now I don't think we\nwill be in Key West at 3:30  to be honest with you.\nNo  there... It's still possible ...is all I'll say. Look  here's what I'll say. If it's Popsicle  it's possible. And I certainly believe\nthat it's Popsicle. This is sort of interesting. This is our bathroom/shower. It's a shower\nwith a toilet in it. I've never seen a\nshower with a toilet in it. That's kind of a\ndream scenario  actually. You can be doing two\nawesome things at the same time. You can be doing two\nawesome things at the same time. I'm gonna be honest \nthis feels incredibly risky. Oh my gosh. This is nuts. Hello. Hello and welcome to\nBen's Shower Corner. Today  we are\nshowering on the train. It's very weird\nbecause I can still feel that I'm moving on the train. That concludes Ben's Shower Corner. I'm in my cage. It's bedtime. It's bedtime.\nOh  you have a little cage so you don't fall out.\nI have a little cage so I don't fall out\nand die in the night. Yeah  we'll see\nyou in the morning. And now  the final rest period. We'll be starting day five in Dallas  and Ben and Adam should wake up\nsomewhere in Pennsylvania. Their train stops in Pittsburgh  but it leaves the city before\nthe day officially starts  so Ben and Adam will\nhave to get off on the train's next stop\nin Connellsville and find some way to\nget back to Pittsburgh  or another smaller airport  if they want to catch a flight\ntomorrow morning. Without their\n1 000 mile flight west  their path to victory will\nbe tough  but not impossible. If they manage to earn the\nright tickets tomorrow  there are still plenty\nof flights to Key West from cities like\nCharlotte and Atlanta that get in before we can. So without further ado \nday five. Ohh  good morning. Good morning  Adam.\nHello. It would seem that\nwe are getting into beautiful Connellsville a little bit late. Which means we're\ngoing to be on the train when the Flop happens. Which means— You can't do challenges\nwhen you are on transportation. Yeah. It is just before 6 am \nand we are ...so very back. Yeah! Hey! (giggles) So we're just waiting. We are.\nFor a call. Hello. Hello. Hello  can you Flop  please? Yeah.\nReady. Fourteen is the first one. Okay. That's a steal.\nYep. (whispering) That's a steal! (bleep) Second one is one. Okay. That's fine. The third one is eleven. Okay. I just hear Adam's brain\ngoing a million miles an hour. Okay  and the last one is three. Okay  got it. Bye. Bye.\nBye. Okay  go \nwe've got  wait  Sam. We've got to\nget to the airport. This is crazy. Okay  that was not as bad\nas it could have been. Okay  there is that steal  but— That's a big one. It's completely irrelevant to us. Ugh  yeah  but we\nneed to slow them down. As you can tell  we are\nnot yet in Connellsville. We are going to be\ngetting into Connellsville about... 45 minutes late? Something like that. So we are still here\non the train. And we cannot do anything until... No  we can research. We can research. That's it. Um... So... Okay  but—\nLet's go over our game plan. The game plan... Yeah  we didn't have time\nto explain it last night. (giggles)\nThe game plan is basically... We're going to Birmingham. Alabama.\nAlabama. We booked that flight\nthe second that we got here so that they couldn't steal it. So basically\nlast night when we landed  we used our... Random.\nRandom airline ticket that we got at Artie McPhee to book an American Airlines\nflight for this morning. (sighs) Oh  good. I'm glad to hear that news. Yep. So this flight's been locked in \nwhich has been nice. Yeah  and the cool thing  yeah  you want to know how far\nBirmingham Airport is from Dallas-Fort Worth Airport? 592 miles. (snickers) Out of the maximum 600. The reason why we're\ngoing to Birmingham... Well  we'll show you\nonce we get there. But it makes a lot of sense.\nYes. It's a great plan  I think. And I think it's better than whatever Ben and Adam\ncan do from Huntington  West Virginia\nor wherever they're going. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good one. You too.\nYou too. Ben  welcome to Connellsville. We have made\nit to Connellsville. Alright  what the hell\ndo we do now? Well  here's the situation. We need a car to get out of here  but there is no car on The Flop. So  we just have to start\nworking on other stuff. Hopefully slow them down. Yeah. And hope a car shows up soon. I guess my question\nwould be  what do we do? I think we should start\nworking on memorizing everything. You think we should\nmemorize everywhere? Alright  let's get in the gazebo. Are we allowed\nto go in that gazebo? It seems to be a\npublicly accessible gazebo. So  this challenge\nis a reference to \"I've Been Everywhere\"\nby Johnny Cash  which is actually not the\noriginal version of the song. The original version of the song\nis about places in Australia. Johnny Cash did a version with ...places in North America. Yeah  you're talking so slowly  and we need to\nmemorize these things. There are four stanzas with places. And so I'll take the first two  and you take the second two.\nGreat. I've been to Reno  Chicago \nFargo  Minnesota  Buffalo... You absolutely\ncannot do it out loud. Elevator. I've been to Boston \nCharleston  Dayton  Louisiana  Pittsburgh... Washington  Houston \nKingston  Texarkana  Parkersburg \nGravelburg  Colorado... Monterey  Faraday \nSanta Fe  Tallapoosa  Ellensburg... Glen Rock  Black Rock \nLittle Rock  Oskaloosa... (winces) Tennessee to Tennessee \nChicopee  Spirit Lake  Graham Lake  Devils Lake \nCrater Lake  for Pete's sake. Louisville  Nashville... Monterey  Faraday \nSanta Fe  Tallapoosa  Monterey... Hi.\nWelcome. Okay.\nI think I've got it. I've been to Reno  Chicago... Fargo  Minnesota... One second. Buffalo  Toronto \nWinslow  Sarasota... Wichita  Tulsa \nOttawa  Oklahoma...

(whispering) Shoot. Been to Boston... Houston.\nNope. I'm afraid the\nnext is Charleston. Shoot. It's time for the final... Zodiac Zone! So Sam  have I made you a\nbeliever in astrology this week? (gasp) I am seriously\nnot making this up. This is what Co-Star says\nabout me and Sam. It says  \"You and Sam are\nboth searching for something.\" Kinda true. \"You're looking for\na beach day.\" It literally says\ngood for beach days. Can we talk about how\nCo-Star literally said we're both good for\na beach day today? Nyeh? That's crazy! It says  Adam. \"Adam is working through\ntheir insecurities.\" Boston  Charleston \nDayton  Louisiana  Washington  Houston \nKingston  Texarkana. One second. Monterey  Faraday \nSanta Fe  Tallapoosa  Glen Rock  Little Rock \nBlack Rock  Oskaloosa  Tennessee to Tennessee \nChicopee... Spirit Lake  Grand Lake \nCrater Lake  Devil's Lake. Yep.\nOkay. Alright  let's see if\nI've still got mine in my head. Louisville  Nashville \nKnoxville  Ombabika. Yep.\nFurthermore  we've got Schefferville  Jacksonville \nWaterville  and Costa Rica. We've got Pittsfield \nSpringfield. We've got Bakersfield \nwe've got Shreveport. How's about Hackensack \nCadillac  Fond du Lac. And after Fond du Lac\nis Davenport. Nice. Idaho  Jellico \nArgentina  Diamantina. Pasadena  Catalina.\nPerfect. The next verse is Pittsburgh... Parkersburg \nGravelbourg  Colorado. Yep. Ellensburg  Rexburg \nVicksburg  El Dorado. Very good. Laramore. Mhm. Admore.\nYep. Haverstraw.\nYep. Chatanika.\nYes. Chaska  Nebraska. Ala—\nChaska  Nebraska... Alaska. Opelika.\nYep. Yep  yep. Then we got Baraboo. We got Waterloo \nKalamazoo  Kansas City  Sioux City  Cedar City \nand Dodge City. Yes! Okay. Wow  that was... I don't know if that\nwas good content  but that was incredible\nthat we did it. I feel pretty good about that. Pray that a car comes up. Yeah.\nPray that a car comes up. Really need that. Alright  we'll send them a video. Okay  we're about to take off\nto go to Birmingham  but we just got a video\nfrom Ben and Adam. Hello. Hello  Sam and Michelle. We have memorized everywhere. Everywhere  we've memorized it.\nWe've memorized pretty much everywhere.\nOh  and we come to you from I don't even remember now.\nWhere are we? We are in the—\nCollinsville. The lovely\nCollinsville  Pennsylvania. Collinsville  Pennsylvania. Good luck! Okay  they're going for it. They're in Collinsville \nPennsylvania. They memorized the song. They are professional memorizers\nat this point  I think. Yeah  that's impressive. Where could they be going\nwith that everywhere card  though? I don't know. Okay  let's find out\nwhere they're going. Alright  new card on The Flop. 800 mile flight. Become Florida Man. Recreate one of the\nfollowing two headlines  with one team member\nas the Florida Man: Florida Man attacked while\ntaking selfie with squirrel. Florida Man found with drugs\nwhile trapped in a Port-A-Potty. We must become Florida Man. Okay  so we desperately \ndesperately  desperately need this. Yeah  okay  so we need\nto find a squirrel or a Port-A-Potty  and we would need\nto get drugs. Surely there\nshould be a squirrel. Squirrel or a Port-A-Potty. I think a squirrel would be easier. If we  Ben  if we— Slow down  slow down. We're trying to look. Okay  here's the thing  Ben. If we get this ticket  I think we have a genuine\nchance of winning. I'm with you. I'm with you. And it seems like this—\nThere should be— Just look out for squirrels\nand Port-A-Potties  please. Here  let's try going to the park. The park will be good to check\nfor Port-A-Potties or squirrels. I don't see any squirrels. You keep watch \nyou keep watch here. I'm gonna check over there. Oh! Adam  squirrel. (whispering)\nWhere? Where? You do it  you do it \n'cause I can't see it. I can't see it anymore. It just went up\nin that tree though. I feel like we can only\nsee it when it moves. We're like apex predators\nin that way. Sleuthing Sam is on the case. Can it get them to... It can get them to Atlanta. Oh no. That's crazy. Could they get to Atlanta\nbefore us though? Possibly. 'Cause then they\nmight go Atlanta–Miami  or Atlanta–something else. Yeah  I'm sure. Oh  that would be bad. That would be bad.\nThat would be very bad. Hi there  this is\ngonna sound a little silly  but my friend and I are doing a scavenger hunt\nacross the country  and we need to take\na photo in a Port-A-Potty. Would it be possible to do that\nwith one of your Port-A-Potties? We will pay any amount\nto rent it or anything. We just need to literally\nuse it for one second. I mean not even\nuse it  use it  but like... Okay  yeah  I called a\nPort-A-Potty rental service. And they're gonna call me back. Hopefully they call us\nback with good news. But first we have to get drugs. So Adam has found a pharmacy \nand we're gonna go there now. And then  hopefully... I don't know  we\ncould always come back and try to look for the squirrel. The squirrel just moves so fast. Good morning. And this is going to be an\nextremely silly question. We're doing a scavenger hunt \nand we have to find a Port-A-Potty. You don't have any idea where\none would be in town  do you? Well  there should be\none down across the ballfield in North End. Okay. So just up here  you think? Yeah.\nIt's gotta be. Okay  great.\nThank you so much. Thank you so much. That's a 12 minute walk.\nI think we should jog. Might as well try  right? Yeah. Yeah  Meadow Lane.\nYeah  this way. Yeah  you see Port-A-Potties? Okay. Alright  give me the drugs. Okay. I have to get trapped  so... Yeah  I'll trap you in there. Tie my hands together. Use my jacket \ntie my hands together. Okay. Okay. Okay  now  get me in here. Get in there!\nI'm trying to get out. I'm trying to get—\n(door clattering) I would say that he is\ntrapped in there with drugs. And so... We got it  we got it \nwe got it  we got it. Let's call 'em.\nYes! That is huge! That is huge. (slaps rapidly) We are back in it  baby! Alright  time for The Flop. Once again  in order\nto go anywhere... We need to get to Pittsburgh.\nWe need still need a car. And we currently have\nthree flights actually. That's true. (sniff  chuckles weakly) We're gonna have to drop one. Ultimately  yeah. Alright  here we go. Okay  so the next card to\ncome up on The Flop was this: Pop a kernel of corn\nfor a 400 mile train. It's not what Ben and Adam\nneeded to escape Connellsville  but they figured they\ncould knock it out easily  so they ran to a nearby pharmacy to get popcorn  a lighter \nand a hair straightener. I was curious\nwhat this was about. Oh  it's a whole thing. It turns out  popping\na single kernel of corn wasn't as easy as it\nlooked on Instagram. So they went back into\nthe pharmacy and asked if they could\nuse the microwave. Is there any chance that\nyou have a microwave somewhere in a break room that\nyou could throw it into? (wheezes) Sure? Can we come in\nor stay out here? Yeah  just stay out there.\n(giggles) (beep  microwave hums) (kernels popping) Heyyy!\n(giggles) And  after popping their corn  a car ticket finally\ncame up on The Flop. All they had to do was\nfind all the letters of one of their names in graffiti. But in Connellsville  that also\nturned out to be pretty tough. Look at this. I've never seen such\na clean writing. Ugh. Not a single letter. This town is immaculate. This actually\ncould be an issue. Tunnel.\nTunnel? Tunnels are prime spot\nfor graffiti. Okay  shine a light on it. There are a lot of letters in here. Oh wait  little letters. A... D... A.\nYeah  A-D. We just need an M. It says\n\"Free (bleep) slowing.\" \"Free (bleep) showing\"? \"Free (bleep) showing.\"\nOh  whoa. I hope we don't miss\nthe free (bleep) showing. \"My\"— M  M. That's Adam. Boom  baby. That's a car  okay. ♪ Boom  baby girl ♪ Okay  now that\nwe have our car  we are going to do\nour best to try and start heading towards Pittsburgh.\nThe only problem is... This town is very small. So getting an Uber here \nespecially an Uber that far away... It's not going to be easy.\nIt's not going to be easy. What are we looking at? I don't know how they're\ngonna get to Pittsburgh Airport. 'Cause best I can tell  there's\nno rental car place there. So Pittsburgh Airport is\noutside of their radius  so they're going to have\ntrouble getting there. They might\nbe trying to get a car. They could be  yeah. That'll take them time. Alright  we've arrived\nin Birmingham  Alabama. Alabama! I'm gonna hit submit\nand reserve the rental car. Yes! Yes!\nMeans they can't steal it. They can't steal it! This is huge. Okay. Okay  getting on the\ninterstate there. Yep. I-20. And we will explain everything. So right now  we are driving\ndirectly east on Interstate 20 to the world's busiest airport: Atlanta Hartsfield–Jackson\nInternational Airport. Where... And it's a mouthful.\nAt 3 pm today... there is a direct flight to Key West  Florida. ♪ Let's go! ♪ That we have\nthe right to get onto and they can't steal that right because Georgia  Florida's...\nWe stole it! Georgia  Florida—\nGeorgia is Florida— borders. (giggles) We are so out of commission.\nThey cannot prevent us from getting this flight. And that is because\nwe stole this ticket from them. There is a closing window of\nthings that can go wrong for us. (wheezes)\nSam  why are you saying— Oh my god  with your history  it is so bold of you to\nsay something like this. Yeah  yeah. Wait  I've got an Uber.\nI got one. I've got an Uber.\nYou've got an Uber? Yeah.\nTo the airport? Yeah.\nYeah? I didn't even realize. Oh my god  yeah. Okay  well  we finally\nmanaged to get a car. Yeah  it only took \nwhat  like 45 minutes? Look  I just didn't think\nit was gonna even happen. No  I was getting\nreally scared. But  this car will take us to Pittsburgh Airport. We'll be there in about an hour. And then we will get on\na 1 pm flight to Atlanta. We could use our 450 miler\nto go to Orlando  or we could hope that a really\ngood card shows up in The Flop because Atlanta has\ndirect flights to Key West. That would be the real way that we would be likeliest to win. I mean  really the only thing that can do it for them\nat this point is  in our minds at least  unless there's something\nthat we're missing  is them burning through challenges  get the dice roll card  and then\nget the two out of six chance of getting enough distance from that to the Key West flight. It's a big long shot. It's possible...\nbut it's a big long shot. This is us  I think. Hello. Hi. I love Pittsburgh. I never knew that\nPittsburgh was so pretty. Alright  should we learn what Ben and Adam\nhave been up to? Yes  we have received\na few videos from them. They've been busy. They've been\nvery busy doing challenges. We were on the flight. Oof  there are three. Three?! Oh no! Hey guys. I just got trapped in this\nPort-A-Potty with my drugs. Oh no. Okay  so they got\nan 800 mile flight to Florida. We're still in Connellsville. Connellsburg?\nWhat was that? Connellsville  Pennsylvania. We've popped\nmany kernels of corn. Yes  many—\nWhat? Okay. Still in Connellsville \nfound our name in graffiti. Good bye! (giggles) Jesus Christ. Alright. Well  the only\nconcerning thing there is their 800 mile flight\nto anywhere but Florida  but we already looked at that. And the only useful flight\nout of there anytime soon was one to Atlanta  Georgia. So it would still be involved  somewhat involved for\nthem to get to that. Thank you so much.\nThank you so much. You have a good day. Yes  yes  thank you.\nWe appreciate you. Okay  welcome to\nAlright  alright  alright. the Pittsburgh\nInternational Airport. Right now it says that\nthere is only one ticket left on this 1 pm to Atlanta \nso you know what time it is. Time to beg. American.\nIt's time to... go to the ticket counter\nand beg. Let's go. We're doing\nthe strangest thing. We're in a race across America. We're trying to get a ticket\non the 1 pm to Atlanta  but it only shows\none ticket available online. But I was wondering if\nit's possible that maybe... It's sold out. Totally sold out? It tells me\nthat I possibly have two first class tickets. Great. We'll do that.\nI'll try it. Fantastic. Let's see if it will let me do it. It's not letting me... (sighs heavily) Buc-ee's! Buc-ee's!\nBuc-ee's! Michelle  we need to stop.\nDo we go? Should I pull over? Yes  pull over.\nThis is more important. (wheezes) Seriously? Yes. No  no  no.\nWe're on such a— No? Okay  I'm changing lanes.\nThat was a test  Michelle. Oh my god. And you fail. What the hell are you—\nD'what—? Oh my god. I love Buc-ee's. It is the promised land  but... (giggles)\nWe have more important things. And that's a rare thing\nto say about Buc-ee's but  we have more\nimportant things to do. Are you sure\nwe can't go  Sam? I was so excited to go. I know. Gotta get to the airport though.\nUgh. Business only. Goodbye  Alabama. ♪ Georgia ♪ Hello  Georgia. Famously home to Atlanta Hartsfield–Jackson\nInternational Airport. And peaches! But more importantly \nthe airport. Yeah. Well  let me\nask you a question. If we got booked on\nthe later flight  could you put us on standby\nfor the earlier flight? I could  but\nI couldn't guarantee that that's going to happen. What do you\nthink the odds are? So right now\nthere's two people on standby. Already? And zero flights. And they would get on\nahead of you because they have status\nwith Delta. Okay. So our odds would be bad. Yeah  most\npeople show up for Atlanta. Okay. Well  we'll try it. Because I don't know\nif you can be put— 'cause it leaves at 1:00. Yeah. It starts boarding at\n40 minutes before departure. Yeah  we're glad to run. I'm just going\nto hurry up and do it. Before it tells me I can't. Okay  I was able to get\nyou guys on standby for it. Thank you so much.\nThank you. This is not going to work. Nope. The people at the gate have been pretty clear that they think there's\nabout a zero chance that we get off of standby. We're gonna try it though. But we're certainly gonna try. Alright  we have about\nfive minutes left to the airport. Ooh  we're so close! Good news is  seats are\nstill available on the flight. Yes! Let's go! We're now basically\nat the boarding time for if Ben and Adam were taking\nthat flight down to Atlanta. I'm still...\nThe silence still has me. I'm so worried. The silence could either be very bad news\nor very good news. Right  right.\nNowhere in between. So Ben was turned back\nat security. No idea what that's about. Okay  TSA just rejected me because they don't see the flight  so I have to go back. Hi... they said that\nthey didn't see the flight. What flight? That we were just booked on. I don't know.\nThey sent me back with this. But you have\na boarding pass. I know. 276. Sure is a lot of people. Take the 4:00 flight. Use the 4:00 flight. Great  thank you. I'm gonna go down with you! Okay  okay  thank you. I was just rejected. They said they\ncouldn't see my flight. Alright  let me see your ID. Did you change your flight? No.\nHe's on standby for one flight. He has a confirmed flight. We've arrived. Okay. Let's give it a shot. Come on  come on  come on. Come on. It's really taking its time. Oh my goodness  come on! It's good. You're good. Thank you so much. Have a good one.\nThank you. Loading... There we go. Nice.\nIs it booked? Yes. We're going\nto Key West  baby! Nice. We just have to hope that Adam and Ben\nhaven't found a way to weasel themselves onto\nthis Key West flight. This is so stressful. I feel like there\nmust be something. I know! I'm so used to\nthem being able to nab it out from under me. Hi  I'm on standby. I just didn't know if I needed\nto check in or anything. Chase? I just got put on.\nI just called you up. Uh-huh  there you go  16B. Oh  I can get on? Yeah  in 30 minutes.\nOh  incredible. Fantastic. My friend is\non his way  Doyle. Okay! When he comes up  I'll just\nhave to have his seat assigned. Okay  great  thank you. Hi  at this time  I'd like to\nwelcome aboard Main 2. Main cabin 2. We're on the flight  Benjamin. Ohoho.\nOkay  we're still in it. They thought it was\nnever gonna happen. The people at the gate\nsimply did not believe in us. Okay.\nMuch like the audience  the people at the gate\ncounted the boys out. It turns out there's no\nsuch thing as sold out flights. You just get on. Simply get on standby.\nSimply get on standby. Just leave 'em at the\nbottom of this thing. Thank you. (chitters excitedly) Nearly there. We're nearly there. Just have to hope this\nflight isn't delayed. Yeah. And that Ben and Adam\ndon't snap and get on it. And that Ben and\nAdam don't sneak onto it. Gosh  I keep\nchecking behind me like  \"Where are they?\nThey're hiding somewhere.\" Their flight  if they got\non that flight from Pittsburgh  they should have just landed here. Alright. Hello  welcome to Atlanta. So we have booked to Sarasota. It's almost exactly 450 miles. It's like 446 or something. And you know what?\nAmidst all this chaos  I am very happy\nI think that's pretty good. to have tickets on that flight. So  the better option ...would be if\nwe can fish for a ticket that would allow us to fly\ndirectly to Key West. 'Cause there are flights direct\nfrom Atlanta to Key West. And then that's it. And then that would be it. I think we can for sure\ndo the paper airplane thing. Paper airplane\nwithout a doubt. I still  we still don't know\nwhere Sam and Michelle are. Have not heard from\nthem all day. I mean  I have to\nimagine that if we are facing all of this chaos\nand all of these delays and all of these\nfull flights and everything... They are too.\nIt's probably hitting them  too. What's your stress level? My stress level is\nextremely high as always. So nothing to report there. But not higher than average? It is higher than average. It always is.\nOh  okay  good  great. Especially...\nIt makes sense. My average is constantly\nincreasing this week. Okay  that  okay  got it. Yeah  that seems about right. Let's give it a go. Okay  Adam \nif you can hit that wall... Yeah  then that's a guarantee. Okay  give it a throw. It seems like\nwe should be okay. But they have always\npulled a fast one. Yep.\nConsistently. 'Cause we think they're here. I won't believe it until\nmy hand is on the finish line. Yes  agreed. Easy. Easy. Alright  let's give 'em a ring. I want to know\nwhere they are so bad  but I think they're\ngoing to hide. They're always trying to hide. If they don't pick up  we know that they're\nflying somewhere probably. This is so exciting. This is so exciting. Alright Ben \nlet's update The Flop. Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben. Is it the dice roll? Two.\nTwo  two  two. Oh  oh. Variable distance flight. Build a giant die. The die must be at least\n1 ft by 1 ft by 1 ft. You may not use a\npre-existing cube. Once the die is built \nyou must randomly allocate numbers 1 through 6\nto its sides and roll it. Multiply the number\nyou roll by 150 miles to get the distance\nof your flight. Okay  update— Yup  yup  yup  yup  yup. This could be it. This could be it  baby. Let's go back this way. This could be\nthe whole shebang. This could be\nthe whole shebang. —g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g— We think... We think these. Yeah  and with three of them  'cause they would fold open. So our plan is to\nadhere them with stickers. I think that will work. Have a good one. Let's just go to  yeah \nlet's just go to a gate. We will keep these records. They will not go to waste. I actually feel\nlike this is going to be a completely competent die. Yeah  that's actually\neven better than I expected. We are on the plane  and I have\nan entire row to myself. I hope these aren't\nAdam and Ben seats that they got on this plane...! I mean  I'm actually\nextremely proud of that. This side is four. This side is one. Five  two  three. And that makes this side six. Let's set the stakes. Yeah.\nIf we roll a five or a six... we can go straight to Key West. (sighs heavily) (whispering)\nDid they book these seats? Literally every other seat\nis filled. Except for these. Oh my god. Are you ready? I now don't know\nwhat side it is. I'm now gonna do a whole thing. Okay  and now \nhere we go. Ready? Give it  make sure it\ngets a nice spin on there. (sighs) That's a three. (bleep) That... That's not what we needed. No  that is not what we needed. Welcome to Key West. We're in Key West! Here. Let's get to the southernmost point. It is beautiful here. The ocean's right there. Oh  look what we got. Oh  hell yeah! Thank you. Have you ever been to Sarasota? (scoffs) No. I don't know  maybe. Maybe you've been to Sarasota. Why would I have been\nto Sarasota? I have never been to Sarasota \nfor what it's worth. That's it up there. (gasps) You can see it?! Yep. I can't 'cause\nI'm shorter than you. Look  it's the southernmost\nbar in the continental US. I guess we didn't acknowledge that this is only the\nsouthernmost point in the continental US.\n(chitters) Go! There it is! I have visualized this moment\nevery day for the past month. Here  watch out.\nPeople are taking photos. Here  just  just go\ntouch it really quickly. Quick touch. Great job. Let's get outta here.\nWe did it! We did it  Sam! Nice job. We did it! We don't want to get in\nall those nice people's photos. I know  we definitely\njust skipped the line of all the people waiting\nto take a picture with it. Let's go over here\nand FaceTime them. Okay. Hello  Michelle. Hello. Where are you? We have an update for y'all. We have something\nto show you. Key West  baby! Nooo! How? How? We drove through Utah to a random high-altitude airport\nand flew to Dallas from there the whole time you guys thought\nwe were in Colorado Springs. We took a flight\nusing our random card. The random card. To Birmingham  Alabama \ndrove to Atlanta  then used our neighboring state\ncard to go Atlanta to here. Congratulations  folks. Well done. That was a game well played. Thank you. You guys were\nsuch incredible opponents. You are certified professional\nathletes by my standards. I don't know how you guys\ndo this all the time. It was incredible. See you in a bit.\nHave fun in Key West. Bye. Bye. High-five. Sam! Sam's smiling! Show yourself smil—\nNo  he always— Let's find a\ngood spot to post up. And then hear back from them\nwhen they get to Sarasota. Should we\nget a piña colada? Potentially.\nYes! Hello! Well  Adam  we are not\ngoing to Sarasota after all. We asked really nice \nand they let us off the plane. They did let us\nget off the plane. Ready? Yep. You gotta get your\npiña colada. Hello!\nAlright. Sam  Michelle. But mostly Michelle. Mostly Michelle. I'm sure that it was\n90% Michelle  to be honest. Congratulations on winning season 8 of\nJet Lag: The Game. A very  very\nspectacular performance. Wooo! Now  I know that you\nprobably think that you've bested us \nthat you've outsmarted us  that you have\nthrown us for a loop. But in fact... nothing could be\nfurther from the truth. To that we say  ha! We knew that this is\nexactly what would happen. Which is why we stored\nthe season 8 trophy in this garbage can at\nthe Atlanta Airport. Now  you're not going\nto believe this  but... Whooaa! There it goes! Woah! Woah! It floated out of the can \nand now it's flying to Key West!\nWoah! Woah! Oh  do you see it?\nYeah  yeah. Do you see it  Sam?\nYeah. It's right there! Oh my gosh \nit's coming so fast! It's coming  so I have to\nput my drink down. Well  it's coming\nspecifically to right here. Oh my god  you got it. Ready? Yay! That's great. Okay. Oh  we have to put it down. We just dropped it. Just throw it over there. Okay. Now  Michelle \nI'm sure that it was... It was a tremendous feeling. But are you feeling anything\nelse at this moment? Um... I guess I'm feeling... jet lagged! She said the thing!\n(giggles) Yeaaah!\nWoooaaaahhh! Waaaah! See you in season nine! See you in season nine! Woo! Hello! This is where I'm hiding. Good luck finding me here...! They just passed me again. It's all in the trees. This is hell.\nWe're living in hell. Sam  is this right? We gotta hurry\njust a little bit. How did they guess here? They were this close. Getting pretty close. So close  but so far  boys. Wait  wait  I've always\nwanted to do this. I've always wanted\nto do the thing... Sam's been here. You know  like detectives do.\nOh  sure  okay  yeah. Okay  great. Let's find him. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus We cannot wait to bring you\nJet Lag: Switzerland. It is such a fun season. I mean  it's got mountains. It's got trains. Your two favorite things. What else do you need? You need jet laggers.\nIn there. And that's what happened. Yeah.\nAnd it's a lot of fun. The game is a lot of fun. I mean  I guess it's\nthe first time we've been to Europe with\nanything but tag. It's true. And Europe is a great\nspot to do games. And so it's really fun to have\ndone something different there. We're furiously in\npost-production right now. We can't wait to bring it to you. But  the good news is \nif you wanna see it a little bit earlier \nyou can on Nebula! Because every single episode\nof Jet Lag is out one week early on Nebula \nincluding the start to next season. And also  as a special treat\nfor Nebula subscribers  by popular demand  we have made a giant\ncompilation of clips from this season that we loved  but that did not make the\nfinal cut of the season. So that'd be bloopers  outtakes  a ton of bits that were somehow\ntoo dumb even for this show. The video of outtakes is\nactually a full 26 minutes long  which if you're counting  makes it longer than the\nfirst episode of this season. So hopefully it will help to\ntide you through the off-season. But that video is available\nexclusively on Nebula. We will not be putting\nit on YouTube. It is a special thanks\nto our Nebula subscribers for helping support the show. And don't forget \nwe will still be doing our Nebula-exclusive\npodcast  The Layover through the off-season. So there is plenty of\nbonus Jet Lag content to keep you going\nthrough the off-season  but it is only available on Nebula. And  but there's\nalso a lot of other great exclusive stuff on Nebula. Yeah  I mean  Nebula's\ngot plenty of other stuff to keep you occupied\nduring the off-season. You've got amazing\noriginal content from channels like RealLifeLore  who you've seen on this show. Real Engineering  who you've\nalso seen on this show. You've got Broey Deschanel \nAnita Sarkeesian. You've got Lindsay Ellis. I heard there's this channel\ncalled Wendover Productions. Sounds like it's for\nfreakin' nerds  actually. But that's a lot of channels. That's a lot of original \nexclusive content. And I heard somewhere\nthat  you know  there's the biggest ever slate of\nOriginals coming out right now. So there's more stuff than ever\ngoing out on Nebula. New stuff almost\nevery week or so. You know  all original stuff \nand it's really good stuff because it's independent\ncreators doing unique stuff that you know  can't  you\ncan't really do on YouTube  and you can't really\ndo for Netflix or big broadcasters or whatever.\nI don't know. If you go to nebula.tv/jetlag \nyou can get 40% off which brings it down\nto just like $30 a year  which breaks down to\nunder $3 a month-ish. Yeah?\nYeah. Exactly. Definitely. Which is not that much.\n$2.50 a month actually. Especially to watch\nall this exclusive content  Layover podcast  early Nebula  and help support the show. That's literally how we get\nthe money to do the show. But yeah  see you\nin season nine!"

        "transcript": "We're back in\nCharleville  France. We're playing\nTag Across Europe. But that bell means it's 6 am \nand Ben's the runner  so he's gotta go \ngo  go  go  go  go! Go  Ben!\nGo  Ben! Alright  here we go! We're doing tag again. This time \nI'm off to Switzerland. Good luck  Ben! Alright  well\nwe got 45 minutes. So I guess we gotta plan\nhow to catch him. Alright  so here's\nhow the game works. We're here in\nCharleville-Mézières  France  because it's the\napproximate midpoint between these three\nlocations in Europe. In this game  Ben is\ntrying to get here to Zermatt  Switzerland  Adam is trying to get\nhere to Borkum  Germany  and I  Sam am trying to\nget here to Jersey  UK. Right now  Ben's the Runner. While you're the Runner  you can move towards\nyour location. If you can make it\nall the way there  you win the game immediately. But if no one makes\nit to their location  the win goes to\nwhoever's location is closest to the Runner\nat the end of 72 hours  which you can see by\nlooking at these win areas. While the Runner heads\nfor their location  the other two players will\nact as \"it\"  aka Chasers. They'll have a\nlive tracker on the Runner and work together to tag them. Once the Runner is tagged \ntheir positions rotate. The Runner becomes a Chaser  and the next Chaser\nbecomes the Runner. So now  back to Ben who needs to\ncome up with a plan to get outta\nCharleville-Mézières before we can come after him. Okay. Looking at the timetables\nfor this morning  there's at least one train that leaves before they're out of\ntheir freeze period. And that is to Reims  Champagne-Ardenne Station\nin Reims. That's in about a half an hour. I love that the\nwhole town is set up as a beach for\nsome reason  again. Sam  I think that we should\nfilm our strategy discussion with our heads in that thing. So Adam  I think\nthe first thing is we have to figure out\nwhich train he's on. Yeah  I mean \nI know that there is a train this morning that goes to Champagne-Ardenne. My guess is that\nhe'll go on that. 'Cause the only other train\nthis morning goes north. And I don't think\nhe'll wanna take that. Yeah  okay. But let's\nlook at where he is. ♪ We're back at the\nCharleville station ♪ ♪ And we're gonna get\na little brekkie ♪ Ooh  can I get brekkie\nat this... vending machine? It worked. (clattering)\nOh... Oh  oh  I think my\nhand is trapped. Okay  so... I don't even know if\nBen will figure this out  because it doesn't\nactually go to the stop that he's going to \nbut there's a very high-speed train\n– a TGV – that stops at Reims  which is one— just right\nnext to Champagne-Ardenne  where he will get. And we could just take a taxi\nfrom Reims to Champagne-Ardenne. That'd be very quick. I don't think\nhe'll think of that  if I'm being honest. He's gotten more experienced. He's got a big brain. He went to Brown. Oh. Okay  we got it. Now I'm also gonna get a\nlittle bottle of water. (British accent)\nBoh-ohl of wa-aah. That's the thing\nabout this season  is we're all going into this with a whole season of\nfailures under our belt. That's true.\nThat we've learned from. (bottle drops) (flap opens  clatters) Oh my hand's trapped again. Ah! (bottle crinkling) Oh  it's a (bleep)\ndeath trap  okay. That's me. Off to Reims. It's almost time.\nYeah. We have one more minute\n'til we can go after Ben. Although this time \nwe don't have to run  because our train\nYeah  we have plenty of time. Doesn't leave\nfor a half hour. And also you can't run. Yes. For old time's sake  I think we should run\nfor five seconds  just for the vibes. It's 6:45. (bells ringing) Let's do it! Let's do\nour running for vibes! Vibe run! Okay  now let's walk. We're on the\nway to the station. Are you\nchasing someone or...? Maybe. Well  I think that\nif you know the format  we have to admit that\nwe are chasing someone. Okay  it's 6:45. That means the chasers\nhave been released. And they're after me. And you know... Last time  I was scared. This time... I'm making it\nall the way  baby. There's not gonna be a single\ntag in this game of tag. We're gonna have to call it\nsomething different than tag. We're gonna have to call it... Wait  wait. The TGV's a half hour late? Yes. Uh-oh. That might change our plan. Oh goodness. Okay  well thank you\nfor this update  Sophie. We maybe should take the\nslow regional train then. Yeah  yeah. (sigh) Unfortunate. This means probably\nBen never realized we could get there\nthe faster way. And we're doing what he thinks. 'Cause he's just\nnavigating on vibes. Right. Okay  so I am on\nthis train for 58 minutes. And in order to move in\nthis game as a Runner  you have to pay for all of\nyour transportation with coins. So real quick \nwhile you're the Runner  you have to pay for all your\ntransportation using coins. Other than running \nyou can take trains  metros  planes \nferries  or bikes. Each form of transportation\ncosts a different amount  and is paid for by the minute. Every player starts\nwith 2 000 coins which isn't enough\nto get them very far. If they want to earn more \nthey have to pull a randomly selected card\nfrom the challenge deck. If they complete the challenge \nthey earn the reward. But if they fail to \nor choose to veto it  they can only walk or run\nfor the next 30 minutes. And this train is\ngonna cost me 580 coins  because it's 58 minutes\non low-speed rail. I'm gonna have\nan hour in Champagne before Sam and Adam\ncould show up. So I'm gonna try and pull\na card when I get there and knock out a challenge  earn some more coins\nbefore I keep moving. And hopefully I don't get screwed. That's the plan. I mean  delayed\nby a half hour. That's a long delay. That's tough stuff  yeah. Alright  Sam \nwhile we wait around... This is probably a bad idea\nand will cost a lot of money  but I want you to suggest a strange and exciting\nmotion graphic that we are gonna put\nin the video right now. I would like to see... Bowser. Bowser?\nBowser. From like Mario? Yeah. Do we have\nthe rights to that? No  no  actually no. Mayor Muriel Bowser\nof Washington  DC. (wheezes)\nOkay  okay. Sorry. Change of plans. Mayor Muriel Bowser\nof Washington  DC... with laser eyes. Okay. In the middle\nof the bandstand. Great.\nBasically... destroying the bandstand. Okay  I think\nthat'd be good. Yeah. Okay  now react to it. Now react to\nhow crazy it looks. Mayor Muriel Bowser? This is not what I voted for. Alright  let's go. Let's go wait in the station. Platform two. Platform two  alright. Platform two. Hello  friend. Choo-choo. By the way  confirmed. Ben has passed (with cough) Reims\ndowntown station. So he is going— So he's almost certainly\ngoing to Champagne-Ardenne. Alright. Hello and welcome to the beautiful\nvineyards of Champagne. I was looking at\nsome train schedules  and I'm pretty sure... And I could be wrong\n– I'm often wrong – but I'm pretty sure that Sam and Adam cannot\nget here until 8:48. So... I need to get on a train\nout of here before 8:48 is the idea. Fortunately  it seems like\nthere's a couple of good options. There's a train to Nancy  and there's a train\nto Strasbourg. And both of those are... basically in the right direction  so I think they're both perfect. But I don't have enough\nto take either of them  at least all the way. So  that means it's time to pull the first card\nof this season. And hopefully  it is fine. First card. Do a taste test. Acquire a bag of\nHaribo Gold Bears. Close your eyes. Taste three gold bears\nand guess their flavors. You must get all three correct. If you do not succeed  you must wait 10 minutes\nbefore trying again. You may practice. I am good... at tasting candy. The only question is  can I get\nHaribo Gold Bears here? (strained grunting) Ben has officially\narrived at his first stop  Champagne-Ardenne station. And that is where he can transfer to a TGV\nto Strasbourg. Right.\nIn not very long from now. If he gets on the\nnext train to Strasbourg  our only option is\njust to follow him on the train that's\nan hour later. Yeah. Whatever.\nWhich is... I mean it's fine  but... Just doesn't\nget us any closer. We continue\nto be behind him. Yeah. That's not great. So  yeah. So we just have to hope\nthat his challenges go badly. Okay  there's\na vending machine. There's some Haribo \nbut not... Not the bears. (bleep) Ugh. Says there's another Relay a quarter mile from here. Maybe they'll have Gold Bears. Ohh. Now here—\nBut here's the thing. He is gonna have to earn\njust over 1 000 coins to get on that train. Yeah  and then— There's not a lot around him. This station is kind of\non the edge of the city. Yeah  so I don't know. Could be tough. The (bleep)? What are all these buildings? What is Yanmar? That's not a Relay. It says I'm at the Relay. It doesn't exist. Okay. Yeah  this is a construction\nequipment building. Okay. That's okay. We're going... back to\nthe train station. We can't complete\nthis challenge here. But  I can get on\nanother train. It looks like Ben is\ngoing back to the station? He was outta the station  and it's now showing\nhim back in the station. Are there other trains? Let's just look at \nI don't know. Nope  the next train is\nthe one to Strasbourg. Okay  well... So... he's either on that\nor not on any train. Let's hope he's not\non any train. We can hope. Okay  here's the dealio. So I could not earn enough to\ngo all the way to Strasbourg  but what I can do and what I'm gonna do is I can get on the\ntrain to Strasbourg  but not go all the way there. I can get off a stop... called Lorraine \nand go to Lorraine. Which is still\ngoing the right way. And then... do... some challenges in Lorraine and keep going from there. I don't know how much time\nthat will buy me. But I think that this... is my best option right now. So that's what I'm gonna do. That's me. Okay  here we go. His circle is moving. We're not... He's definitely on\nthe way to Strasbourg. Oh god. I can't believe we let him\nget all the way to Germany. Well  there was\nliterally nothing we could do. Well  yeah  I mean \nI guess I would say I can't believe that the failure of the\nFrench train system let him get all\nthe way to Germany. True. Alright  welcome back\nto Champagne-Ardenne. One funny thing is\nthat I didn't pack layers  'cause I just thought the odds we would specifically\nend up in Zermatt were so low. But now... Not only would\nwe end up in Zermatt. I think our\nfinish location— It's on top of a mountain. Well  we just have to\nhang out here until... the next train comes. It's already\nbeen three hours. Yeah. Three hours\nwithout catching Ben. I would say that things\nare not going great. It's three hours \nand the earliest possible we could catch him\nis two hours from now. Yeah. Theoretically  he— There is one intermediate\nstop that he could make. Nah  I doubt it. It would be an\ninteresting move. Maybe if he didn't have... the budget or something  and well  he's getting to\nthat intermediate stop now. (chimes) (door slides open) Alright \nwelcome to Lorraine. So I only have 470 coins. So  I gotta find some\ngummy bears fast  before I can get on\nanother train. So let's look for\ngummy bears. I'm just saying... I feel like France... Okay.\nThis is a problem. I feel like 60 years ago— We completely missed\nthe pizza vending machine. There's a pizza—\nOh my god. I want that.\nDo we have time? We have 15 minutes. Sacrée Pizza. Says 3–4 minutes. Three to four?\nThat's what it says. Oh  great. (gasp) That's what\nI'm talking about. Bonjour.\nBonjour. It is fortunate\nthat this train station had Gold Bears  because— I just wanna pop\noutside for a second. There is nothing... else for miles. It's just fields. It's literally just fields. Wait  Sam \nit's about to come out! It's about to pop out!\nMoo! Sam  you have to\nfilm it coming out. I know that's a sheep. (both moaning) Ohohoho! It's hot  it's so hot. Thank you  vending\nmachine pizza man. Wow  that is surprisingly cooked. Okay. Okay  hi. We're here in Lorraine \nbeautiful Lorraine. And we're gonna do a taste test. Closing my eyes  here's the bear. You now know what flavor it is. I don't. It's citrusy. I think it's either\nlemon or orange. I'm going with lemon.\nGoing with lemon. Now I'm gonna check. Platform three. There's sort of\nlike a little tear. I wonder if I can\nsort of tear the pizza. Our train is here.\nNo  that didn't work. Our train's here. Oh yeah. Okay  I got that one right. So we're on to number two. We're gonna close our eyes. Here's the bear. It tastes exactly the same. I think it's also lemon. Okay  right again. If I get this last bear \nI win the challenge. Here's our last bear. Apple. It's apple. I'm gonna check  but\nI'm 100% sure I'm right. Okay  I got that one right. That means... the 800 coins are mine. The question is \nwhat am I gonna do with them? Because I need to\nget out of here... before Sam and Adam\ncan get to me. Okay. There's one train\nthat leaves from here before the train that I\nassume they're on gets here. And that... goes... back right the way\nthat I came. It stops in Meuse. I could go there. I think their train also\nstops in Meuse  but... They might not think\nto get off there. Yeah  I mean  I think I\nhave to get on that train. Because the next train\nthat's getting here is the one that I really\nthink that they're on. So  I think I'm gonna\ngo back to Meuse. I hope I'm\npronouncing that right. They might not even—\nI mean  look. They might not\neven be on that train that I think that they're on. This whole thing might\nbe really stupid  but... (sigh) You know what? They won't expect me\nto go to Meuse. And I'm not like\nother boys  you know? I go to Meuse. Alright  alright. Getting off here in Meuse. They're either here\nor they're not. Alright  let's go.\nLet's go  let's go. Yes  we gotta get to the\nother side of the station. Do you want me to run ahead? Yeah. Okay  here  take the pizza. Okay. Don't get stuck on the train. I don't see them. This is a real small station. You're tagged  buddy. What happened?\nYou ran outta coins? It was a gamble.\nIt was a gamble. I was doing a little gamble. Whew. Yeah  I was hoping you\nguys were gonna get on it. Oh... well why\ndidn't you hide? I recognize this guy. I tagged him. Alright  give me\nthe cards right now. Okay  Adam... Wait. Gimme the cards right now. There you go. Good bye.\nBye. Good luck. I wonder what train\nhe's getting on. Well  he's probably trying\nto get back on our— Oh  he already has a ticket on our train on\nthe other platform. Excuse me. I would propose we\nstart doing some research about various things\nthat he will do. Let's figure it out.\nI mean— I mean we can safely\nassume that he's probably going to\nStrasbourg right now. There's a small chance he gets\noff of the station before  but I think Strasbourg\ncertainly makes sense  and he has the budget\nto get there  I believe. I mean  I was just— Yeah  he can definitely\nget to Strasbourg  and the station before it \nas I just discovered  is nothing. You forget something? No  no  it's\nvery hard to explain. We're playing a game. Yeah? So I just caught my friend. Okay. So now I'm back on\nhere going to Strasbourg. Okay  and your friend? He has to stay\nhere for a while. It says that there's not\nanother one to Strasbourg... until 1:30. No.\nThat can't be right. Eh? No  no. No. Hold on though. Oh  no.\nNo  no  no  no  no. We can kind of\ngo back to Paris. Well...

        "transcript": "Hello and\nwelcome to episode two of this game of\nTag Across Europe. Just as a quick refresher \nin this game  we're each trying to get to\na different place in Europe. Whichever of us is\nthe current Runner can spend coins to make\nprogress towards their location  while trying to avoid\ncapture from the Chasers. Last episode  on his way\nto Zermatt  Switzerland  Ben ended up getting\ncaught in Meuse  a station in the middle\nof absolutely nowhere. This made Adam the Runner and gave him a\nmassive opportunity. Using the reservation\nhe had made as a Chaser  he was able to get\nright back on the train he took in Meuse before\nit left the station. That train is headed\nto Strasbourg  from which Adam could head\nnorth towards Germany  to his location  Borkum. And to make matters\nworse for me and Ben  who now need to catch Adam  the next train from\nMeuse to Strasbourg isn't for three hours. Putting us\ndangerously far behind. Adam has just been gifted... the biggest lead\nthis game has ever had. Well  why did\nyou catch me here? Why did you go here?! At the last station... That way... There was a train\none hour later to Strasbourg. But it doesn't stop here. But it doesn't stop here. Yeah  only half\nthe trains stop here. Look around! Okay so... I've dipped into the\nlittle area between cars to explain the move. Basically  I'm back on the train that Sam and I were\njust on to Strasbourg. I'm allowed to do that 'cause we initially booked a\nreservation to Strasbourg. So I have to pay for it now  but I'm allowed to get on it. I have a reservation. The thing is... they can't get to\nStrasbourg for— Three hours ahead. But only theoretically\nthree hours ahead. What  you banking\non a derailment? Well... we could call in a bomb threat. I just walked through\na car that was all children. Surely the children are\nnot traveling alone  all of them together  right? Comment below if children\nhave a special car or if that's just a band of... very transit-oriented children. Okay  hello. So we have done some research. We thought we were\nextremely screwed. But it turns out we're\nonly very screwed. Two thirds of\nextremely screwed. I mean  we looked\nat every option. We've just spent\n40 minutes researching. We wanted to see if we could\nbasically cut Adam off. We looked at flights.\nWe looked at trains. We looked at everything. And there's no way to really get\nahead of him on his route north. So we have to just\nfollow him basically. And hope he loses time. Well  fortunately  turns out  if we go backwards \nback to Champagne-Ardenne... then we can take a slightly\nearlier train to Strasbourg and only be what \ntwo hours behind? It's better. Better. There's our train. That seems bad. (door clatters open) It seems bad. Au revoir  mon ami. Enjoy your trip at\nStrasbourg. Alright \nwelcome to Strasbourg. I'm just gonna get\noutside the train station  and then I'll explain\nmy full plan. ♪ (upbeat folk music) That music is fun. Let's just get across\nthe street here. Oh  it's already\nstarting to get hot. Well  it's gotten toasty. It got toasty. Sam  would you believe that Adam Chase is in\nStrasbourg  France  right now? I think I would believe \nI guess actually. Well  that's the case. That he's there. We should try and\nfigure out what... 12:46. 12:46?\n12:46. That's his best\ntrain outta there? Yeah  so it is\na bit of a walking. I mean  he's gonna rack up\nsome coins  no doubt. Yeah. Alright  so\nhere's the deal. The goal is to get to Borkum. But it's very far. So I'm not totally\ngonna focus on getting all the way up just yet. I'm more focused on\ngetting to Münster. And I need to get on\nthat train at 12:46. So in about an hour and a half. To get to Münster  I need... I did the math on it. 3 820 coins. I have 550 right now. So basically I have\nan hour and a half to earn just over 3 000 coins. Which... doable  not super easy. So I think that\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm going to buy the 250 coin powerup that doubles the value\nof my next challenge  but it also doubles\nthe veto period. So it would be very\nbad if I had to veto. Let's find out. Shuffle  shuffle. Congratulations  you're in\nAmy's Trivia Corner! Amy has recorded three\ntrivia questions about Europe with increasing\nlevels of difficulty. You have one guess\nat each answer. For each right answer \nyou receive 400 coins. There is no punishment\nfor wrong answers in Amy's Trivia Corner. That's not how Amy rolls. This... rocks! Oh my gosh  this is amazing. This is the best card\nin the deck. I am thrilled to be\nin Amy's Trivia Corner because there is\nno veto for this card. Alright. Let's see what's in store... in Amy's Trivia Corner. Oh  by the way \nif you didn't know  Amy is our colleague. She writes a lot of\nHalf as Interesting videos and sometimes helps\nus with Jet Lag. Okay. Welcome to\nAmy's Trivia Corner. Here is your first question. In 1911  a European painting\nwas iconically stolen. So iconically that when\nthe museum got it back years later...\nIt's the Mona Lisa. It was way more famous\nthan it had ever been. It's Mona Lisa.\nI know this. So now if\nyou wanna see it  you're gonna have to\nbrave some serious crowds. What painting was that?\nYeah  it's the Mona Lisa. I know this. It's the Mona Lisa. It was the Mona Lisa.\nIt is the Mona Lisa. Thank you Amy. Okay  awesome. So that right away  800 coins. Second question. Do you want some pizza? Pizza?\nYeah. Sure. They have pizza here? Boy  do I have\nsome news for you. Oh my god. Oh. That's— Ow. (giggles)\n(bleep) I was so excited about this. (sigh) This rocks.\nSecond question. The German\nlanguage is full of tons of very useful \nvery specific words. Wanderlust  schadenfreude \nTorschlusspanik. Which of these is the\ndefinition of Torschlusspanik? A) fear of looking\nlike a tourist. B) realizing you left home\nwithout turning the lights off. C) anxiety caused by\nrunning out of time. Or D) a school or class that prepares children\nfor the first grade? Oh no. Oh  I don't know this at all. Torschlusspanik. Okay  'panik'  yeah. So sounding out \n'panik' would be anxiety. So I don't think it's D. But 'torsch' sounds\na lot like torch  and that would lead me to\nthink it's about lights. So I feel like it's B. I'm going B.\nI'm going B. I would really like\nit to be B  please. So the answer is C. No! Anxiety caused\nby running out of time. No! You wouldn't know\nanything about that would you? This sucks! It's fine  it's fine  it's fine. It's fine  it's fine.\nLast question. Europe is a continent\nof many distinct flags. Which of these four flags\nis not the real flag of a European country? Oh god. Oh Jesus. One of them is Italy's. I know that for sure. Oh god. Okay  I think that B\nis the Italian flag. D looks kind of familiar. It's between\nA and C for me. I'm going A  but I\ndon't feel confident. The answer is A. Yes! Obviously  that—\nLook at it. It's ridiculous. Couldn't possibly be real. Oh my god \nokay  incredible. So that is 1 600 coins\nright there. It's half of what I need. (sigh) Thank you  Amy. Who needs human beings? They suck.\nThey suck. I wish I could install\none of those in my apartment. Welcome back to this episode\nof Choo Choo Chew: Derailed. Yeah  I don't like\nthat you have completely co-opted\nthe Snack Empire that we built. And you didn't.\nThis is Snack Zone now. No  I said no. Okay  well that\nturned out amazing. So I feel like it's probably\nno longer worth the risk to double up again? I don't know. No  no.\nI'm gonna double up. I'm gonna double up again. I'm trying to earn\ncoins right now. Focusing on coins. Shuffle  shuffle. Cut an orange in\nhalf using only this card. Acquire an orange. Using only this card \nfully cut the orange in half. You cannot pry the orange open using your hands or the card. (exhales slowly) Okay. Okay. Okay  we have tested this. It is doable. It is not exactly easy. Because basically the\namount of time it takes to cut the orange is almost the exact\nsame amount of time that it takes to completely\ndisintegrate the card. Let's go... find an orange. Let's go find a\ngoddamned orange. The supermarket? Yes. Ooh  this one's pretty soft. This one is—\nThis is a winner. Merci. Sorry excuse me.\nAre you Adam? Oh yeah  hey man.\nI'm a big fan. Hey  great\nto meet you  dude. I've seen all six seasons. What's your name?\nSid. Sid  good\nto meet you  dude. Alright  Sid  I... You can hang with me\nif you want. But while we hang  I have to cut an orange\nin half using only this card. But if you wanna sit down\nwith me while we do it. Okay  yeah \nI can sit down. You can totally chill. I think I need to start by\nfocusing on getting all the skin  and then I'll focus\non the flesh. Okay  okay. See if I can get— Okay  so we're already in \nso this feels good. Oh  but see  I just bent it. So we gotta be mad careful here. So I'm gonna take—\nI'm gonna just go— I'm gonna do one side at a time. And I cannot\nhelp you in any way. No  no  no  certainly not. But you can help me\nby chilling here. Yeah. Oh goodness. Sid  would you mind\nchecking to make sure that I'm in—\nthat we're in frame? Oh  yeah  we are.\nOkay  fantastic. Okay  okay  this was good. This was good.\nLook  look  look. Yeah? I've almost\ngot all of the... The skin. Yeah  yeah  almost\nall the skin  okay. I'm gonna try to make sure the camera can see\nwhat I'm doing. Okay  that feels huge. So we've got \nwe've cut all the skin. So now I think we just have\nto get through the middle. Yeah. And I think\nyou'll be— Oh  oh  this\nis feeling good. Yeah? This is feeling good. You got it.\nThis is feeling— Oh  I got close. But I did not\nquite get there. Okay. Here we go. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh  oh  okay. Okay  look  see? Here's the state of the game. The card is falling apart. We are so close on the orange. Almost there.\nOkay. I think a fold? Do you think?\nYeah  I think a fold. Because it's really\nmore about just pushing. Yeah.\nOh god. Oh  we're so close  okay.\nAlmost  almost. It's literally just this. Okay  I think maybe with this. Yes... Ha ha! You did it. There we go  alright. That is huge news. It's so great to meet you  Sid. Nice to meet ya.\nSee ya. Bye. (groans) What do you\nthink Adam's up to? You know what\nI bet he's not up to? Being chill? And eating a delightful\nvending machine pizza in the sun. Can I eat\nsome of this orange? Okay  so this is great. So I'm only\n670 coins short. So I think at this point  it is probably not\nworth it to double up. Because I sort of risk\ngetting (bleep)-ed. And I would prefer\nnot to get (bleep)-ed if that makes sense. Alright. Shuffle  shuffle. Fight them on the beaches. Send a menacing image\nto the Chasers from three of the\nfollowing locations: A beach (anywhere where\nnatural water meets land)  A landing ground (any spot\nwhere an aircraft lands)  a field  a street  a hill. Okay. Okay  sure  sure  sure  sure. Oh wait  (bleep) (wheezes) This puts me 70 coins\nshort of what I need. That's annoying. It's fine. It's fine  it's fine \nit's fine  okay. This is a reference to a\nWinston Churchill speech  if you didn't get that. But anyway  alright. Menacing image. Alright  I'm gonna\nmake them tell a story. I suggest checking\nyour SMS text messages. Oh  okay. Oh  oh  he's—\nUh-oh. He looks very menacing. Oh my god. I feel very menaced. He looks like\nhe's about to punch us. Do you think Adam's\never punched anyone? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. (rapping) ♪ Let's go\nto the beach  beach ♪ ♪ Let's go get away ♪ ♪ They say what they gonna say ♪ ♪ Have a drink  clink \nfound a Bud Light ♪ ♪ Bad (bleep) like me\nis hard to come by ♪ Ninki Minjaj. So the card defines\n'beach' very loosely. Anywhere where... natural water meets land. And now a field. This is beautiful. Ooh  I'm gonna go\nunder this cool bridge. Wheeee! Wheeee! This is for sure a field. 600 more coins  baby. This is going really well.\nHere we go. I feel like I'm\ndue for a hard one. Answer a riddle\nunder a bridge. Tristan has recorded a\nriddle for you to answer. You are permitted one guess. If you are wrong \nthis card is vetoed. You must answer the\nriddle beneath a bridge. Once beneath the bridge  you cannot leave until\nyou have attempted an answer. Okay. Well  I know how to\nget under a bridge. Alright  Tristan. Let's see what you got. Adam is... by a river. I wonder if he's doing a riddle. Under a bridge?\nMhm. I sure hope so. I feel bad that... Tristan keeps recording\nthese riddles for us. Hi! Alright  time for a riddle. Hi  Tristan. I tried to get under\na bridge in solidarity  but couldn't quite make it. But here we go. I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. And everywhere I go \ndarkness follows. Think about\nthat for a second. I hope you're having\na good Jet Lag  by the way. Oh  fisherman. Okay  I'm gonna read\nthe answer now. The answer is clouds. That's slightly concerning. There's a jet. It's like a military jet. I hope this is our\nlast stop here. Yeah. I can only take so\nmuch vending machine pizza. Well  you don't\nhave to get a vending machine pizza\nevery time. Yes  yes  you do  Ben. Now  Ben and I are finally\nheaded for Strasbourg  where Adam has been\ndoing challenges. With the riddle complete  Adam has earned enough to get\nhim all the way to Münster. He'll take a train to Offenburg  transfer onto a\ntrain to Karlsruhe  and then finally onto one long\nregional train to Münster. That first train to Offenburg\nleaves in 35 minutes  right before we\narrive in Strasbourg. But if he can earn another\n980 coins before he leaves  he'll have enough to get him\nall the way to his finish line without ever needing to\nstop for a challenge again. So... My train is in 35 minutes. I'm gonna pull one more card. 'Cause I still have\ntime to veto. Make a putt. Roll a ball into a cup\nfrom a distance of 10 feet. The cup may be no larger\nthan six inches in diameter. You may spend\nas long as you wish setting up items\nto aid its roll. You get one attempt. If you fail  the challenge\nis automatically vetoed. Ooh. This one is very funny\nto get in this circumstance. Alright  I have five minutes\nto do this attempt. Big cup. Okay. Yeah  it's the best\nwe're gonna do. Alright. Smooth surface. Where's gonna have a\nreally smooth surface? This is like cobblestone \nwhich I don't... I don't like that. Okay  these floors are smoother. I would need space. The idea of this card\nis that we figured you would most likely\nspend quite a while setting up your shot... 'cause you only get\none chance at it. I am in a position where I... just don't have time\nto do that  so... (sighs) I think we're just gonna have\nto kind of go for it here. (clatter) We are officially\ngoing to Germany. Alright  I believe... we have just passed\ninto Germany. Yes. This is Kehl. Welcome to Kehl. Welcome to the great\ncountry of Germany. A country that is good and\nother times has been bad before  but seems mostly good now. Sam  welcome to\nbeautiful Strasbourg. Welcome back.\nWelcome back. We've been here before. Yeah. In a similar situation. Hey  look  guns. Nice  you should definitely\nfilm the people with guns. We are not gonna\nbe here for long. We are going to go\nright to Frankfurt  to try and cut Adam off. We need... We're catching up. Reservations on that train. And the website is...\n(bleep) us. So  we have to go\ntalk to a real person. Which  neither\nof us like to do. Ah  real people suck. Okay. (moans) Now it filled\nup in the one minute. That's brutal. Okay. Team Bam has been\nvinced once again. Well  we tried to\ngo book a reservation on the next train to Frankfurt  and it was full. I mean  there's a\ntrain an hour later  but I would like to not\nlose a whole 'nother hour. Alright  pulling\ninto Offenburg. I'll have three minutes\nto make my connection? That shouldn't be\na problem at all. Deutsche Bahn is so reliable. Okay  okay. It leaves in three minutes. I legit might miss it. If I miss this train... it will throw my\nwhole plan off. What  I don't know\nwhat these signs mean. I just need to find\na departure board. Oh  come on  come on  come on. Platform three.\nOh  thank god. Okay  Google knew. Okay. I think it turned out it was\nactually just on the platform immediately opposite me... to start with. But that's fine. I am gonna make it\non the train. Lots of luck in your\nsenior year  boys. Well  we've looked\nat our options  and yeah. I think the consensus is 'cause that train was\nfully lost an hour. The best train is\nthe one at 2:51. Well  the best train is the one in 5–6 minutes  but... The best train that's\nnot full. Yes. You know what?\nI'm flipping the script. We're totally fine  Ben.\nWe're gonna crush it. We are gonna crush it.\nIn fact  we are crushing it. We are currently crushing\nit while sitting here. And everything is fine.\nAnd you know what? He has a whole—\n(stammers) He's got— Alright. Welcome to Karlsruhe. And folks  we are\non the same train for about\nfour and a half hours. It's a very good move for me. It's a very good move for me. So  you know... Sucks for you! You know what we need? Unsafe amounts of caffeine. So Ben has never in his\nlife had a Red Bull. So welcome to\nThe Snack Zone. This is a solicitation\nfor sponsorship. Okay.\nCheers. (can opening) Prost. Why does it taste like this? Adam  I hope you\nget hit by a train. (imitating dripping) It's a very\ndifferent shape. (indistinct)\nLove it. The man is in Mannheim. Looks like he  yeah. Looks like he's probably\ncontinuing past Mannheim. Well  we would have\nthis happen eventually. Yes  probably. I'm mostly  yeah  probably. Alright  so\nall this is Mannheim. What can we learn\nabout Mannheim? Okay. Mannheim is the\nsecond largest city in the German state\nof Baden-Württemberg after the state capital \nwhich is Stuttgart. It's Germany's 21st largest city. All that is pretty boring. Okay  we're making\na quick little transfer. Welcome to Germany  Sam. Choo-choo. I have news. What's the dealio  Sam? Adam has passed Frankfurt. He's passed Frankfurt? But... he is not on\nthe high-speed line. Interesting. He seems to be\non a regional line. Well  that means he's\ngonna lose some valuable time. Adam's route\ndoes look delightful. He's riding by the Rhine. Ooh. Well  you know... At least he gets a little\ntreat before we destroy him. Oh my gosh.\nThere's a castle up there. I'm gonna text Ben and Sam. It's so sad... that they aren't seeing\nthis incredible view. Adam is texting us pictures\nof the Rhine to make us jealous. He's taunting us. So Sam is trying\nto come up with genius psychological warfare. What have you got  Sam? No  we were brainstorming\ncollaboratively. What if we sent him\na picture of the Rhine? That's a good idea. No  that's not bad. Sam  what's the sitch? Okay  VO Sam here\nto explain the sitch. Right now  we're all\nheaded to Münster. Adam's train is scheduled\nto get in at around 7 pm  an hour before our\nfirst rest period. Every night at 8 pm  the game pauses for 10 hours\nso that we can sleep. And then at 6 am\nthe next morning  everyone returns to\nexactly where they were. Adam's plan is to\nmake a quick transfer onto a train towards\nEmden tonight  where the ferry\nto Borkum departs. He won't be able to get\nall the way to Emden before the rest period  but he should be able to make\nit to a town called Lingen. Most importantly \nhe really needs to make it onto a train\nout of Münster tonight  because we're gaining\nground on him. Our train is faster and it's\nscheduled to get into Münster only an hour after him. But to make matters\nworse for Adam  his train is about a\nhalf hour behind schedule  meaning he's about to\nmiss his connection. But because all the announcements\nhave been in German  he hasn't realized\nthat until just... now. Alright  my train is\ngetting in... seemingly very late? I don't know how late... But it was supposed to be\nin Münster a minute ago. And it's still going very fast. As you can see. My GPS isn't really\nworking very well  so I can't actually tell\nhow far from Münster we are. But I'm getting pretty\nscared that it's far. So if it doesn't arrive\nwithin the next six minutes... we are not getting to Lingen. And I'm pretty sure Ben and\nSam are gonna be at my station in under an hour. So... I might need to look\ninto backup plans. I always get so much\ncomment section critique for confidence in this game. But it's manifesting. Manifesting works.\nManifesting— You've gotta\nvisualize your success. That's real science. You've gotta\nbelieve in yourself. Yep. Even if it— Even if all of the odds are\nagainst you. I know with 100% certainty that I will win this season. What? My location is updated now. I'm not even close! What the (bleep)? Wha... What? I'm not gonna make\nit onto my train. I'm gonna arrive to my station. Ben and Sam are gonna be\nthere within like 30 minutes. I don't understand\nwhat happened. My train was never\ndelayed at any point. I don't understand how it's\ngonna get in 20–30 minutes late. He's on a (bleep)\nghost train  Ben. We don't know what he's on. But what we do know is\nthat we got two beers. Zwei... beer.\nI definitely need this. Is what I said to the woman. You're not gonna cheers?\nThat's kind of rude. (clink) Thank you. Excited to spend\na lovely night in Münster. I am... Münster... I'm gonna eat so much cheese. I hope it's actually the place\nthat the cheese comes from. Oh  we're here. Okay. Okay  so my train got in... almost a full\n30 minutes late. Which is infuriating 'cause\nit wasn't delayed in any way  and there was no warning\nthat that would happen. So that means I am\nfor sure not going to make the train that I thought\nI was going to get on. But it's kind of fine? Because I found a backup... that goes in the right\ndirection at least. I'll have to get\noff a stop earlier. Oh my gosh  I thought\nthat woman was Sam. Okay. So Adam is in Münster. It would be ideal\nif he stopped in Münster  'cause then there's a chance\nwe could catch him there. Yeah. Otherwise I don't think we're\ngonna even have a chance to catch him until\nhe gets all the way. Mhm. It looks like he's on the street. So it looks like\nhe's gotten off. This is very confusing. I like the French ones better. This is confusing. Tell me what (bleep)\nplatform it's on. There's no information. There's literally nothing\non here about this. Okay. Okay  we're just gonna have\nto look at every platform. I think they're gonna\nbe here in 20 minutes. No. No. No. No. Okay. Oh no. Okay  it's delayed by 20 minutes. (bleep) They would get here\nin 20 minutes. They would be here...\nin 20 minutes. I'm almost certain. Let's go back to the board. Okay  okay. Okay  what are my options? Let's just look at these. This goes to (bleep)\nDortmund. That's... (bleep) That...\nNo  that doesn't work. They're all delayed. None of this makes any sense. None of this makes any sense! (bleep)-ing what the\n(bleep) is going on here? What is happening?\nWhat is happening? They're gonna be here soon. Alright  all of the trains\nare super confusing. None of them make\nany sense at all. So new plan. We're gonna stay in Münster. We are going to attempt\ntomorrow morning... to sneak onto a train. I'm gonna get into the city. I'm gonna hide. And to make sure I\ndon't get caught... You know I brought a disguise. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus How you feeling  guys? I don't know if\nI want to say this  but you can watch\nthe next episode now if you want to...\non Nebula. Do you want them to  Ben? Yeah  might as well.\nMight as well. But  we have every episode up one week early on Nebula \nincluding this one. That's of course in\nappreciation of the fact that pretty much all the\nrevenue for the show comes from our\nNebula subscribers. So  you know \nwe try to give them the best viewing\nexperience possible by giving them\nevery single episode one week early \namong other stuff. Such as... You can listen to our\nNebula-exclusive aftershow Nebula-exclusive aftershow\ncalled The Layover  where every week \nwe all get together. We break down\nsome of the strategy that went on in the episode. We dive deep on all the stuff\nthat was behind the scenes that we didn't have\ntime to put in. And this week's episode is definitely going to\nbe an interesting one. There's definitely\na lot to answer for. Yeah. But there's more  right? Yeah  so Nebula \nif you don't know  it's a creator-founded \ncreator-owned  creator-run streaming service that was basically founded by a big group of YouTube creators with the intention\nthat it would be the best home for their content. So  not only do you get the\nbest Jet Lag experience  but you also get to see\na ton of original content that can only be viewed\non Nebula. We've made a ton of\nNebula Originals. A lot of other creators\nhave made Nebula Originals. They're basically\nbigger budget versions of the stuff that\nwe make on YouTube. So we are now offering\non Nebula a Lifetime Subscription. You can get access\nto Nebula forever. Never pay Nebula another dime. You just got access\nto it for life. This is not the most\nmoney-efficient way of signing up for Nebula. That would be the\nannual subscription. But if you really want\nto support the show  a huge portion of\nthat money goes to us  and it comes to us up-front \nwhich helps us fund bigger  more absurd\nseasons in the future. And  again  you know \nthe value you get  it's not just the best viewing\nexperience for Jet Lag  it's not just supporting\nJet Lag. It's doing that for\nall sorts of creators  many of whom you\nprobably already watch. So  make sure to click\nthe button on screen or go to\nnebula.tv/jetlag to get 40% off an\nannual subscription. And thank you in advance\nfor your support. Bye! See you there!\nThank you!"

        "transcript": "Welcome to episode 3 of\nour game of Tag Across Europe. As a quick reminder \neach player in the game is trying to get to a\ndifferent location in Europe without getting tagged. Thanks to a series of\nmishaps for the Chasers  Adam  the current Runner  is getting dangerously\nclose to his finish location on the island of Borkum. The good news for\nthe Chasers is that – thanks to delays – Adam is now stranded\nin Münster  Germany  where our train should\nbe arriving any minute  giving us a perfect\nopportunity to catch him. But he's got one last\nplan to evade us. So I'm gonna stay here \ngo into the city  far away from where\nthey would arrive. And to make sure\nI don't get caught... You know I brought a disguise. Ever since last season  I was roasted within an\nabsolute inch of my life continually  until this day  for taking off\nthe wig that I wore. Just taking that unbelievably\nstupid wig off for a second. Aah! (laughs) You got him?\nI got him. Oh  that sucks so much! The problem was \nthat I realized  the wig is way too hot. So instead... I've got a sun hat. Now the sun hat covers\nthe back of my head and the sides of my head\nwith these flappy things. Right?\nI throw a mask on. There's no way you're\ngonna know that that's me. Another thing I realized\nabout my disguise  and disguises in general \nis the key to them is that they can't\nlook like disguises. So you have to think \nwhat would go with the hat? What would somebody\nactually wear with this hat? And what would also cover up\nmy bright pink shorts? Skirt. The backpack is... ...reversible. Plain grey backpack. Totally different vibe. They will not be looking for it. I have no idea where they are. Theoretically  they\ncould have gotten here about ten minutes ago \nat the earliest  I think. If all of my math and\nguesses are right. I'm gonna guess... their train was probably delayed? Seemingly every train\nwas delayed. Ben  what did the\nannouncement just say? (snickers) The train is delayed\nfor 45 minutes. Because they... what?\nWhat do they have to do? They're waiting for\nthe replacement crew here. They're waiting for\nthe replacement crew. Which is a thing. It is—\nIt's a very important thing. But it's currently 7:33. So that means\nthat we would— The rest period would start while this was still\nstopped here in the station. Which means we have\nto get off here and end our day here\nin Dortmund. And not Münster  where Adam is. We can get on a train\ntomorrow morning to Münster and get there before the\nfirst train to Emden. And that definitely\nwon't be delayed. And it definitely\nwon't be delayed. It's the first\ntrain of the day. Because the Deutsche Bahn... runs on time.\nIt's Germans. Oh  it's time to be real. Tomorrow morning... I'm gonna have to\nfind some way to sneak onto the train\nat 7. It'll get me to Emden. I have the coins for it. I just have to get on it. I mean  I just literally\nhave no idea where they are. They might not even\nbe in the city. They might not even\nbe near the city. They also might already be here. How would you rate\nour performance today? I would say our\nperformance was fine. I would say the... Deutsche Bahn's performance\nwas confusing. Hello. I declare ourselves done. We are declaring day\none done for the Chasers. We are stopping here. We will be here at... See you here. 6 am.\n6 am. God  I'm so out of it. Good bye.\nBye. Oh  you can hear the bell.\nThat's nice. Yeah  so it's 8pm. So... now it's the rest period. We'll pick this up... at this exact spot\ntomorrow morning. Like Adam said \nnow it's the rest period. All players will go to\na hotel for the night. We will resume from the\nexact spots we ended tomorrow morning at 6 am. That 6 am start is pretty\nunfortunate for Adam. There's not a train\nto Emden until 7:07  meaning he's stuck\nin Münster until then. But there is a train\nthat Ben and I can take to Münster\nthat gets in at 6:54. Meaning that if all goes well  we'll have the\nchance to catch him. Alright  good morning. Welcome back to\nMünster  Germany  where we are\nvery scared and worried. The important thing is that I need to get on\na train at 7 am  in an hour from now. (sigh) And if they're here \nthat means I'm gonna have to\nsneak past them to get onto that train. They might not be\nanywhere near here. They might be very far away. That would be very funny  if I'm in disguise\nand they're very far away. Cut to them being\nvery far away. Hello! It is 6 am.\nGood morning. And everything\nis totally fine. And everything\ncontinues to be totally fine. Yeah  absolutely great. So now  we are going to\nhop on a train to Münster. Which is gonna be on time. Is that what that means? It can't possibly mean that. Well  it's not on there. Zug fällt aus. I know what that means.\nYeah. Why? He's gonna be able\nto make it to Emden. And we're... We're not. We're gonna be able to\nmake it to Emden eventually. I'm so exposed. If they're here \nthere's no way that they don't get me. I'm just like \nthere's no one around. Literally every shape\nI see  I think is them. Also  it doesn't help that\nI don't have my glasses on. So I'll just see a\nblurry set of colors and think it's Sam's hat. There is an 8:05 am\nto Emden. Okay. So we get on this\ndelayed train to Münster. We miss the\nfirst train to Emden. Adam is on that train \nprobably. We get on the\nnext train to Emden. And hopefully he's\nstill stuck there... Because the ferry\ndoesn't leave... I think  until 12:30. Adam probably thinks\nwe have accidentally gone to Amsterdam\nor something. It's gotta seem so strange. I would at least be\nparanoid if I were him. I'm gonna go home\nand board this train. I figure I'll sit\nin a side seat... and look out the window. So that if they were to board  they wouldn't be\nable to see my face. Okay  this is our train to... You want that one\nor that one? Let's go to that one.\nOkay. That one looks better. (whispering)\nOh  oh  here we go. Yes. Alright. I mean  unless they are somehow at a station above me... we're making it to Emden. Adam has sent us a... a yee-haw emoji \na cowboy emoji. Which one's that? I don't know\nwhat yee-haw means. I don't know what\nyee-haw means. I think it means\nthat he got on that train. Oh  I guess he was probably\nexpecting us to get in before he got on a train.\nDo you think he thinks he's constantly\nswerving us or something? Well  yeah  yeah. Adam  I'm sure\nwhatever you're doing is really smart and cool  but... you can chill out\na little bit. (whispering)\nThis is my breakfast. Okay  so I'm about\nto get to Emden  which is very exciting. There's a ferry from\nEmden to Borkum. If I can get to Borkum \nto the lighthouse  I mean  I win automatically. And the problem is I'm getting into Emden\nat 9:09. There's a ferry at 9 \nso I'll miss that. And the next one\nis not until 12:30. I have to imagine... that they will make it\nto Emden at that time. I mean  it's\nvery  very possible that they're already\non their way here now. I'm gonna go to—\nTrain to Emden is here. I don't know. I don't know\nwhat his plan is. I don't know\nwhat he's gonna do when he gets to Emden. Well  that's the thing. He has to know at this point\nthat once he gets there  he's gonna have three and\na half hours until a ferry. So he's gotta have\nmore of a plan than just 'let's sit around'. I think the\nmove is gonna be... get to Emden \nstay in disguise  do challenges. See if I can save up for a powerup to slip past them at the\nlast minute  potentially. You know. We'll have to see. There is no way\nthat could be real. You crazy for this one  Germany. Alright  so I'm not\ngonna double up  because that costs 250 coins. And right now I do have enough\ncoins to take the ferry. So I don't want to\nrisk losing those. You know  first do\nno harm  basically. Cursed!\nYou are now a knight. You may only walk or run\nin the pattern of a knight. For every three steps\nforward you take  you must take\none step to the side. You will remain a knight\nuntil you go to a castle. Alright  well... Is there a castle here? Okay  no  so there\nare not any castles. Yeah  I think I have\nto veto this. I think if my whole goal\nis to avoid detection  I can't be walking\nin a weird pattern. (deep sigh) Not great. Not great. Okay. Alright  let's just\nkinda wander into the middle of\nnowhere  shall we? Let's get far away from\nwhere they will go. Do you have a\nmessage for Adam  Sam? Hydrate or die-drate. Maybe I'll get\na coffee or something. That would be nice. You know \nmake a day out of it. Make a morning of it. Alright  veto period's up. Draw another card.\nPlease be good this time. Find an American flag. Find a real American flag or a depiction of an\nAmerican flag in the wild. The flag cannot be\ncreated by you in any way. Oof. Okay. Oof. Alright  I don't think I\nwant to veto this again. I need to start earning coins if I want to be able\nto buy that powerup. Okay  let's think. Let's think.\nLet's think. Alright  so my first\nthought on this... is a grocery store. I feel like a grocery\nstore would be likely to have American-made products. And then those might have\nan American flag on them. Oh no  they're all back\ntowards the train station. Oh crap  okay. 'Cause they could be getting\ninto that train station within 20 minutes. Okay  we're gonna run\nto the grocery store. We're going to look\nfor flags on the way  and I should be able to\nget to the grocery store and out before they\ncould get here. Life360 thinks\nthat Adam is driving. Do you think he's driving \nor do you think he's just... Oh  he could be on the bus.\n...booking it? He's going\neight miles per hour  so he must be on a bus. Come on. Pick up the pace. Alright  we're in a little\nmore of a downtown-y area. We've got an Italian flag here. In this wine shop  maybe. Maybe on one of these ads. Domino's Pizza  come on. Come on \ngive it to me  Domino's. Yeah  nothing. Alright  we gotta hurry. They're gonna be here\nin nine minutes. We are not letting\nhim get out of Emden. Unless we accidentally do. Unless we\naccidentally do  we won't. I wish everything\nwas not closed. No  there's a bank. Nope  okay. Alright  we might\nhave to veto this. But we're three minutes\nfrom the grocery store. They might not even\nbe coming here yet. They might not...\nbe anywhere nearby. Oh  come on. It's like a novelty shop. It's got so much\nAmerican stuff. Simpsons. Come on. (whispers)\nOh  that's so close. That looks like an\nAmerican-themed thing. Oh (bleep)! Yes. Yes  there  boom. That is an American flag. Ca-caw! Alright  challenge complete. Oh my god. I did so much running. Alright  we need\nto disguise up now. Pull another challenge. See what we get. Alright. New card  be a good one. Come on. Cursed! You now have\nwet hat syndrome. For the rest of your run  your hat must be wet\nat all times. In order to ensure your hat\nremains sopping wet  you must completely drench\nyour hat in water every half hour. If at the half hour mark  you are unable\nto soak your hat  you may not advance\nin the game until you have done so. Okay  well... This is gonna be\nfunny with this hat  but that gets me... really  really close\nto the coins I need. Basically \nany other challenge... and I can afford\nthe powerup. Let's buy water. Alright  you ready\nto destroy Adam? Yes  we are here in Emden. Where Adam still is. And he is...\nwhat did you say? Only an 8 minute walk from... 8–10 minute walk  yeah. From the station  so... The key is we've\ngotta sneak up on him. Yeah  we can't let\nthis get into a foot race. Right there.\nNice. Hello... three water. Three water  Wasser. Danke. Guten Tag. Okay. (water dripping) Awesome. He's moving again. Maybe we want to get in a... ...taxi?\nWell  it's so close that I kind of doubt\nit's worth it. He's in a\nbig park or something. Alright  I'm going to\nrun for just a little bit to try to just build up\nsome distance on them  if they have just gotten here. Then I'll probably\njust transition into walking as far away\nas I can get. He is on this road \nbut he's quite far. But we need to not get spot... Spotted. Let's actually cross the road  because that'll\nrestrict our sightline. Okay  okay. Okay  he's going\nfurther that way now. Okay. But on the same road? Yes. He was just in this park. When we got to the station \nhe was in this park. Okay. So we're not far at all. Look  it's the water. That's cool. Okay  well he's by water. He's already done the thing. He's by water? Yeah  he's by some little\ncanal or inlet or something. Okay. We are hot on his tail. Okay. So the key is then... we have to spot him\nbefore he spots us. And we've got to be\nreally smart about when to go in\nfor the tag. Okay  so that's the waterway. You said he's on the other side. Here  you see? Here  Ben  look. We're right there. Well  I think what\nwe should do... One of us posts up there. The other one move in from here. From where\nwe are right now? Right  on this road. He's probably doing a challenge\nand not paying attention. Alright  I think I'm far\nenough away from the train station that I have time to\npull a quick challenge. Shuffle  shuffle. Cursed!\nFor the rest of your run  you may only\ntake transportation that leaves at\nodd-numbered times. This is based on the last digit\nof scheduled departure times. Nope. Nope. Definitely can't do that. (bleep) That's a veto. (bleep) So  you understand\nwhere you're going? Yeah  so I'm\ngoing down this road. Down this road \nto this crossroad there. Yep. Okay. I'll hide behind this corner. Yeah  yeah. Text me once you've arrived. Okay. Good luck. You too. Well... Shoot. Well  if they're not here yet... I have to guess that\nthey'll be here soon. I think we gotta\njust keep moving. I think we gotta just\nkeep in motion here. Okay  so I'm here. Sam's here  Adam's there. It looks like\nhe's coming my way. He's probably about\nto cross right up there. And then I will follow behind. Oh my god. He's in disguise. Yes. Hello?\nBen? Yeah  he's close. He's coming to you \nand he's in disguise. Okay. Oh  he's in disguise. I saw him. He's in a\nsundress or something. (softly)\nSundress  okay got it. Got it  got it  got it. (slow-mo)\nOhhh (bleep)! (giggling) Come here  Adam! Oh my god  they're running.\nThey're running. There's no escape! I believe in you  Ben. I just don't think... (both panting exhaustedly) I don't think there was\na way out of that for me. I certainly don't\nthink you're getting on the ferry after that. One hell of a run! Well done. We got him! Let's go! Where the hell\nwere you guys? Ben  what's your prediction\non the first thing Adam will say\nwhen we catch him? \"Oh  where were you guys?\" Where the hell were\nyou guys this morning? I thought you were\ngoing to be in Münster. The Deutsche Bahn. Yeah  they're bad trains. Ohh. They have (bleep)-ed\nus so many times. I can't even begin to describe. There's Sam. Yeah  I see him. Hi  Sam. Hello. How's it going? Nice little breezy\noutfit you got there. Did it throw you off at all? What? No. I saw it immediately\nand I was like  oh  he's in a disguise. Yeah  I was\nworried about that. Well  anyway. I mean  good luck getting\nout of my territory  boys. Cards! Cards! Give me your cards!\nGive me your cards! In fairness...\nGimme your cards! In fairness \nI really needed them. Gimme the cards!\nOkay! Okay! Here! Thank you. It's 10:31. I'm leaving. Good bye. Bye  Sam.\nGood luck  Sam. Thank you  Ben. Okay  that was pretty\nperfect timing. I have just enough time to make the next train south to Münster. Back at the station. Deutsche Bahn  please\ndon't let me down. Yeah  we just gotta get Sam. I think he has to— I think he basically has to go all the way back to Münster \n'cause these are all tiny regional stations.\nYeah  yeah  yeah. Okay  well  actually... If you were trying to\ngo directly to Paris... Yeah? It wouldn't have you\ngoing back to Münster. Because this route gets him into\nthe Netherlands pretty quickly. Yeah  here we go.\nYeah  this  I agree. I think this is what he'll take. Emden to Salzbergen \nSalzbergen to Hengelo  Hengelo to Zutphen \nZutphen to Breda  Breda to Antwerpen  Antwerpen to Paris. I think that is likely  right? I bet you that he goes\nthrough the Netherlands just to avoid Deutsche Bahn. Alright  slight\nchange of plans. I've done some research  and I think there's\na better option than going all the\nway back to Münster. Because I can get off\nat a stop before them called Salzbergen. And from there... there is a\n35-minute transfer to a train over the border\nto the Netherlands. So we're going from\nDeutschland to Dutchland. I'm sorry. What I can do after that\nis I can string together a bunch of regional trains  kind of not through\nbig cities at all. And the advantage is they will mathematically\nhave to stay one hour behind on basically the\nexact same trains. But  I will have some decent 30  20  40 minute\nconnections where I can hopefully\nearn enough budget to be able to keep going. And I think it gets\nbetter  because the advantage of getting down\ninto Belgium is from there  the fastest route for Ben\nto get to his destination... The fastest route is\nthrough Paris  my zone. So he's going to be incentivized\nto go deeper into my zone. Which will advantage\nme in the long term. So I think this is\nthe best bet. Alright  we're out\nof our freeze period. And Sam has gotten on the train\nthat we expected him to get on. And there is another train... that does the same\nthing in  what... half an hour?\n30 minutes from now. It's just an hour behind Sam. Can we buy water on the way? We can.\nI'm so thirsty. I accidentally\nbought all sparkling water. Wasserbetten? I think Wasserbetten\nsells water beds. Oh. Oh my gosh  Ben  Ben. Yeah? We have to get in Germany  Trolli Saure Glühwürmchen. Oh  they're glowworm. Ben  you can\nfinally find out what a glowworm tastes like. Oh  we're on\nthe train to Münster. But  in a much more\nreal sense  Adam... Where are we? Wait  wait  I was chewing. Oh. I'm gonna get to it. We're in The Snack Zone  baby! That's true. Today  we're gonna\nbe having some... Saure Glühwürmchen. It tastes like I'm\neating a real animal. Alright  welcome\nto Salzbergen. Okay  so... Cards shuffled. Let's hope it's a good one. It seems that he is\nstopping in Salzbergen  which means he's probably\ngonna transfer to Hengelo. So...\nOh  this also means that if he (bleep) himself\non a challenge  if he does pull a challenge here\nand he (bleep) himself... Yeah.\nWe'll get him there. We will  yeah. So  Sam  if you're\npulling a challenge there  good luck  buddy. 'Cause you're gonna need it. Let's hope it's a good one. Cursed! You are now being\nRatatouille'd. The next move you make\nwill be decided by a rat. Please access the\nSmithsonian Zoo's naked mole rat live feed\nand go to Camera 2. Whatever direction you first\nsee a rat cross the camera  you must travel at least\n2 miles in that direction before continuing. Cursed. Oh no. Oh no. I've been Ratatouille'd. Oh no! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Alright  I wonder\nwhat's gonna happen. (wheezes) If you're wondering\nwhat's gonna happen  you can watch the\nnext episode right now by signing up for Nebula. What else you\ncan get on Nebula is the Layover podcast. It's the Nebula-exclusive\ncompanion podcast to Jet Lag. We do an episode\nevery single week  correlating to each episode\nof the season itself  explaining a little bit\nmore of the strategy  explaining what happens\noff-camera. Answering for our failures  explaining some of the behind\nthe scenes production stuff. And we actually  we have a\nlot of that this episode  because we talk about... we talk about what\nwould have happened if Adam had just won the season at the beginning of day two  after we flew\nall the way to France... One ferry ride away  baby! ..to film a whole season\nof Jet Lag. It would not have been awesome \nbut we did have a plan. We did have a plan for\nif that had happened. So we explain all of that in\nthe Layover episode this week. And also on Nebula  there's all kinds\nof great other stuff from all of your other\nfavorite creators. There's a ton of\nNebula Originals. Those are exclusive projects\nthat are only on Nebula. Things like The Prince  a giant stage play\nfrom Philosophy Tube. Things like\nNight of the Coconut  an entire feature length\nfilm from Patrick (H) Willems. Stuff from Real Science \nRealLifeLore  Real Engineering  all of the Reals \na bunch of other things. And also  you know \nwhen you sign up for Nebula  you're helping to support\nindependent creators  because Nebula is creator-founded\nand creator-owned. And if you want to sign up\nfor Nebula for a limited time  they're doing something\na little unusual: Lifetime memberships. So for $300\n– a one-time payment – you can become a member\nof Nebula for life. Now  I want to be clear.\nThis is not necessarily the cheapest way to get\naccess to Nebula. That would be the annual plan \n$30 a year with our code. This is for if you really\nwanna support the show  and you really wanna\nsupport Nebula. This gives the show and Nebula a lot of cash on-hand right now that we can invest in\nfuture big projects. Future Jet Lag seasons and\nfuture Nebula projects  and do that without\ntaking outside investment. So if you want to\nsign up for Nebula  whether it's a monthly plan \nan annual plan  or you want to go big and\ndo the Lifetime membership and really  really support\nNebula or the show  but getting any of\nthem would be great.

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nto episode four of our game of\nTag Across Europe. Near the end of last episode  Ben and I managed to tag Adam\nin Emden  Germany  only one ferry ride away from\nhis end location in Borkum. That means that\nI'm the Runner now  and I'm hoping to make it\nall the way over here to Jersey  UK. So far  I've spent\nhalf of my budget getting to Salzbergen  where my plan is to head\nthrough the Netherlands  back to Paris \nand go from there. But my next move might not be\nas predictable as I had hoped  because I just drew\nthe Ratatouille Curse. If I don't veto it \nthe direction I travel in next will be decided  at random  by the naked mole rats\nat the Smithsonian  possibly sending me straight\nback towards the Chasers. But if I do veto it \nit means trudging forward into the Netherlands with\nhardly any budget left. So what do I do? Mmm  do I veto this? Oh  I need to decide fast. Okay  so basically\nit's a 1-in-4 chance that I get the west\ndirection that I need. I'm looking for scooter\nrentals or something  but I don't see any. Grrr! Okay  so here's the problem. North  I go right back to them. East  there's no trains. South  there's a train that\ncould take me one stop south  but there's no train\nthat I could make before they would get to\nthat next stop to the south. So  basically  with a\n3-out-of-4 chance of getting caught if I accept this curse... I think I've got to veto it and just wait for this train and hope that I can\ndo another challenge on my next connection. That sucks. Well... I don't think I'm gonna be\nin Salzbergen again  so... may as well\nlook around. Jeez  look at the\nsize of this thing. This is very cool. Let's go look at this church. It looks... historic. The advantage of walking\naround is that hopefully we'll make them think that\nI'm doing a challenge. We want them to lose\nconfidence  I guess. I don't really know why \nbut it seems like a good idea. We should not be operating\nfrom a place of fear. No. 'Cause he's the one\nthat is in a bind. Right  not us. Wait  was that  that\nseemed like a real glitch. There were\ntwo identical men wearing identical clothes\nwho had bikes. Let's see if we can get this. I think that's\njust what Germany is. No  no  no.\nNo  no  no  look. There's one. Those are the same man. They're the exact same. Those are identical men.\nThey're identical men. We're gonna blur their faces. We're gonna blur their faces \nbut that's going in the video. Those are the same man. Here we go. You can tell we're\nin the Netherlands  because there's\nalready bike paths. They are the same man. Look  they are the same man.\nThat is the same man. And they're gonna sit\nnext to each other. Maybe they're best friends. I think that that's a cool way\nto find your best friend. Yeah. Everyone's best friend is just\nwhoever looks the most like them. Yeah.\nThat's the system. Actually  everyone I've\never met who looks like me  I have hated. Ohh  there we go. Welcome to Salzbergen. It's so hot here.\nYeah. How did it get so much hotter? What I would like to do\nis go inside of a building. But  oh  there is a building. Okay  good. This is probably my... biggest incentive\nto make it south. Okay  now I'm arriving\nin Hengelo. The train I need\nto take out of Hengelo leaves in 19 minutes. So if I want to earn\nany budget here  I need to do it before\nthat train leaves. If I miss it \nBen and Adam will arrive before I have\na chance to escape. Alright  next train\nis at 1:46. Name of the game:\ndon't miss that train. Second name of the game:\npull a challenge. Third name of the game:\ncomplete that challenge. Fourth name of the game... Hydrate. Okay. Shuffle  shuffle. Shuffle  shuffle. Okay  we're pulling this card. Find the town hall. You have 30 minutes to find the town hall of\nwherever you are without consulting your phone\nor asking anyone for help. If the building you\nassert to be the town hall is not the town hall  you automatically veto\nthe challenge. If you fail to find the\ntown hall within 30 minutes  you automatically veto\nthe challenge. Oh my god  we gotta go. We gotta go  we gotta go. We gotta go. We only have 19 minutes \nbecause... because... we have a train to catch. Alright  let's try\nto find a map. The German train stations\ndefinitely had maps. No map. There's a map. I found a map.\nI found a map. Found a map.\nFound a map. Oh my god.\nThere's a map. Oh  this is great! Oh  no  this isn't very helpful. (groan) Here in Salzbergen. We still have to just\nhang out here for a half hour. I'm so excited to go\nto the Netherlands. I've never been. I imagine it will\nlook a lot like this. Well  it is funny\nwhen you look at Europe  especially this area\nof Europe  it's like: There's France \nand it's so big. And then there's Germany \nand it's so big. And then there's just Netherlands  Belgium \nLuxembourg. It's all kind of\nthe same thing  though. They're not going to like\nthat I said that. I would not say that\nall of them are the same thing. I feel like\nthere have been many... sort of very notable conflicts about how they're\nnot the same thing. Yeah  but my assessment\nis that they were kind of... going a little overboard\nwith that. Okay  so we're there. But there's no buildings marked. I've gotta assume it's nearby. I like the look of that\nkind of square thing. I'm gonna start\nlooking over there-ish. (anxious snickering) I'm pretty sure\nI suggested this challenge  and I regret it already. Town halls in\nEuropean cities tend to be in the most prominent\ncenter kinda square. At least that's my\nexperience with... other European countries. Because it's all\nkind of  they're just  they like their\nlittle chocolates. You think the people\nwho didn't want it all to be one thing\nwent overboard? I think... 'Cause think\nabout who did want it to be all one thing\nand who didn't. A man by the\nname of Jesus Christ (wheezes) ...wanted us to\ncome together as one. We hate Nazis. Disclaimer. This feels... This feels central. Ooh. That kinda feels\npretty central. Look at that church and the\nother tower in the background. I want to go over there. I'm really running out of time. This is not great. Okay  I'm liking this. Okay  well that's \nyou know  definitely a church. However  that tower  I'm not sure if it's a church. It doesn't really seem to have\nany religious symbols on it. Yeah  this building is interesting. It has bells. I think I see offices. It's got flags.\nIt's got flags. It's got the EU flag. Ohh. Come on. Just haven't seen a sign on it. We're really running out of time. There's just gotta be\na sign on it somewhere  right? Okay. If I'm\ngonna make that train... I have to call it. I don't see a sign. I'm gonna declare it. I declare that\nmy assumed city hall. Now let's see. Yep  that was it. Okay  okay  we gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. Train leaves in five minutes. I gotta carefully run a bit  which I'm probably\ngonna regret later. Let's goooo! Let's go on a little walk. It's so hot though. Yeah  I know  get over it. We could go\nto the Flohmarkt. Oh my gosh  the Floh— They really want you to go. Oh  see  here we go.\nHere's the little downtown. Quick  Ben  say\nsomething really funny  'cause this shot is pretty. We can use it. Bing-bong. Okay  almost back. We got this. Leaves in two minutes. Platform 2A. Two... One... Is this it? Zutphen. (bleep) yes. Adam  what's the update? What's the Sam status? Ben  he has left Hengelo  and he is on his way\nto Zutphen. So he continues on... his basically\none-hour lead on us. Yeah  okay  it says Hengelo. So I certainly don't\nwant to panic  by any means. But I will say... Sam is making progress. It is— He is reaching the point of\nmeaningful-ish progress. We'll see. I mean  all we can\nreally do right now is... stay right behind him. Yep  it's true. And... It's true. If something devious comes up  we can try and jump him. Yeah. Oh  look  look. We're in the Netherlands  Ben. This is the Dutch countryside. It looks...\nWe're in Holland. ...freaking crazy out here. They've got a factory. And trees. That house.\nHouse. It's exactly the way\nI always dreamed it would be! This is my Netherlands. Welcome to Zutphen. Okay  so I got about 30 minutes\nuntil my next safe train. The one that  you know... The next one\nthat they can't make. Or rather  my last safe train. But I don't have the\nbudget for that anyway  so I need to do a\nchallenge either way. So I think I might as well\nbuy the double-up powerup  because if I don't\ncomplete this challenge and I have to veto it  I'm pretty much caught\nhere either way. Yeah  let's buy it. Lock it in. (pff) That's the lock it in \nI don't know  graphic or... Damn it. Okay. Final shuffle. (sigh) Come on. See something old. You have 30 minutes to find\nthe oldest thing you can. You must be able to verify\nthe thing's age within 50 years. Your reward is the\nage of your old thing  up to 2 000 coins. This is great. This is no risk. Okay  we gotta go. I see an old tower thing there. I'm gonna go walk towards that.\nThat seems like a good start. Welcome to the\nNetherlands  Adam. Thank you! It's 2:29  and he's\nstill in Zutphen. So I think that means\nhe had to stop in Zutphen for a challenge \nwhich is great  cause that means\nwe'll gain a half hour. We're about to hop\non a train to Zutphen. So you better hurry up  Sam  or we're gonna getcha. So it seems like we came to\na great spot for this challenge. There is a church from the\n11th century in this town  but the problem is that we have to verify the\nthing's age within 50 years. All the references just\nsay \"11th century\". Nobody seems really sure about\nits origin date beyond that. There's also the oldest\npublic library in the world right here in this town \nwhich is crazy. But  I wasn't able to find\na date super quickly on that  so I'm gonna go to\nthis church for now... which seems like a good one\nthat does have specific dates. Look at this. Gorgeous. It's pretty old looking. Alright  I'm going to try\nto get a specific date. Okay  so this is\nofficially Broederenkerk. And it was built \naccording to this website  between 1307 and 1308. It seems like there might be slightly better options\nin this town  but the train I want to\ntake is in 15 minutes. And I can't really verify\nany other ones quickly  and the station is\n5-10 minutes away  so I think I'm going\nto lock this in. That was lucky. Alright  let's get\nback to the station. Is that us?\nThat's our train. Let's go get on it. It looks like he's headed\nback towards the station. So  I think he is going\nto take a train at 2:58. Then  if we do\nget in at 3:23  we can get on a train\nin 5 minutes  headed to where he's headed. It's not a lot of time  Sam. That's not a lot of margin! A lot of things  Sam! Back at the station. Alright  we're gonna head\nalmost two hours south to Breda. From there  there's one more\ntrain to get me to Brussels  which would be awesome. But to be honest  I'm not\nsure if I have a safe— a kind of mathematically\nsafe option out of Breda. I'll do a bunch of\nresearch on the train. That might be where\ntoday's journey ends. But if Ben continues\nto track south  which makes sense \nthat would be great. 'Cause then if we can\nshut down Adam's quickly  I can get another run and seal the deal \nI think  tomorrow. Okay. We are in Zutphen. Welcome to Zutphen. Sam left here not long ago. Yeah  he left here\nabout 20 minutes ago  25. And we have a train\nin 10 minutes. So we're going to be\n35 minutes behind Sam now  which I think is pretty good. That's still better. I mean  it's...\nPretty good. It does not give him\na lot of margin. It's a pretty\nstraightforward chase here. Yeah  we're just\nchasing after him. Which he's evading. Okay  so...\nI've done my research. In Breda  I get in at 4:40. There is a train to\nBrussels leaving at 4:42. So  if I can make that transfer  I can make it all\nthe way to Brussels with the budget I have  safely. If I miss that transfer  I don't think I have\nanother good option. I'll probably\nget caught in Breda. But yeah \nwe'll just have to see if we can make that\ntwo-minute transfer. Let's hope it's just across\nthe platform or something. That'd be awesome. Alright  off to Breda. Or wherever he stops \nif he stops earlier. I think these are the nicest\ntrain seats we've had. Like movie theater seats. I feel like\nI'm gonna see a movie. I'm gonna see a movie\nof what it looks like... of everything between\nZutphen and Breda. Yeah  it's gonna\nbe an awesome movie. Okay  well... Everything was going great. I was j chillin  watchin the Formula 1 British\nGrand Prix  which was great. And we stopped here  and\na big storm blew through. And now this train is cancelled. And I don't speak Dutch \nso that's the extent I know. All I know is that it's\nnot goin' more that way. Where am I  by the way? Okay  well the first letter\nin where I am is an apostrophe  so I'm not really sure\nhow to pronounce that  but I'm gonna call\nit Hertogensbosch... 's–Skert— 's–Serto—\nErto–gzenbosch. Adam  Adam. I do not like to wake you... But it appears that Sam\nhas gotten off the train at 's-Hertogenbosch. He's off the train\nat Hertogenbosch? At apostrophe-S–\nHertogenbosch. I don't know why it\nstarts with an apostrophe. That's potentially\ngood news  maybe. Oh  we're quite close to there. Yes. Oh  great. We'll be in Hertogenbosch\nin about 15 minutes. Okay  so the deal is\nthat there seems to be a signal switch issue somewhere\nbetween here and Breda. The problem is that\nBreda is where I need to go to transfer to Belgium. Or maybe I can get\nto Eindhoven? Let's check.\nThat's to the south. There's a 4:50 to Eindhoven. It's in 21 minutes. I mean  there's\nevery chance that Ben and Adam\nare right behind me. We're approaching\nwhere he is. I think we have to\nget off the train. What is this? Yeah  that's the\nstation where he's at. There's trains that keep\nshowing as cancelled. And I think  like our train  its future stops must've\nbeen cancelled or something. It says \n\"Eindpunt van deze trein\". That sounds like\n\"endpoint of this train.\" \"Endpoint of this train.\" There are no trains running between Tilburg and\n\"S-Verbagden\" due to a signal failure. Yeah  okay. And this says\nterminus of this train  so this train is stopping here. That might be\nwhy he's trapped. Maybe. Okay  well \nthe sign says that... The sign says that seemingly  the signal issue is\nbetween here and Tilburg  which is the next stop. That makes me worried that\nBen and Adam's train canceled  but only from here. Meaning they're\nprobably pulling up literally right now. It looks like\nhe's in the building. Mm-kay. I think he might have gotten\nscrewed by train cancellations. There's a lot of people.\nOh yeah  look at all these people. Yeah  I think all the\ntrains got cancelled. Oh  Sam. Oh  that sucks\nfor you  buddy. Alright. We have to be a little sneaky. Do you have him\non the tracker? Okay  this seems\nto be the platform that Ben and Adam's\ntrain would be at... if it existed. Which it doesn't seem to. Hopefully. It just shows\nhim on that platform. That train's not\ngonna leave  is it? Ben  figure out where\nthis train's going  in case we need to\nbook tickets on it. Says his location is\nliterally right here. So he must—\nI think he's above us. Should we not\ngo in and look? We would see him\nthrough the window. Okay  this train is... seemingly going to leave. Is he on this train?\nShould we get on it? I think he's trying to\ntrick us into getting on it. Here  we need to run up here. I mean  it literally\nshows him right here. Maybe he is on the\ndang train  I don't know. He's doing a relatively good\njob of hiding somewhere. And you do have to\ngive it up for that. You do have to\nrespect him for that. Okay  wai-wai-wait.\nOh no  it just updated. Okay  no  he's over there. I got you.\nOh  there he is. Your train not cance— Your train didn't cancel\ntill here? No.\nIt canc— It got here. It got here \nand then it cancelled. I thought I\nchecked your platform. Well  I was...\nprepared for that. Uh... Yeah  good luck!\n(laughs) Bye  boys. I have to figure out\nhow to get outta here with all these cancellations. Okay. Okay  there's a train... going in the right direction. It leaves from here. Okay  that's my train. Ben's already on the move. That probably means he's\ngoing down to Eindhoven. Oh  did that train\nalready leave? It left at 4:55 or 4:56. Okay  so it\nleft a minute ago. And he's on the move. Well  I think that was the only train\nleaving the station. Well  it seems like the best\nway around this signal fault. I have made it to Eindhoven. Eindhoven. Seemingly... my options are pretty limited. But I'm gonna pull a challenge. And because... desperate times call for\ndesperate measures... I am also going to be\ndoubling it. This is kind of my last shot. It's all gonna come down\nto what I pull. The deck has gotten\na lot lighter since I last had it. Okay  we're gonna pull\na top one. Remember  this is doubled. Choose your own adventure. Do 50 burpees.\nThere is no time limit. A burpee has been\nsuccessfully completed when you have done a push-up\nand jumped in the air. Your push-ups do not\nneed to be perfect. Do your best. Or: Estimate your\ncity's population. You get one guess. You must be within 25%\nof the right answer or you automatically\nveto this challenge. I think I'm\ngonna do 50 burpees. 900 doubled  1 800. That's pretty good. Maybe that gives me\nsome more options. There's a train to Brussels... at 5:41 from here. Two hours and 27 minutes. I could afford that\nif I did this in time. Okay. We have to do 50 burpees. So... One. Okay  that was one. Two. Three. Oh my god. Ben is out in... Eindhoven  seemingly.\nYeah. So I think we just want to\ntake the soonest one to there  which is that 5:36\nto Maastricht. We'll be free\nthree minutes before then. Yeah. I mean  that would be great. So the question now is does he head basically east  which would indicate\nhe's going to Germany  or west  which indicates\nhe's going down to Belgium? Or do we just catch him in  you know  about 20 minutes?\nOr that. That's an option. Yeah  that's an option too. (tired huff) Four. (breathing heavily) Five. Oh god  oh no. Ohh  six. Ohh. (groan) Ah (bleep) Alright. So Ben... is... Well  let me check.\nBen is in Eindhoven. Is he still\nin Eindhoven though? He is still in Eindhoven. He's still in Eindhoven. We will be there\nin about 20 minutes. Yes. So that's not great\nfor Ben  I would say. So it is time for him\nto get on a train. Yeah. Thirteen. Fourteen. Four...teen. He could take this to... Den Haag.\nThe Hague. That would be the wrong way. No  that would\ntake him to Breda. 'Cause he could do\nBreda to Brussels. Right. Well he doesn't— He's not gonna have the\nbudget to get to Brussels. Ugh  28. (grunt  panting) I think I can get to... I think I can get to Brussels  because there's a transfer... at Breda. It's 20 minutes  so I can finish this\nchallenge there. You can do it  pal. Ben should be leaving if he's on the train\nthat we think he's on. I mean  I— For his sake  I really\nhope he is on it. Thirty... two. (shudder) Thirty seven. (exhausted breathing) Okay  here's the situation. I am on the train to Breda. I don't have enough\nto keep going. But if I finish... thirteen burpees... in the train station\nbefore my transfer... then I can make it and I can get out of there\nand keep going. Pray for me. Ooh.\nOh. Ooh. Oh. That's looking—\nThere you go  Ben. There you go.\nNice job. Now that's resounding. I think he's... Yeah. Nice job.\nYeah. There you go  buddy. There you go  there you go. So that means Ben's\ntaking the French route. Which is smart. Or at least the Belgian route. Yes. One would assume. Or  at least  the Breda route. I mean \nit could also mean that Ben just panicked\nand got on a train. (sigh) 20 minutes\nuntil my next train. I don't have enough\nto get on it  so I need to do\n13 more burpees. One— Oh my god. That is the door. No  left. Okay  shut up. (sigh) Alright. So here's the sitch. Things are... good now but potentially could be\nbad very soon in the future. Could swiftly turn from...\nYeah. ...great to... not as good.\nI would say (bleep) Ben could get on a\ntrain to Brussels and get all the way\nto Brussels Airport before the rest period starts. Yes. Yes.\nIf he has the budget. Meanwhile  we would\nbe stuck in Breda because we couldn't get\non a train to Brussels. It would leave too late\nfor the rest period. And at that point... he would have built... almost an\nhour and a half lead. Potentially more. Plus however long\nit takes in the morning to get on a train towards him. 41. Ugh. 42. Ugh. Which is a far cry\nfrom the 15-minute lead that he had...\njust moments ago. So basically  if Ben has... right now  more than\n1 200-ish coins  we're in a lot of trouble. (stiff groaning) 50. 50. (exhales loudly) 50. I did 50. Let's get on\nthe train to Brussels. Ohh. Oh  my whole body hurts. I've never done those before. What? Who the hell...\nthought about those? I did that all so quickly  I didn't even have time to... look at what trains they\nmight even be on  so... I have no idea where\nthey could be right now. But I'm just hoping\nthat I can get on this train to Brussels\nbefore they get here. That's all I got. So basically  if Ben is about\nto get on a train to Brussels  if we are cutting— Look  here's the situation. I'm assuming that we just\ncut from footage of Ben saying what he's about to do. And if what\nhe just said was  \"I'm getting on\na train to Brussels \" then we are in a lot of trouble. I made it onto the train. Well  Adam... I have good news\nand I have bad news. (guffaws)\nWhich one would you like first? Is the good news that\nhe's still at the station? No. Let's check how screwed\nwe are for tomorrow morning. Okay...? Alright  first train\nfrom Breda to Brussels. Starting at 6 am. Eeegh  ooh. You want the bad news\nor the bad news? (giggles) Not until 7:42? So Ben's 15 minute lead... Will now be two hours. Two hours  thanks to... train schedules/overnight. Oh  that's not great. So  yeah. (silly grumbles) We're sure there's nothing...? Well  we gotta get off now. So let's look at trains\nleaving in the next hour. These are all going\nback to the Netherlands. This one's heading to Brussels  but we can't take that one because its first stop is\nafter the rest period starts. We can't get to Antwerp tonight. No  we cannot get\nto Antwerp tonight. So we can get to Rotterdam  but there's no sense\nto go to Rotterdam because it's further away \nand the train that goes faster from Rotterdam to Brussels\nis sold out. I think that might be\nGG for today. What about if we... (bleep)\n(both cracking up) What if we what  Adam? If we... (wheezes) Sure... Surely there's\nsomething we can do. You wanna just go\nstraight to Zermatt? No  I don't wanna go\nstraight to Zermatt. They have glacier skiing. Yeah  I'm sure. I don't have a\nlot of suggestions. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus It's Ben time  baby. And if you want to\nsee more of my run  you can watch next week's\nepisode right now  only on Nebula. On Nebula \nyou can also listen to our Nebula-exclusive\npodcast  The Layover  where we recap every\nweek's episode. This week we will\nrecap the strategy  the behind the scenes\nof this episode. And we'll also reveal the exciting and strange\nMcDonald's items that we got from the\nBelgian McDonald's during our rest period. Wait  what did we get? Well  I got... Well  don't tell them.\nWell  you can't tell them. Yeah  it's exclusive. Anyway  Nebula is great \nin my opinion. And part of my opinion\nis based on the fact that I was a co-founder\nof Nebula  and that's 'cause myself and\na bunch of other creators  we got together\na couple years ago and we were basically asking  how do we create the\nbest viewing experience for viewers like you? And the most sustainable\nplatform for creators like us? And the answer was Nebula. From the audience's side  they get to watch all\nthese big-budget Originals where we give  you know \nwe give creators more than they normally have to produce a normal\nvideo on YouTube  and we see what they\ncan make with even more. So we've had some stuff \nlike we had Patrick Willems's first\nfeature-length film  The Coconut \nit was awesome. Night of the Coconut.\nYeah. We had Philosophy Tube's\nfirst kind of fully produced play. It was also awesome  and we filmed it and\nput it on the platform. Tons more. It's great.\nI love the Originals. And then of course\nwe also have all of these creators'\nnormal stuff ad free  a lot of it early. We have we have some\nexclusive companion stuff like The Layover  for example. There's really so much to it  more than I can\npossibly explain here. And then  on the flip side  what we do to make sure\nthe platform is sustainable for creators is a portion of the\nsubscription fee when you sign up as a viewer goes to the creator. So when you sign up \nfor example  at nebula.tv/jetlag  we get a portion of that for\nas long as you stay subscribed. Which gives us  you know  predictable recurring\nmonthly revenue that's not subject to kind\nof the whims of ad rates that we can rely on\nto grow our business and do more of Jet Lag and make it bigger\nand better and cooler. So  yeah \nit really works well because it gives a better\nviewing experience for you and a more sustainable\nbusiness model for us. So  make sure to click\nthe button on the screen or go to nebula.tv/jetlag\nto sign up. And thanks in advance\nfor your support. Bye!\nGood bye!"

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nto episode 5 of our 72-hour game of tag  where each of us\nis trying to get to a different location in Europe before the other two\ncan tag them. Right now  Ben's on his\nway to Zermatt  Switzerland with a huge lead  thanks to a series of\nescalating setbacks for the Chasers. See  as Ben made his way\nthrough the Netherlands  we wanted to go\ndirectly to Breda  a hub where we\ncould cut him off  but a signal fault forced us\nto go a much longer route. Once finally in Breda \nBen was headed to Belgium. We wanted to take a\ntrain to Brussels  but discovered it made\nits first stop at 8:01  one minute after the\nrest period begins  meaning we weren't\nallowed to get on it. So instead  we figured\nwe'd go up to Rotterdam and take a high-speed train\nto Brussels in the morning. But then it turned out\nthat train was sold out. So we have to wait\nto take a train when the game starts at\n6 am tomorrow morning. But this small train station\ndoesn't have a train to Brussels until 7 am the next morning. All of which is how\nBen's 15-minute lead just turned into a\n3 hour lead. And as you can tell  we aren't feeling\namazing about it. This just seems impossible\nthat it could be this bad. So now we get\nto Brussels at 9 am? Yes. Three hours\nafter the game starts? Yes. (grunt) There's gotta be... That can't be right! Okay  let's... Okay. (softly)\nOff to Belgium  then. I didn't really think\nI'd get this far  so I'm feeling pretty good. I am going to get to\nthe Brussels Airport by the rest period. I'll be able to start from\nthere tomorrow morning. When will Sam and Adam\nbe able to get there? Who knows? They know  probably. Is there a bus or something? I'm— I don't think so. Is there a place that\nwe could take a taxi to that would be useful? I don't think so. Are we sure  though? Stick with me for a second here. ...No. There's gotta be something. My god  how is this possible? I don't think he's\ntaking the news well. (dejected sigh) We could go get some dinner. Are we sure we've\nexhausted all of our options? I mean... Wait  wait  let me look. Okay  what if\nwe tried to go to Roosendaal and Antwerp in the morning \npotentially? We could. Okay  I'm just... Just for starters \nwe could do that. Also  we could take a\n29-minute car to Brecht. Okay  yes. Brecht is even better. Yeah  see  look. Brecht to Brussels\ntomorrow morning  6 am. We get there at 7:36  look. I think that checks out. Okay  so there's\na lot going on here  so let's walk you through it. Basically \nwhat Adam figured out is that the Chasers\ncan use our ability to take\n30-minute taxi rides to go to a place\ncalled Brecht tonight. Brecht just so happens\nto have a train right when the game starts\nnext morning  to Antwerp  where we can then make a\nquick connection to Brussels. In total  this one\nlittle move will save us a whole 90 minutes. Which is why... We need to get in\na taxi to Brecht right now. So we hopped in an Uber and made it to the station just in time\nfor the rest period. Alright  we are at\nNoorderkempen  and we have reached\nthe end of day two. Good night. Good night \nsee you in the morning! Meanwhile  Ben made\nit to Brussels Airport. Coincidentally \nthe exact location where we ended\nday two last season. We are here at\nthe Brussels Airport. Someone on my train\ngot arrested for smelling a lady's hair  so that's kind of interesting. Anyway  what is my plan? What's the plan?\nWhat is the plan? Great question.\nHere's Ben's plan: Luxembourg. It's in his win region  and he has a lot of\noptions from there. He's hoping to chain together\na few trains to get there  with stops in\nCharleroi and Namur. But first  it's time to sleep. Okay  good night. (smooch) So yada yada yada \nrest period  and it's 6 am the next morning. Ben gets on his train\nto Charleroi  we go to Antwerp \nand just like that  the chase is back on. Okay  so  headed to Brussels  but I think that's on... I think it's\nliterally right there. Literally this platform. Welcome to Antwerp. It's a very cool train station. We should go up.\nLook at that. Let's go up a level.\nLet's go look at it. I feel like this\nis one of those things that somebody would\nframe up really neatly in one of those\nreally annoying  accidentally\nWes Anderson-like videos. Yeah. You know what I mean?\nYeah. Okay  say something\nin sort of a detached tone. Sitting on trains for two days wreaks havoc on your bowels. I'm feeling good this morning. I mean physically  terrible. I am on the brink of death. But game-wise? Feeling pretty good. If I can get all the way\nto Luxembourg  my options really open up  and then I should be able\nto just embed myself somewhere weird\nin my territory. 'Cause I think at this rate... No one's gonna make it\nto their end location. I think the winner is\ngonna be determined by where the Runner is\nat the end of today  at 8 pm today. Just a quick reminder: if nobody makes it to\ntheir end location  the win goes to\nwhoever's end location is closest to the current Runner\nat the end of three days. This is day three  meaning\nthat whoever's win region the Runner is in\nat 8 pm today will win the game. But that just means\nthat I have to get somewhere weird\nin my territory where they can't get to me. And I feel like I should\nbe able to do that. But... We'll see. Okay... hello.\nOkay. So... Ben has left Brussels.\nHe is headed  it seems  to a place called\nCharleroi[shar-la-roy]. Charleroi[cha-ta-rha]. He will get there at 7:30. Luckily  the train\nwe are on to Brussels continues on to  what is it? Charleroi[cha-ta-rha].\nYeah. And we'll get there at 8:30. So  we'll only be\nan hour behind him. That's good. We frankly have no idea... where he's going. I mean  he seems to be probably planning to chain\ntogether regional lines to make his way\ninto his territory  which to be fair is\na very smart move. You can't cut somebody off if you don't know\nwhere they're going. So... I think we just gotta\nfollow him for now. We're doing fine. We're doing fiiine. I had a dream last night that Sam and Adam fell down\na well  and I won. And when I went home \nthere was a parade... for me. And people were in the streets  they were crying...\ntears of joy. They were weeping. And Joe Biden was there  and he kissed me\non the forehead. And he gave me a big... key to the city. And Sam and Adam were\nstill down in the well. Was it a dream or\nwas it a premonition? Only time will tell. Okay. We are here in Charleroi. I have about 15 minutes to transfer onto\na train to Namur. There's my train. Okay. Off to Namur. We have news. He's going to Namur. Which... we thought he might do  and... We could've gotten off\nin Brussels and gone straight to Namur  and gained a\nlot of ground on him. But we didn't \nwe didn't do that. He has a lot of options\nfrom Namur. Well  most notably  he has a direct to\nLuxembourg. It would be cool\nto go to Luxembourg. I mean  I would\nenjoy going to Luxembourg. Yeah  we can take the 8:50.\nSo we can take the 8:50 and just be one hour behind. At a certain point \nwe can't be one hour behind  though. Yes  at a certain point \nwe do have to catch up. So  here's the situation. The situation is...\ninteresting. The situation is entertaining. It's good  suspenseful\nentertainment. And that's what we're\nhere for  right? This train to Namur\ngets in at 8:22. There is then a train\nto Luxembourg at 8:47. Which I don't have\nremotely enough... ...coins to take yet. If I can earn... a whole bunch of coins\nin 25 minutes and get on that 8:47... that means that I will\nhave bought myself... I think at least a\ntwo-hour lead in Luxembourg  which would be amazing. And if I don't make\nthat train  it means I'll probably\nget caught in Namur. So... I've just\ngotta pull a card as soon as I get off\nthis train  and... ...pray. Pray that it's something\nI can do really quickly. Okay  okay  we're in Namur. The train for Luxembourg\nleaves in 25 minutes. So  let's pull a card. Okay  I'm using the\nlast of my coins to... double this next card. And... I guess\nthe fate of my run and the fate of this game... sort of come down\nto what card I pull. Okay... here we go. Become a French chef. Become a French chef. Make mayonnaise. You must successfully\nemulsify egg and oil into at least one\ntablespoon of mayonnaise. That's gonna be\nhard to do in 25 minutes. (chuckles) Oh god. Ohh. Oh  the legs are burnin'. Oh  da legs are burnin'. There's a place called\nShop & Go over there. Oh  okay  eggs. Oil  oil  oil. Some kind of oil. Can I get oil out of\nsomething else? Vinaigrettes. Yeah  there's oil at\nthe bottom of this. That might\n(bleep) me up  but... I have no choice. Merci. Now I just have to emulsify. I just have to emulsify. Welcome to\nThe French Chef. Today we're going to\nbe making mayonnaise. Crack an egg into here. We're gonna get some oil. Yes. And then... we're gonna be\nextremely... vigorous about this. Egh. (breathing heavily) It's mostly paper\nright now. We're gonna pour\nthis out and try again. Egg. The oil. Hello  alright. We are in Charleroi. Ben is in Namur now. We remain an hour behind him. Basically... We need something to change. We need something to happen that slows Ben down\nin some way. Yeah  there doesn't\nseem to be much that we can really do... to get ahead of Ben.\nTo get ahead of him. It seems mostly down to... hopefully something\nmessing up on his side. So  hopefully \nwe're cutting to him vetoing a challenge  or not... Falling in a ditch. Yeah  or not\nhaving enough coins. Or dying. No. Of embarrassment \n'cause he does bad. Yes.\nYeah! Oh  okay. It spilled out. Oh dear. This is bad. This is bad. Okay  we're gonna... They're looking at me. We're gonna throw this out. Okay. Found a cup in the trash. We're gonna try again. Egg. Oil. The train's leaving soon. (panting) Okay. Okay  okay. I think that that is\nsufficiently emulsified. It's completely mixed. So... Oh  we're gonna throw\nall of this out. Okay. I'm cleaning off\nthe rest of the egg. Ugh. Ugh. Eh (bleep)  oh ew. Ugh. Ugh. Oh  I don't know how\nmuch time I have! I don't know\nwhat time it is. Ugh! Ohh. Okay  okay. Oh  it's still here. Pardonne. Merci. That's my train to Luxembourg! Looks like you didn't\nmake it in time  boys! We're going to a new country. The train to Luxembourg\nleaves in three minutes  and he is in the station. I do think he's gonna\ngo to Luxembourg. Which I don't love. I don't love that. Things aren't going great. (sigh) I'm gonna touch that wire. Yeah  I think\nyou should touch it. It seems to not— I don't think that's\nelectrical. (strained grunts) Couldn't get there. (bleep) yeah.\nTouched the wire. Nice. Let's get on the train. Ohh. (panting) I think we're leaving. Yeah. Yeah  we're leaving. Okay  let's freaking go. I have to finish washing\noff all my stuff. Oh  we gotta wash\nthe camera too. Okay  let's go find a seat. Looks all historic and stuff.\nOh  there he goes. Okay. Alright  well... I'm trying not to\nfreak out yet... but it does seem like he's\ngoing to enter his win area now. And it doesn't seem like we\nhave a good way of catching up. (silly grumbles) I agree. Alright  well... Welcome to Namur Station  where you just saw Ben.\nThank you. I was talking to the audience. Not you. Rude. Ben left \nwhat  18 minutes ago? But now we have to\nwait a half hour to get on a train. So... Welcome to Namur. It's a beautiful city full\nof construction mostly. Okay  so it is 9:48  and Adam just\ntweeted something. And that suggests to me that they just got on a train. Because usually\nwhat I do is I'll sit down on a train \na long train  and I'll pull up my phone\nand pull up Twitter. And that would make sense because there was a train\none minute ago... from Namur to Arlon. And if they got on\nthat train  they could get to\nLuxembourg by 11:50. So I'm gonna assume that\nthat's what they're doing. And so I just have to get out\nof Luxembourg before then. I think that\nshould be no problem. Welcome to Luxembourg! One of the toddlers\nin my car said  \"We're in Germany–France!\" And what is Luxembourg \nif not Germany–France? It seems like most of the routes\nI would take out of here go through a place called Metz. Already have enough\nbudget to get there. So I think what\nwe're gonna do is we're just gonna...\npull a card see what the deal is  and then hop on\na train to Metz. Sam... Ben is officially\nin the region where – were the game\nto end right now – he would win. Okay  he could get to Metz\non this train at 12:12. (chuckles increasingly)\nThat's way— That's a lot earlier\nthan we could. When could we get to Metz? I mean  we're not even\ngetting to Arlon until 11:30  and then we would need\nto take the train  and then we would\nneed to take a taxi  and then we would\nneed to take a slow regional train\nto Metz. Okay... If Ben gets on a train 14 minutes from now \nheaded south  then the game is potentially— Okay. If there— If Ben gets\non the train at 11:24... We are well and truly\n(bleep)-ed. Let's give them\na little shuffle  and then we will see\nwhat we're doing next. Cursed! You are now being\nRatatouille'd. The next move you make\nwill be decided by a rat. Please access the\nSmithsonian Zoo's naked mole rat live feed\nand go to Camera 2. Whatever direction you first\nsee a rat cross the camera  you must travel\nat least 2 miles in that direction\nbefore continuing. Okay  I have to access\nthe naked mole rat cam. And they're gonna decide\nwhere I'm gonna go next. I have to access Cam 2. Okay  so that rat\njust went that way. So I have to go west. Is Metz at least\ntwo miles west? No. No  it is not. So let's look at\nthe departure board and figure out what\nwe're allowed to take. Oh  okay  well  it's 11:25. Yeah.\nAnd he's still there. I feel like I'm just kinda setting myself up\nfor heartbreak here. Probably. Ugghhh... I've got a real— I've got a pit\nin my stomach. He's— It still says\nhe's in the station. Yeah. But why would— There's no reason he\nwould be in the station if he wasn't taking that train. There's not another\ntrain for ten minutes. Wasserbillig. What about Trier? That's in Germany. That's not where\nwe want to go. Pétange  that sounds French. It's in Luxembourg  but\nit is the right way. Okay. I think that's our\nbest bet for now. It's Pétange. Maybe the rat is helping me. Maybe this is actually gonna\nmake their lives harder. Okay  it's 11:30. Yeah. It doesn't\nshow him having left. I think he didn't take it. That seems conclusive. 'Cause it seems to be\nroughly live location. Okay  he definitely\ndid not take the train. Yeah.\nWow. That is a massive relief. Pétange. It's interesting. I mean  I never considered\ngoing to Pétange  but... This rat's... This rat's got an\ninteresting strat  because the rat was\nlike  just go west. You know? Don't worry about\nSam's win area. Adam's going next. All you gotta\nworry about is him. As long as you're going\naway from his win area  it's gonna make it harder\nfor him to get back by the end of the day. You've totally got a\ngood chance of winning  even if you get caught. I'm gonna trust\nthe rat on this one. I mean  I have to trust\nthe rat on this one. That's the challenge  but... Let's just hope\nthe rat's right. Where is he? West. What? None of this makes any sense. I think he's on that\nline that does that curved... Oh  he's on the curvy line. But that means\nhe's going to there. Yeah. Well  we could even maybe just take a taxi\nor something. Luxembourg is so small. Alright  well \nnow I think Ben's... I've gone from being worried Ben was about to\nrun away with it  to thinking Ben's actually\nin quite a lot of trouble. Alright  I've decided I'm actually gonna\nget off a little earlier. I've gone my two miles.\nI've fulfilled my curse. That rat doesn't know\nwhat it's talking about. I think that I have to\ngo back to Bettembourg  and then down back to Metz. It seems like I'm\ngoing to just get trapped if I... go to... all the way to Pétange. 'Cause there are just not a\nlot of trains out of there. Hopefully  I'm hoping that... me being kind of indecisive\nand going all around and having a rat factor\ninto the equation... will throw them off enough that they won't be able to\nstay right on top of me. If they're even right on\ntop of me  I don't know. It's a very\nnice train station. I just can't even\nfigure out where he's going. Cause he's in... Esch-sur-Alzette.\nHe's in Esch-sur-Alzette. We could take a\n20-minute taxi there. I mean  if we\nwere to take a taxi  we might as well take it now  but the problem is then\nwe're... potentially... In a place that\nthere's (bleep) nothing. Yeah. We might be\nstranding ourselves. Oh wait  no.\nThere is a train to there in... Oh  it leaves in two minutes. Wait  what? Yeah  Luxembourg to\nEsch-sur—(indistinct) Oh  okay. What train is it  Sam? It leaves in two minutes \nso 12:17? The Wasserbillig one? No  it's the one to Rodange. Rodange? 5AB to Rodange  great. So it's up here.\nWait  I don't— what? But that's a different departure\ntime than it shows here. Well  I don't know.\nThat's what it says. 5AB to Rodange.\nThis is 5AB. Well  yeah  but\ndoes it stop at the... Oh  yes  it does stop. Oh  that says out of order. \"Destination: Rodange.\" Yeah. Okay  the door closed on me. Let's do it. Now it shows him... north of that. Is he headed back towards us? Yeah  because it\nseems like he's just on the same line coming back. (whispering)\nJesus Christ. What is he doing? Okay  so I'm actually\ngoing to take this train all the way up to Howald  and then I only have to\nbe there for ten minutes before I can transfer\non a train down to Metz. Hopefully in that ten minutes  they don't realize\nwhat I'm doing. My hope is that they\nthink I'm going back up to Luxembourg Station. And since I'm getting\none station from there  and I'm only there\nfor ten minutes  hopefully they don't realize\nthat I stop in Howald and then go back down. And then hopefully by the time that I'm on that train\nback down... it's too late. Yeah  so I guess if we were\nto go all the way to Bettembourg  he might jump us on the tracks. It's possible. I mean  he left just a\ncouple minutes before us. Yeah. I mean  he's closer to\nBettembourg now than we are. Which means maybe we're going to get off at\nthis next stop here  so he doesn't jump us. We need to decide now. Let's get off.\nYeah  I think so. Okay  he's definitely\ncoming north. He is? Okay. So  search is on. Okay  okay. So we have to get on\nthe train and find him. The key is  I think we want— There's a high chance\nhe's trying to get off at the Luxembourg\nCentral Station. So we need to catch\nhim before that. Oh  it's double decker. Uh-oh. Double decker's tough.\nWhat if— Here  I'll take the top floor. You take the bottom floor  okay? Which direction do we go? Let's start at the back. And go to the front. Well  we need to\nexpose ourselves right now. What? Oh  we're basically\nat the front. Okay. I'll take the top \nyou take the bottom. Alright  well...\nNothing? He left. He left? Oh my god \ndid he get off? What if he saw us? There's no way he got off. Is that the station though? That's the station.\nThat's the station. If he got off  then that's\none of the biggest... gamer moves we've ever seen. Okay  I'm here in Howald. Hopefully they don't realize\nthat I'm actually stopped here. (sharp inhale) Fingers crossed. He's not on the train. He must have gotten off. Definitely  he's still there \nand it's showing live. We just got swerved. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Ben... what are you doing? Am I gonna pull it out? Is it gonna be a Ben victory? Well  the finale's\nup right now on Nebula. If that were true... then you could go watch \nright now on Nebula  the finale. Wait  what would you watch? You could go watch the\nfinale on Nebula right now if the finale was up\nright now on Nebula. Oh  no  no  no  Ben.\nGuess what? Guys  I just heard... The finale is up on\nNebula right now. I'm sorry \nI couldn't hear you. Wait.\nWait  wait. (whispering) The finale's\nup on Nebula right now. I don't really believe you.\nWait  what did he say?

        "transcript": "Hello  and welcome to the finale of\nTag Across Europe. At the end of the last episode  we came inches\nfrom catching Ben here in Howald  Luxembourg. We had boarded Ben's train \nthinking we had him trapped. But Ben  not even realizing\nthat we were in Howald  had gotten off on our\nplatform to transfer trains. Now  we're being sent\nback up to Luxembourg station\non an empty train  and he's about to hop\non a train that goes further into his region towards Metz and Nancy. There are just over seven\nhours left in the game  and it's still a toss-up. If none of us make it to\nour win location by 8 pm  then the win\nis going to go to whoever's region\nthe Runner is in at the end of the game. If we can catch Ben\nwithin the next few hours  then Adam might have\nenough time to make it back\nto his territory. So let's see if we can recover\nfrom this game-changing swerve. He's not on the train. He must have gotten off. He's definitely still there \nand he's showing live. We just got swerved. He must have\nseen us getting off. (sighs) You gotta respect that. When's the\nnext train from there? What's that station called? Oh no. What  is there a good one? Okay. There is my train. I'm getting on it.\nThe question is: Are Adam and Sam on it too? If they are  there's\nnothing I can do about it. Well  it's been a few minutes \nand I don't see Sam and Adam  so I think\nthat means that either they didn't realize that\nI was transferring trains  or they weren't in Luxembourg\nat all to begin with. Either way is very good news  'cause that means we're\ngetting pretty freaking far. Adam.\nYeah? He's on it. We just set him up\nperfectly for that  Jesus. I mean  that's pretty incredible. Oh man  just perfect\nconnection to the exact spot. Here's what I wonder.\nI wonder if he was just planning on\ntaking that transfer. But that train stops\nat Bettembourg  so we should've\njust gotten off there. Does it?\nYeah. Oh yeah  it does.\nYeah  weird. No  he must have spotted us. Well  I guess\nwe need to get on the next train to Metz then. This gets into Metz at 1:27. He'll have a 30-minute lead. 30 minutes  geez.\nSo ours is slower? Yeah  ours is slightly slower. Alright  well let's\nget to the platform. Wow! Damn. That is embarrassing. Wow! I mean  how can you\nhate him for that? I mean  it's just\ngood gameplay there. Yeah  uh-oh. It's fine. Once we get to Nancy  at least we'll be\ncomfortably in my territory. And then we can start\nplaying really unpredictably. And that is gonna be fun. We've already been playing\na little unpredictably  but it's because\nthere was a rat that was controlling my mind. This time  it will\njust be me for fun. Okay  see you in Nancy. Good bye  Luxembourg! We might actually\nalready be out it. It's pretty small.\nNo  we're not. Not yet. I checked. I can't believe that.\nI can't believe that. That's crazy that\nhe pulled that off. Yep. You gotta respect it. He's officially in France. (sigh) Bonjour to him. They speak French in\nLuxembourg  too  but... Okay  well... Bonjour to us. Yes. Bonjour to everyone  really  in a larger sense. Yeah. Except the... Except the\nChinese Communist Party. Yeah. Not bonjour to the\nChinese Communist Party. Not a fan.\nTo them  I wish them adieu. Okay  so now something\nkinda weird happened. While Ben was on\nhis train to Nancy  he found a train from Metz to a tiny town\ncalled Bar-le-Duc that only leaves every\nfour and a half hours. If he could catch\nthe next one and get himself\ntrapped out there  it would be almost\nimpossible to catch him by the end of the game. The thing is \nhe only found this route as his train was pulling\ninto Metz station. So he panicked and\ngot off his train  not yet realizing that he\ndidn't have enough coins to take the train\nto Bar-le-Duc  and that the next\ntrain from Luxembourg  which we happened to be on \nwas going to arrive before he could\nleave the station. Okay  I've gotten\noff my train at Metz. There is a train\nfrom here to Bar-le-Duc in half an hour. And there's not another\ntrain until 6:30. So if I get on that\nand I get to Bar-le-Duc  I think that they're gonna have\na really hard time getting there. I think I'm gonna be... kinda  I don't know. I'll be all posted up. I'm sorry \nI'm a little frantic. I just realized this\nall at the last second. I don't have enough\ncoins to get there. So I have to pull a challenge  and I have to be\nable to do it here. Okay  that's the situation. That's the situation. Okay. Cursed!\nFor the rest of your run  veto periods last\nthree times longer. I'm not vetoing it! I am not gonna veto that \nand in fact... I may not even have to pull\nanother challenge this game. So this might have saved me. Okay. Now I just have to figure out that train to Bar-le-Duc. Bar-le-Duc. Okay  it's not\nfor a little while. It's not until 2:06. So as long as they\ncan't get here  okay. Bleh. As long as they can't\nget here before 2:06  I'm getting on that train \nand then I think I'm safe. So the question is \nare they gonna get here? Oh (bleep)  okay. I have to do some research. I have to see\nwhere they could get. Oh  I'm shaking \nI'm shaking  I'm shaking. It looks... I mean  it's 1:33. Ben's train should've\nleft at 1:32  but it seems like he's\nstill in the station. Yeah  I mean  sometimes\nthese are tracker errors  but... I mean  it shows live. We'll see. Yep. I mean  we are gonna\nbe at Metz  where he is  in 20 minutes.\nMhm. Okay  so... I may have (bleep)-ed myself. If they can get here to Metz... before I get on that train... then... I'm finished. Because there are\nno other trains... that I can get on. But if I get on that train  I think I might win... there and then  pretty much. So  it comes down to this. Are Sam and Adam\nabout to arrive in Metz  or aren't they?\nI don't know. Well  he's still there.\nOhh  he's still there. He's still at Metz. We will be there\nin six minutes. Ben? I think— I think it's\nthe end of the line. I think that you're—\nHey  train pun! That was good.\nThat was good. Thank you. Adam  what are you\nresearching? Nothing.\nNothing? Nothing.\nYou're just on Twitter? Yep.\nOkay. What does Twitter say about\nthe train routes to Germany? Shut up. Adam... We are basically here. Mm-kay. Still shows\nhim in the station  so this could be a\ntricky search. And that also means that\nhe could be on a platform  or on a train that\nis about to leave. I guess\nI might as well hide  because there is a\npossibility that they are on that\nnext train to Metz. That does get here\njust before the train that I want to take. So  if they are on it  I guess I want to waste... as much more of\ntheir time as I can. Oh  there he is. There he is.\nHe's running. Where is he running? I see him.\nI'll go get him. Is he running to\nthe other platform? You sure you saw him?\nNo  I saw him. Is that him? Wait... I thought I saw him. Adam!\nYeah? On the tracker  he's that way. Okay. Just in case... Adam and Sam get here before my train to Bar-le-Duc... I'm gonna hide\nin this photo booth. I guess I might as well get\nsome photos while I'm here. Choisissez votre produit\nen touchant l'écran. Attention  ces photos\nne sont pas conformes pour les documents officiels. Souhaitez-vous continuer? I don't know\nwhat these words mean. It kind of looks like he's\nin this main hall over here. That train's not\ngoing anywhere  is it? He couldn't have\njust gotten on it. I mean  there is\na train to Nancy leaving in two minutes  but... On another—\nWait  where's that? I don't know. Oh  shoot! It looks like he's in here. Please look straight ahead. Ready? Three  two  one. Wait  wait  where's\nthe train to Nancy? Platform A. It leaves in two minutes. We need to get to\nplatform A. It kind of looks\nlike he isn't here. Okay  well  I think we need\nto get to platform A  though. 'Cause that's his only way out. Well  according to this \nwe passed over him. He's gotta be on platform A. He's gotta be on\nplatform A  Sam. It's platform A. Platform A? (camera snap) Please look straight ahead. I don't see him.\nI don't see him anywhere. That's platform A. Where is he? Is he up there? I'm gonna check up here. It shows him right here. Is he hiding\nin this parking lot? I mean  this is the exact\nlocation where it shows him. Your photos are printing. Please collect them\noutside the shade. Thank you.\nWe'll see you soon. Oh  wait. Okay. There's my photos. He's gotta be\nhiding somewhere out here. It shows him right here. I think we need to\nsearch elsewhere. I think we need to go down. Yeah. I mean \ntracker accuracy  it's— I mean  it's giving us\na really accurate position. It's giving us\nan accurate  live... But like  right here. I don't hear any\nfrantic sounding boys yet. Maybe we need to\nsee if there's a basement level or something? Yeah  I don't know. Or maybe we need\nto check the shops. Two minutes.\nIn one minute... In one minute  then I'm\ngonna run for the train. Okay  okay  here I go. (softly)\nI don't see them. And they would... probably be\nfrantically running up and down this train... if they were looking for me. (heavy inhale) Okay  we're leaving. I still don't see 'em. I think I\nmight have... phew... Think I might have made it. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.\nNo. No. No. What could he have taken? How did he—\nNo way. What did he get on? What just left? How is that possible? You checked the\nNancy train  right? I thought I checked it. It left five minutes ago. Yeah. What was after that? He is on a train...! (exhausted chuckling) (whispering)\nLet's goooo! How did he pull that off? What  where—\nOh my god. What other trains were there? I don't even know.\nI'm trying to figure it out. I really don't understand. We should have played\nmore defense on the trains. We should have just\nstood on platforms. Make sure he couldn't\nget on anything. Well  I mean... the Nancy one I thought\nwas the only option. Okay.\nI saw a regional line. I'm gonna put this here \nand you can stand. My arm's tired. I saw  I saw  I saw—\nIt went— I'll find where it went. No  I agree.\nI also saw that. Verdun  or something. No  but that goes north.\nThe train to Verdun leaves to the north.\nI checked that. There are no trains from here that go the direction he's going. What track is he on? I can't even figure that out. He's on the track\nthat goes to Paris. I think he's\ngalaxybraining it  and he's gonna get\nback to his territory through Paris or\nsomething  I don't know. This doesn't make any sense. And I haven't\nseen him stop yet. This doesn't\nmake any sense at all. A lot of his moves\nhave not made sense. Whoa. I just realized\na really good idea. I could put my mic\non my hat. Okay  this... This has to be it. Let me look. Yup. 2:06. That's it.\n(shudders) We can't get there until... We might have to go to Paris\nand then go the other way. The fastest way to\nget there is through Paris. Getting there at 6 pm. That is—\nThat is what he took. How did we miss that? I guess we couldn't\nfind it because there's... There's so few of them.\nThere's one every four hours. Well  why couldn't\nwe find it on here? Yeah  'cause I think we were\nlooking at the departures soon. And there's only one\nevery couple hours  so... That's 100%\nwhat he's doing. Okay. So... Hey  my sandwich.\nSorry. Okay  well  they're\nnot on this train. So I can get to Bar-le-Duc... without getting caught. I don't think Adam's\ngonna be able to get back into his\nterritory in time. Maybe he'll think of something if they catch me  but... We might have just been GG'd. (trills lips)\nI mean... I mean  I genuinely don't know if there's anything we could do. Maybe not. So  I mean  I think\nat the very least  it makes sense to\nhead down to Nancy. Okay  let's go to Nancy. It appears Ben has stopped. Well  there's\nactually quite good trains from Nancy to where Ben is. They're only an hour. Yeah?\nAnd there's one in— When are we gonna\nget into Nancy? I think 3:50-ish  maybe? 3:50? Around then  I don't know. Ah  shoot.\nThere's one at 3:35. Oh  no  we're\nnot gonna make that. Alright! Bienvenue à... ...Bar-le-Duc. So  we are now in my territory. And there are about\nfive hours left in the game. And Bar-le-Duc is\npretty good  to be honest. There are not a lot of\ntrains that go here. We're pretty in the\nmiddle of nowhere. When Sam and Adam\ndo catch up to me... Adam won't have any options. So... I'm kinda gonna\njust wander around and see Bar-le-Duc. Let's take a little tour. Is that a statue of\nLeon Trotsky? No  okay. Okay  so Ben is in \"Bar-de-Luc\". We can seemingly get\na transfer there. Yeah  we can—\nFrom Nancy. We can get there from Nancy. We would arrive around 5:40. Maybe there's enough time? He is... He is trapped there.\nPretty much. He has no trains\nto get out of there that don't just go\nback towards Nancy. Yeah. So  we are gonna\nbe able to tag him. The question is just: can I get back into my region? We are not far from my region. I don't think I have a shot.\nI could have— No  I don't think you do. Yep. Yep  okay. Welcome to Nancy. Well  good news  bad news. Bad news is that\nthe hourly trains to \"Bar-de-Luc\" leave four minutes ago. Good news  we have\n56 minutes here  where we can just\ncheck things out. We're sure\nthere's no faster way? Assuming Google is right. Next train to \"Bar-de-Luc\"? 4:34. Okay. ♪ Bar-le-doo-doot-\ndooo-do-doot-doo-Duc ♪ ♪ Bar-le-doo-doot-\ndooo-do-doot-doo-Duc ♪ ♪ Bar-le-doo-doot-\ndooo-do-doot-doo-Duc ♪ ♪ Bar-le-Duc ♪ Yeah  there's a\nlittle river here. That's pretty pretty. I'm gonna sit by the river. (exhausted groan) Well... There have been\nseveral times on my run where I thought that I had a sense of where\nAdam and Sam are  but... At this point \nI really gotta say  I don't know where they are. Seemingly... they got themselves in a\nmess of trouble  somehow. I think they\nwould have caught me... were it not for\nsomething unforeseen. But that's...\nhow the cookie crumbles. Oh  I would love a cookie. Well  welcome to Nancy. Thank you. I'm glad to be here in... Well  I was gonna say\nI'm glad to be here in Nancy. But frankly \nI would much rather be in \"Bar-de-Luc\". Yeah. Well  I mean \nin a more real sense  I would rather be\nin my region after catching him\nin Luxembourg. To get swerved twice in a row... Yeah  that's tough stuff. We spent all that time\non the parking deck. I mean  it showed\nhim right there! It's gonna look real\nembarrassing in the edit. It's not gonna be\none of our finest moments. No. Well  this is very pretty. Look at that. Look at that.\nWhat? Look at that.\nLook at that. Look at what?\nLook at that. Look at that. Oh  just look at\nthings in general? Look at that. Look at that.\nAre you calling me 'that'? Feels rude. Yeah. Look at that.\nLook at that. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that.\nLook at that. Look at that.\nThat's pretty... That's pretty slay. That's pretty... epic win. Right  guys? Should probably\ngo back kind of this way towards the station. So... We're about\n10 minutes away from Ben. But it's 5:20. How are your\noptions looking  Adam? Quite bad. Okay  hello. So  after looking at\nall of the arrivals and all of the departures going into \"Bar-de-Luc\"  at this point \nthere is no way... There is mathematically no way that Adam could get\nto his win area by the end of today. So... I don't have to go anywhere. I just have to sit\non this bench and take in the view and wait for Sam and Adam\nto get here  I guess. Let's see when they show up. Last train  probably. Welcome to Bar-le-Duc. A place that I'm sure the camera is intimately\nacquainted with by now. Yeah  Ben's\nbeen here for a while. Yep. Okay. Oh  very pretty looking. Ben seems to be\nwaiting somewhere this way. I like the things on the hill. It's very pretty here. Look at that! I don't think we\nneed to really worry about sneaking up on him. Nah  I don't think there's too much of a rush.\nHe doesn't seem very concerned. This has been quite the\nroundabout tour of Europe to end up... approximately 125 kilometers  less than 100 miles away\nfrom where we started. Yeah  we... We took the scenic route. Look who it is. There he is! He's not running. No  and I don't think\nhe probably needs to. (high-five clap) It's a nice little\nspot you got here. Seems like that's that. Well  Ben  as I imagine\nyou have figured out... I cannot get into my\nregion before 8 pm. No. (sigh) Which means... you are the winner\nof Jet Lag season 7. Yaaay! I didn't think it would happen  but then it did. Ben... I have something for you. Is it the trophy?\nBut it's not in there. Oh. It was under here all along?! The trophy was\ninside you all along! Oh my god.\nOh my god. It's on top of my head? Yeah  but now it fell\ninto your lap just now. Oh  it fell in my lap just now?\nYeah! Sam! That was a good game  Ben. I mean  you earned that win. There were some\nvery tight moments. Evading us\ntwo different times. I was wondering... I was sure there must have\nbeen some close calls  but I couldn't tell exactly. You couldn't tell where?\nWait  wait  wait. I had some\nguesses as to where— Wait  wait  wait.\nWhere did you— Wait  in Luxembourg?\nWhoa-whoa-whoa! Where did you think\nthere were close calls? Well  cause there was a weird— There was some thing\nwhere I got Ratatouille'd. Where I was like \nI'm gonna make it look like I'm going back to Luxembourg  but then actually I'm gonna\nget on another train. Wait  you don't know!\nThat is amazing. That is amazing.\nWhat happened? Oh my god  Ben!\n(guttural chuckling) The train that you were headed\non back up to Luxembourg? Ohh.\nYeah. That you got off? We got on that\ntrain at the station that you got off.\nThat you got off. What? We assumed you saw us. No. (Sam and Adam laugh) Well  here's the thing. We thought— We couldn't believe that\nyou had managed to see us! You could have made that\ntransfer one station before. Yeah  why didn't\nyou just get off earlier? I don't know. (giggles)\n(sobs) I mean  you\nanticipated our move. We were there for\nten minutes looking for you before you got on\nthe train to here. I wasn't sure. I was hiding in a photo booth. (wheezes) You wanna see—\nWait  in fact— I bet that we have\nfootage of the photo booth  'cause we—\n(laughs) Was it on platform one?\nI took this— Well no  it was down in\nthe station a little bit. What an incredible run. I can't believe\nthe photo booth thing actually did something.\nThat's crazy. We were there! Ben  you've just won season seven\nof Jet Lag: The Game. How do you feel? And you've been on\na lot of trains. I do genuinely feel...\njet lagged. (all cheering) Good bye!\nSee you in season eight! See you in season eight! Bye  folks.\nThanks for watching.

        "transcript": "We're at Tokyo Station. We're gonna play a 96 hour game\nof capture the flag across Japan. But it's 7 am \nso we gotta go  go  go! Oh  let's go  Scotty!\nOh my god. Okay  we have\nto go make our plan  but we're gonna cut to the sequence\nthat explains the rules now. Okay  the goal of\nthis game is simple: Capture your opponent's flag and return it to your territory\nwithout getting caught. The game will be\nplayed in three rounds. The first in Tokyo \nthe second across this region  and the third across\nthe whole country. Right now at the start of round one  both teams are at Tokyo Station. The area around here\nis a neutral zone where players are safe  but the rest of Tokyo has\nbeen split down the middle. This is me and my partner \nScotty's territory  and this is our opponents \nBen and Adam's territory. In each territory is a flag  which in this game is a\nrandomly selected item in a randomly selected\nvending machine. In this round  the flag Scotty\nand I are trying to capture is the third item in this\nkimchi vending machine here  and the flag Ben and Adam\nare trying to capture is the fifth item in this\njuice vending machine here. But it won't be easy. All players have trackers on them. And if they get tagged by an\nopponent while in enemy territory  they'll be sent back\nto Tokyo Station to wait out a 30 minute jail period. So now it's up to\nteams to figure out: How do they navigate Japan's\nfamously complicated rail network to get their opponent's\nflag and get back  all while evading their opponents? So I think the first\nthing we gotta do is just head into offensive territory. So we should figure out\nbasically maybe what the most efficient route\nto the kimchi flag is. That sounds\nlike a good plan. What if they follow us though? Okay.\nOkay. So we're here. So  okay. Whoa. We think that if we send one person\nimmediately to go defend our flag  and one person immediately\nto go attack... That's probably the best solution. Hopefully they're going\nto go together to attack. And then you are gonna go and start making progress\ntowards their flag. Yeah  and if you can buy me\nenough time to get there and back  then we'll have this\nround locked down. I don't think... that it's gonna be very easy\nto catch anybody in Tokyo. Yeah. So I think from\na strategy perspective  we just book it. Yeah  I think you're right. So I think we wanna get\non the Ueno-Tokyo Line. Okay. 'Cause that takes us south\nto Yokohama where our flag is. So I need to get\non the Ueno-Tokyo Line. There's one in six minutes \nand it's purple. So... Let's figure that out. Ueno... Taka— Takiwa. Okay. I can't seem to figure out\nwhich direction to go. So I think we're just taking\nthis for about 10 minutes or so. Yep. I'm just gonna get on this\nand see what happens. So what would we\nwanna do if he follows us? We just\ncontinue with the plan. Just bring on\na wild goose chase? Yeah. I'm not feeling too threatened\nby the chasing right now. So time to figure out\nif I went the right way. Went the wrong way. Went the wrong way  okay. Not great. It's confusing because\neverything is in Japanese. Ohh. I don't know what any of this means. Platform three. Is this the right train? Yes. I think? No  I don't know. No  this isn't right. It's a different blue line? Okay  so after that train  I have 40 coins.\nOkay. So I'm pretty much out. But of course we're gonna do a\nchallenge in Shinagawa  right. Yeah.\nOkay. Even though we haven't\nmade it to the flag yet  we have to get off\nour train now  because we're running\nout of coins. You see  in order to\ntravel in enemy territory  we need to pay for\ntransportation using coins. It costs 50 coins\nto go one mile  and all players started the\ngame with 250 coins each. If we want to earn more \nwhich we'll need to if we want to make it to\nthe enemy flag and back  we need to complete a\nchallenge pulled at random from this challenge deck. The trouble is  challenges can only\nbe done while in enemy territory. And if your opponents\ntag you at any point  they'll steal all the\ncoins in your bank. Also  if we can't\ncomplete the challenge  we'll have to veto it  which means we won't be\nallowed to take any form of transportation for 30 minutes. The good news is \nScotty and I are traveling together  which is a huge advantage. You see  if we do\na challenge together  we both earn the reward. But if we get on a train together  only one of us needs to pay for it  which means that by traveling\nand doing challenges together  we can pretty much\nmove twice as fast. Okay  so I'm\ngonna shuffle real quick. Pull a card and let's decide whether\nor not to get back on this train. Play Sake Pong. Play Sake Pong. Fill a cup with a diameter of\nfour inches or fewer with sake. In five or fewer attempts  throw a ball into the cup\nfrom a distance of six feet. You may place the cup\nat any height. The ball may be makeshift. If you do not succeed  this\nchallenge is automatically vetoed. If you're attempting\nthis challenge as a team  you must alternate attempts. We'll need to buy stuff for that. Let's do that here.\nI know where to go. Hey buddy \nI went the wrong way. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Oh  no. Oh no  I have to wait nine\nminutes for the next train. (groans) (bleep) Well  I really hope that\nit's taking Sam and Scotty a while to do their challenge. Alright  we're in it. This is exciting.\nI know  this is good. By the way  who are you? I'm Scotty. I run a channel\ncalled Strange Parts. It's nice to meet you  Scotty.\nYeah  it's good to hang out. Do you wanna be a team? I would love to be a team.\nOkay  we want to go up. I just dunno if it's open. Does not look open. Oh man. We are too\nearly on a Sunday. Should we go\ndown onto the street? I don't love wandering\naround this station endlessly. Okay  I need to\nget on the Sōbu Line. I think I found the right line. Oh god! I found the train \nbut it's too late  so I'm gonna take a different one. So I'm gonna check\non the green line. The Yamanote Line. I don't know what any of these are. Okay. I don't know what that means. Okay  I'm getting on the train.\nOkay  I'm getting on the train. Alright  we're on our way. So  there's the beer. Okay  so\nthere's definitely beer. Hold on  I think I see sake. There's wine. Is this sake?\nYeah  here we go. Okay  sake.\nWe gotta find cups. That's what I'm more worried about. Yeah. Ah  here. There are coffee cups. Oh  perfect  so we're good. Okay. Adam is headed back\nin our direction. Interesting.\nAnd Ben is headed  looking towards the flag. I've made it to Kinshichō. Kinsit— —si—cho. I've spent 200 of my\n250 starting balance... ...to get here. Which means I'm pretty\nmuch out of coins  which means that it's\ntime to pull a challenge. And hopefully it'll\nbe one that can get me quite a bit further\ninto their territory  towards their flag.\nSo  let's do that now. A little shuffle \nlittle shuffle  little shuffle. And then we're gonna pull\nour first card  which is... Stalk a bird. Stalk a bird. You must have a single bird\non camera continuously for five minutes. If you ever lose sight\nof the bird or have to cut  you have to start over. The bird must be alive \nand may not be caged. Let's go find a bird. Let's go down to the street \nout of the view of the ticket booth. 'Cause I don't think\nthey're gonna love this. For good luck. Mmm  delightful. Alright. So do you think you— I'm not confident in my throw.\nDo you wanna do this? I'm not particularly\nconfident either. I can try. You ready?\nYeah. Oh  that was close. It was really close. Oh  I see a bird. Okay  hold on. Okay  start the timer. Got the bird right there. Okay  don't go away  bird. Oh man  I do not love this. My hand-eye coordination\nis not awesome. Maybe take the glasses off. Slow down and breathe. Do you think\nunderhand or overhand? I did it overhand \nbut it's up to you. See?\n(chuckles) Oh! So we got two more  right? Okay  that was three.\nWe got two more. I do not have a\ngreat feeling about this. (sputters)\nOkay. I don't like how\nmuch energy this bird has. It's kind of hopping around.\nI kind of want it to doze off. No  don't hop around. Don't do that. Okay  now it's up there. Now it's up there. Chill  chill. Okay  that bird took off \nbut that was not the Ohhh! Mother–(bleep) No  no  okay. Oh  I can still see its tail. Oh  no.\nNo pressure. For all the money. Ready?\nGo for it. Oh god. Okay  that sucks.\nThat sucks. Okay  so it's 7:49. 7:49 is when\nour veto period starts. Okay. So  you know the other\nthing that sucks? Yeah? There are no\ntrash cans in Tokyo. Yeah. And now we are cursed\nwith a cup full of sake. Drink it. Bottoms up. I don't wanna drink sake\nat 7:00 in the morning  but you are welcome to. After that  I definitely\nwanna drink sake at 7:00 in the morning.\n(guffaws) Uggh. Well done. You wanna just give up? Do not move... bird. Just stay put for another minute. Please  bird. Please  I look so crazy. Ten seconds. Bird  just stay there. Oh no  stop moving around. Four seconds.\nCome on  bird. Okay! We got a challenge complete. Ben is off for it. So I think  pretty much I think\nwe have to go on the defensive now. Yep.\nBecause— But we have 30 minutes\nbefore we can do that. Yes  but I think\nour tactic needs to be: we tag the runner  reset it back\nto essentially where we started. Yep  I think\nwe have to do that. I don't think we have\nanother option. No  I don't think we do. So I've done the math. It's gonna take about 1 100 coins for me to get from\nhere to their flag. And I only have 800. So we're gonna have\nto do a challenge before we get to\nthe flag regardless. So I'm gonna pull another\nchallenge right here. Give them a... It's hard to shuffle\ncards with one hand. Okay  let's pull our next challenge. Become Totoro. Become Totoro. At a bus stop  stand\nholding an open umbrella above your head and\nsmiling for five minutes. We are near a mall  so I\nshould be able to buy an umbrella? That man has an umbrella.\nI can't steal his umbrella. Okay. In here there's a\ncouple little stores. Oh  I see umbrellas. Oh  let's (bleep) go. Oh  there we go. Okay  so we're going\non full defensive. Let's... where... Ben seems to have stopped. Yeah  so I imagine\nhe's doing a challenge. I would imagine that too. Hopefully he's suffering\nas much as we are. It's nice to have a\nlittle break this early. It is  I'm sweating bullets. (wheezes) Sam's getting\ndrunk in the meantime. It's not a challenge.\nIt's not a challenge. There's no rule\nagainst it  though. That is true.\nBottoms up! This is a really scary\nthing that I'm doing. Okay. That was five minutes. I don't understand\nwhy Adam is just hanging out in Tokyo Station. Maybe he's waiting for us. Wait  that wouldn't make sense.\nHe must be waiting for a train. Oh no  he's not hanging.\nHe's coming for us. Oh. Should we go on foot? What if we just walk\nnorth to the next stop? Man  that's sake is\nactually kind of strong. (wheezes) Alright  go for a\nlittle walkie walk? Let's do it. Let's go for a little\nwalkie walk  Scotty. Okay. Alright  we're going\nthe right way this time. Hello? Hey there.\nJust a quick update. They've been at a train\nstation for quite a while. I'm wondering if maybe they\nhad to veto a challenge. And if it might be worth it\nfor me to stop there. I'm just wondering.\nI'm gonna be at that station soon. You think maybe\nyou should go for them? I mean  maybe. But I guess  actually no. Never mind  never mind.\n'Cause if they had vetoed  they wouldn't have any coins to\nsteal  so it's hardly worth it. Yeah  just take\nthis opportunity. Take this opportunity\njust to get ahead of them. Okay  okay. Okay  sounds good. Good luck. He has continued\npast that station. What? Do you think he's going to the flag?\nWhoa  that's interesting. I do think\nhe's going to the flag. Interesting. I think he's probably\nright about now regretting his decision to continue. Yeah  that does— I mean \nhe doesn't know that we vetoed. He does not. But that's not the\nright move in this situation. It is not the right move. Okay  so I think we\nshould be wandering back towards the station now. It's crazy how... it looks so Japanese. (wheezes) It does look very Japanese.\nYeah. Okay yeah  so we\nwant the Yokosuka Line. There's one at 8:27 \nwhich is about eight minutes\nafter our period ends. Okay. Don't love that.\nVeto period. Not amazing. Let me see\nif there's another option. Okay. There is not another option. So I guess the only question is  will Ben escape from wherever he\nis right now before we get there? Yep.\nAnd we'll see! Un-blurry.\nGet un-blurry. Get un-blurry. I need to get on this train. This train is gonna take me very close to their flag. Okay. Here we go. Ooh  Ben is moving. Oh  he is? Yeah  so I guess we\njust wanna keep on this until pretty much the flag. Okay. It looks like Adam\nis at the flag now. Wow. Good luck  dude. I mean... I think he's about to figure out\nexactly what has happened. Okay  so I'm\nnow in Isezakichō... which is where their flag is. But seemingly that's\nuseless right now  because they are... They're not here. So... I don't know. Should I go back? Or should I just stay here\nas a deterrent? No  they're moving forward. They're definitely back\nin their territory. They're squarely on defense now. So... I don't really know\nwhat to do with that. Okay. So  I'm almost to their flag. It's only ten minutes from here. But it looks like Scotty and Sam\nare both coming after me. So I'm gonna call Adam and... have him find me some\nkind of escape route. Because if they can\nget into position before I can\nget that flag  then... Oh  it won't be good for me. Hey  buddy. Hey  so it looks like Scotty\nand Sam are coming after me. Yeah  yeah \nit does seem that way. So I'm ten minutes\nfrom the flag. I can just run there.\nI'm just gonna sprint there. Okay  great.\nBut I need to stake out— They're 50 minutes\nfrom the flag. So  you have a solid margin. Okay. Okay  I need an escape route\nand I need more coins. I'm gonna pull a\nchallenge right now. Okay. Okay  it's translate this card. Decode this card. You may use your phone to help\nyou decode this challenge  but you may not take\na photo of this card or use image translating tools. You may not ask others for help. Okay  I can't help you.\nI can't— Yeah  'cause I can't\ntake a photo of the card. Oh  we'll see what we can do. I'm gonna find you\nan escape route  okay? Yeah  look for escape routes. Okay  okay. Alright  I'll call\nyou when I find one. Bye.\nBye. Okay  let's take a look here. Okay  so... Going out north feels like a risk.\nThey're coming from north. So even though there are\nbasically two ways out north  they're probably gonna\nsplit up and take them. Oh  oh  oh  oh. Oh  he can go south. Oh my god. Oh my god  he can go south. Alright  I'm on my way\nto their flag. I'm pretty close. Wait  hold on.\nAdam's calling me. Hello? Okay  I found you\nsomething really good  so... Great. What you're\ngonna wanna do is... Don't go back to Tokyo.\nYou can go south. Don't go back to Tokyo. You can go south\naround Tokyo Bay and cross the midpoint\nfrom the bottom. Does that make sense? Cross the midpoint\nfrom the bottom. Yeah  that makes sense. I think I know what you mean.\nWait  through Chiba? Okay  I'm gonna\nsend you a screenshot. All you need is 750 coins. Okay  well that's\nhow much this one is. Okay  great.\nAlright  alright. Gotta go  'cause\nI gotta use the map. Yeah  yeah  yeah  okay. Well  I guess— (wheezes) I guess I'm gonna hang out here. I am starting to get worried  'cause Ben is getting\npretty close to the flag. The flag's down here\nin the corner. What are his options out of there? So  I mean  he has a few. Well  Sam  look at this.\nWhat if he just continues on? What if he just\ncontinues on down here? That's a problem.\nBut then he can never— Oh... So I wonder if we\nsend one person past him. Oh  that is bad. Yeah. I did not know about that. Yeah.\nThis little thing down here. That is a massive strategic\nadvantage for them. Yes. Yeah  so one of\nus should keep going. Okay. He's definitely going\nafter the flag now. This is gonna be very close. Alright  four minutes to Chiba.\nSo we're both getting off  'cause there's no way he can\nget back in four minutes. Okay. Okay  I've made it to\nthe vending machine. I just need to get the fifth item  which is this. So it takes... 1 000 yen. Oh. Oh  okay. And now... Okay. I got the flag. Now  I just gotta get back to our\nterritory without getting caught. How am I gonna do that? Hey. Okay. Okay  Adam  I've got the flag. Okay. They are— I mean  they're pretty\nmuch there  I think. Okay  they're—\nYeah  they're there. They're at Chiba Station  so... I mean... Is there any way out that's\nnot through Chiba Station? I could try to go through Chiba\nStation and avoid them  but... So there's Chiba Station  but then there's Hon-Chiba Station. Hon... Chiba. And you can just go\nfrom Hon-Chiba instead. There's a monorail\nright on top of me. Okay  that could be good. Okay  I'm gonna\nget on this monorail. And that takes me pretty close. So that's the\nsomething-something monorail. Okay.\nSo if he does get on that... we should get as quickly\nas possible within this station to that monorail. Does that go through here? It goes through here \nbut see right there? Yep. Here we go. Yeah  I think that's\nwhat he's doing. I do. Let's go find the monorail.\nYes. There  monorail exit. Central Gate. I think we should maybe split up. Okay. We're just gonna see\nwhat we can do here. There's no perfect strategy. No  no perfect one. Okay. But hey  look \nwe got the flag at least. Hey  that's good. Alright  I gotta go. I'm gonna get on this monorail. Alright  so the plan is  I'm gonna go on foot\nto this other station where Ben could maybe slip out of. It looks like he might—\nOh  man. Oh  it looks like he's\ngetting on that monorail. Okay  let me call Scotty. Okay  here. Down  only up  that way. Alright  I think I'm\nin the right spot. Hey  Sam.\nHey. Now his tracker's showing all the way to the\nmonorail station. Yep. Did you maybe want to\nget on the monorail towards that way to go\nto the other terminus? I was just gonna get on\nthe same monorail as him. Alright  oh  there's one\narriving on the other platform. My only worry is if he\ntakes that route the south. Maybe I need\nto go to Hon-Chiba  to cut him off from the south. Okay  I'm\ngonna try and book it. There's just one arriving\non the other side. Trying to make that one.\nYou can flank him on the south. I'll flank him on the north. So here's our plan: Right now  Scotty and I are\nboth pretty close to Ben. In this game \nwe're using photo tags. All we need to do to tag him is\nget a clear shot of him on camera. But there's a small\nsafe zone around the flag. Defenders can't walk into it  and attackers can't\ndo challenges in it. We are allowed to transit\nthrough the safe zone  but we aren't allowed to get off our\ntrain in the zone to go after Ben. So instead  we need to\ncut off all his possible exits outside the safe zone. Scotty's gonna take the\nmonorail through the safe zone to Hon-Chiba \nblocking his way south  and I'm gonna go on foot here  protecting both stations\nthat can take him north: Chiba and Chibaminato. Theoretically that will trap him. That is  so long as Scotty\ncan get on the monorail to Hon-Chiba before Ben. I'm trying to make it. So you're taking it\ntowards Kenchō-mae  right? Yes. I gotta hang up.\nOkay. I'll talk to you in a second. Okay. (breathing heavily) Okay  the monorail will\nbe here in three minutes. Okay  we're\nclose to him now. One more stop away. Oh  this is getting exciting. We have a chance here \nI feel like. Here we go. We'll see if\nwe see him on the platform. Hey  the monorail's\narriving right now. They've split up. Scotty is\ncoming after you  but... I don't know by what\nmeans he is  but he's— Oh (bleep)! Okay  here it is. I think it's gonna be on this side. No  no  Ben  don't get on!\nI think he's on the monorail! You think he's on the monorail? Scotty's on the monorail.\nScotty's on the monorail. Oh my god  okay.\nI gotta get outta here. Get outta there \nget outta there! Scotty's on the monorail. Okay  (bleep) Ugh  okay. Okay  okay. Now I can't\nactually get off  but... we can spot him. It's moving on. He was definitely\non the monorail! He's right here. I'm right on top of him. Is he here? Didn't see him.\nHe must be down below. Very interesting. Ben  you're good  you're good. Oh my god. Okay.\nYou're good  he kept going. He went past you.\nHe went past you. Okay  okay. Okay  we gotta figure\nout a way out of here though  'cause he's about to go\nstation himself at Hon-Chiba. So  the next stop is\nthe one I can get off at  at the end of the line  so... I think we'll then\ntry and pinch him? I don't know. This gonna be a little tricky. Well... now we play the waiting game. So Ben  it's down to you. Make your next move. We're ready. Since we're in a\nbit of a stalemate here  I'm gonna just\ncomplete my challenge  which I think I should be\nable to do pretty quickly. So I found a website that\nlets me draw Japanese symbols. And so hopefully I can\ntranslate it this way. I'm not very good at drawing. And then there's a\nlittle house down below. Oh god  I hope it knows\nwhat I'm trying to do. Wither. No. We're just gonna move on. Uh-oh. This might mean tree or wood. Humanity? Might mean virtue. I'm just gonna try and\nget all the simple ones  and see if I can piece it together. Oh (bleep). Ben is now out\nof the neutral zone. But he's far enough\naway from here and close enough\nto the neutral zone that if I go after him right now  he could pop back in\npretty immediately. So  I don't think\nthat's the right move. I think I wanna maybe hang\nout on this intersection to see what he does. So we're playing a bit of\na game of chicken right now. Scotty and Sam are posted up in\nmy two main escape routes. And to make matters worse... I'm pretty sure that the challenge\nI pulled I can't actually do. So that's fun. So I have to veto it. I don't think that\nthey'll come for me. I think I'll be safe  but... I don't know what I'm\ngonna do after that. I don't know\nwhat Ben is doing. He might be doing a challenge. I think I'm gonna go\nup to the next station. Put some pressure on him. Okay  man  he's only\ntwo blocks away right now. But he's still so close\nto the neutral zone. I feel like if I get any closer  he's just gonna\nrun back into it. Okay  there's a train arriving.\nI'm gonna let Sam know. Hey. Hey  I'm going to Chibachuo  'cause he is just hanging\nout outside the station. I think that makes sense.\nApply more pressure. Okay  getting on the train now.\nI'll call you when I go. Yeah  but I think I'm gonna\nstay at the intersection I'm at  'cause I don't want him to retreat\nback into the neutral zone. And I think if I go\nany closer  he's going to. Okay. I'll talk to you in a sec. Okay  he's still in the same spot. No movement. Oh (bleep) The (bleep) is it? There's a map error. Oh crap. Did I get on a— Oh no! I think I got on a Limited. Oh  this is a huge problem. This is a huge  huge problem. Okay  so here's the problem. Scotty thought he was getting\non a train that was gonna stop here at Chibachuo  where he'd be right on top of Ben. But this train doesn't\nstop at Chibachuo. It goes all the way back to Chiba. That means the south escape\nroute is now wide open. If Ben realizes what happened and gets on a train at\nChibachuo before we catch him  he'd be able to slip right past us. Oh no  I got on a limited-stop. It didn't stop there  crap. I think Scotty might have\naccidentally overshot Chibachuo. Alright  I'm gonna\npick up the pace. Apply pressure. I think Scotty might have\nmessed up a little bit. Yeah  'cause he's back at Chiba. Alright  I don't want\nBen to get away. Wait  wait  Sam's moving. Oh (bleep)  okay. Seemingly  he has decided\nto end the game of chicken. He's going after Ben. I'm gonna call him. Come on  Ben.\nPick up  pick up  pick up  pick up  pick up  pick up  pick up  pick up.\nSam's after you. Pick up  pick up  pick up  pick up. According to this \nBen hasn't moved. Which doesn't make sense. So  I'm just going fast\nto see if I can... get him before he realizes. Okay. I just looked at the map. And Scotty's actually really \nreally  really  really close. I think I... No  I don't see him. So I'm gonna get back\ninto the safe zone. No  actually... If I go back into the\nsafe zone  then I won't be counting down my veto period. And I need to do that. So we're gonna go... hide. We're gonna go hide. Hey  you went to Chiba? I made a serious error \nand I managed to get out. No worries  I figured it out. I'm going after Ben so he can't get back to\nChibachuo  given that. Oh (bleep) Parking garage. Just need to get somewhere... he wouldn't expect. He's over here. He's definitely over here. I can get him. He's somewhere over here. Benjamin Doyle! Ohh... good game. Ooh  that looks nice.\nHere's your flag. (dial tone) Son of a (bleep) Scotty  I have a\nmessage from someone. Hi  Scotty. Hey  how are you? I'm about to take\na sip of the flag. (chuckles exhaustedly) Oh  it's delightful. Hello. Welcome  welcome to our zone. Yes. Welcome to\nour land in the north. Very hospitable. With Ben caught  he has\nto head back to Tokyo Station to wait out his jail period  which also happens to be the\nsame direction we want to go  in order to get back\non the offensive and make another run at the flag. Bye  Ben.\nGood luck  gents. You're gonna need it. Right. So we just passed Tokyo Station  and we're headed back\nto Shinagawa  where we started this morning  to do essentially\nthe same thing again  hopefully with an easier challenge. Basically  what we're saying is everything that you've\nwatched so far is worthless! (laughs) Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus If you wanna see an episode\nthat actually matters  make sure to come\nback for episode two. Because in that  you get\nto see who wins round one  and you can watch episode two\nright now on Nebula. Nebula's also\nhome to The Layover  which is our aftershow podcast where we recap each\nepisode with Scotty. We talk through our\nstrategy in more depth. We go into the rules\nin a little bit more depth  give you behind the scenes \nstuff that we cut. It's a fun time and it's\nonly available on Nebula! Comes out every week  and tens of thousands of\npeople are listening to it  'cause it's so good.\nPretty cool. And Nebula's got  you know  a massive catalog\nof other Originals from other creators that\nyou already know and love. It's actually one of my\nmost used streaming sites  and I don't even watch Jet Lag. I spent this whole— He's— You've never seen it.\nNo  I've never seen— I hear it's good.\nYeah. But I spent this\nwhole trip watching Modern Conflicts by RealLifeLore  who was our guest on season two. And I just had it\ndownloaded on my phone and watched it the whole time. It's  I mean  yeah \nit's a great deal  and... it's also a great\ndeal for the creators. Yeah  and what's\ncool about it is there's actually a ton of people. Around 100 000 people\nwatch Jet Lag early on there every single week. So there's a huge\ncommunity of people discussing and\nwatching the episodes and doing fan art and memes\nand stuff all one week early. So it's kind of the best\nJet Lag viewing experience  especially you know  given\nthe podcast and everything. Yeah  the cool thing\nabout Nebula is it was actually\nco-founded by myself and a bunch of my creator friends. We got together and we basically\nwanted to make a streaming site that was a better\nexperience for the audience and a better experience\nfor the creators. Like the best of both worlds. And part of what does\nthat is for the audience: it's ad-free  there's no\nalgorithms getting in the way  and there's all sorts of exclusive\ncontent and early content. And then for the creator \nthere's a lot of benefits. Like  for example  we actually get\na portion of the subscription fee of people who sign up\nusing our link forever. So that gives us stable \nrecurring monthly revenue that we can reinvest into the show\nand make it bigger and better.

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nto episode two of our four-day game of\nCapture the Flag across Japan. We're still in round one \nwhich means right now  it's just Capture the Flag\nacross Tokyo  but trust me  it'll get bigger. In this game  teams must use Japan's notoriously\ncomplicated rail network to go into enemy territory \ncapture their opponent's flag  and return it to their territory \nall without being caught. That's what Ben was\nup to last episode when I caught him  sending him\nback to Tokyo Station to wait out a\n30 minute jail period. My partner  Scotty and I are\nheading to enemy territory so we can do\nchallenges  earn coins  and fund our run to\nBen and Adam's flag  which means that by coincidence \nwe're taking the same train as Ben  making him the first guest\non our brand new  totally not derivative\nsnack review show. Adam  we have stolen your teammate  and now we're gonna indoctrinate\nhim into our snack show. We happen to be on\nthe same train  so... Ben  I would like to welcome\nyou to this special edition of Choo Choo Chew! This feels very derivative. It's a better name. Today on Choo Choo Chew!  we have for your pleasure  a kiwi chia seed drink. Ooh.\nIt looks fun. It's very pulpy. How many choos out of chew? Mm  choo-choo. Hey buddy. He got me.\nHe gotcha. Alright. Back by the flag  back on defense. Bye  Ben.\nGood luck  gents. You're gonna need it. Right. With Ben now at Tokyo Station  he has to wait out\n30 minutes of jail time. That means we have 30 minutes to get enough coins to\nmake our run at the flag before he can hunt us down. So we better hurry. Alright. Welcome back to\nShinagawa  Scotty. I want that\none right there. Find three new friends. Find three new friends. Find three different\nspecies of living  non-bug  non-bird \nnon-human animals. You must clearly\ncapture them on camera. That's not too bad. I can do that. Yeah  we can do that.\nAlright  let's do it. Okay  there's a\nShinagawa Central Garden. Okay.\nRight near here. Gotta get your steps in  Scotty! Oh god! But I'm old! Adam is still at the flag. Freaking camper. I know  what's going on? He's gotta be getting\nbored by this point. Maybe he's eating noodles. There's a bird \nbut bird doesn't count. Bird doesn't count. I think let's go to that garden.\nFind some squirrels and stuff. They have\nsquirrels in Japan? I think so? Hello? You have a dog? Dog  please. I'm not loving this  Sam. No.\nWhere's all the dogs? And the squirrels? If this was China  we\ncould just go to a Walmart and we'd be done in five minutes. Knowing how\nmany birds there are. I can't believe\nthere's no squirrels. It's just so disappointing.\nNot a surprise. There is an aquarium nearby. Ooh  let's do that. It's a 12 minute walk though. Okay.\nIt's not nothing. That might\nbe worth the time. Okay  so I have a while\nbefore anybody gets here. There's basically three\nways into this area  probably less than\na mile between them. So I'm just gonna go visit\nthem and familiarize myself so that when they do\nstart to get here  I can handle it. That's all the prep I can do.\nI'm gonna wait in the middle. Maxell Aqua Park. It seemed like it was in here. Oh  there's a movie theater. Oh  here.\nYep. Here's one. Sam  there's two species in here. Well  I think\nwe're gonna see plenty. Here  fish. Definitely fish. I don't know if we count fish as\none big species or not  but... No  it's... Fish is not a species  Sam. Sam  explain to us\nwhat a species is. It's kind of like a breed. It's kind of like a breed. It's not really a breed. Whoa! It's like Disney World. Half of the challenge is getting\nout of this fricking maze. Look! Jellyfish.\nJellyfish. Aren't species the ones that can... Yes.\nNice. Dolphins! Do a jump. Do a flip. Do a flip. Do a flip. Do a flip. Sam  sharks! I'm trying to get outta here. This is kind of like\nthe worst nightmare. The entire dolphin\nshow just let out. Time to exit through the gift shop. Alright  so back to Shinagawa. How many did we earn?\nI was amazed  750 each. That feels like\nit was underpriced  but... Well...\nI'll take it. Alright  I am\nback in the game. Sam and Scotty are\nstill at Shinagawa... I guess  doing a\nchallenge or something  so I can get there very quickly. And I'm just gonna hop on\nthe first train outta here and start putting pressure on 'em. Maybe I could steal my coins back. That'd be nice. I earned those. It looks like Ben\nmaybe just got on a train. In which\ncase we should move. In which case we should\ndefinitely move very quickly. He's in the station\nsouth of Tokyo Station. Yeah. Which doesn't make sense\nif he's doing a challenge. Because that's in the neutral zone. So I think he's\nprobably coming for us. Okay. In which case \nmaybe we wanna split up? No  I think we\njust get on a train that doesn't have a Ben on it. Alright  here  pull a card. Pick a card  any card. Oh  paint or draw\na local landscape. Paint or draw a local landscape. You must use at least three colors. You must cover at least\n75% of the canvas. The painting does\nnot need to be good  but it must be reasonably\nrecognizable as the landscape you're painting. You must spend a\nminimum of 15 minutes in a single location\ndrawing/painting. If you move  you may restart. That is gonna take some time. That is one to hang\nonto for a little while. Yeah. That one's not great. I don't love that.\nIt's not great. What line do we need\n'em to be on now? Yeah  if we're going\nstraight to the flag... Oh  I guess we can take this and then go on foot. But Adam's gonna be\nable to cut us off. Okay  so it looks like\nthey're back in the station now. The question's gonna be \nwhat time do they leave? Because they have a\nlot of options here. And I don't know...\n(nervous laugh) which one they're gonna take. Oh  look. Ben's coming after them. They're gonna have to\ndo something! Ben is on his\nway to us right now  so we should move  move  move. Okay  lemme just\nmake sure this is right. Is that right? Yeah  Keikyū Main Line.\nYep. ~Wait  I'm not a hundred\npercent sure this is right. ~It is not. We're going north. How did—\nI don't know what— I don't understand how we mess— I mean  this actually\nmight work in our favor. Let's go back to Tokyo. Yes? And then\ntake something fast. I guess. I suspect Ben is\nvery confused right now. Okay  so I just got off\nhere at Tamachi Gateway... because it looks like Sam\nand Scotty started heading back the direction I came. What could they be doing?\nWhere could they be going? I don't know what to do. Okay. They turned around\nand went backwards. I'm going to Shinagawa\nto meet up with Ben. There's no point in\nme waiting back here. I can get to Shinagawa\nin 20 minutes. So  that's the plan. So what is\nour plan though  Sam? So the plan is we're\ngonna get off the last stop before Tokyo Station  get stationery supplies \nand then evaluate from there whether we have the time to\ndo the 15 minutes of drawing. Based on what\nBen does  basically. Okay  I don't know\nwhat they're doing  but I'm just gonna\nget on the first train going back their direction  just so that we can keep\nchasing them around. And... hopefully we'll just figure it out. Yeah  that'll work.\nWe'll just figure it out. I love that plan. Here we go.\nHere's a black one. Here's a highlighter.\nI think that's good. Do you want to navigate us to\njust outside of the neutral zone? Yep. Because I think that's\nwhere we want to attempt this. Yep. So that we can abandon\nand dip back in if we need to. Go through here?\nOh yeah  that works. Ooh  this is fun. Oh  yeah. Alright  so Ben is... Ben's hot on our tail. Is he?\nYeah. Okay. Well  let's go hang out right on\nthe edge of the neutral zone then. Yeah. Okay. So they're right outside\nof Tokyo Station  I think right outside the\nneutral zone  doing challenges. So... I'm gonna leave... and... go after them. Should hopefully at least\nmake it harder for them to do whatever it is\nthat they're trying to do. The edge is right\nthere  basically. Okay  we need to start it quick. Okay. Okay  you can't\neven really see  but they're right\noutside the neutral zone. Down this way. Obviously they know I'm here. But... all I can do is... go towards them and follow them and see where they're headed. Okay  it's pencil. So does that count as\ndifferent than black marker? Eh... Do you want me to go get\nanother color just to be sure? Sure. Okay  I'll be right back. It seems like they're\njust down this street. I'm gonna put my phone\naway and just run. Scotty! Come on in. Come on in the neutral zone. He's coming. I'm right on top of them. Where are they? I think he's right on\nthe other side of the street. Yeah  yeah  come on  come on.\nQuickly  quickly  quickly. This was the line.\nOkay. So we're good. Yeah  so considering that  I think we should\nhead to Tokyo Station. Okay. 'Cause we're gonna need\nto probably take a train out to complete this challenge. To build the time to do it. Okay. Okay  so let's walk that\nway towards Tokyo Station. Are they down... here? They might be down here. I'm gonna guess that\nthey're down here. Let's see... Let's see if I can go down here. Okay  so... That didn't work.\nAnd Ben is right around here. And  you know  looks like— Oh  sorry  shades need to go on. Looks like Adam has\ndecided to join the game. Yes.\nHe's in Shinagawa Station. You know  one thing that\nwe could consider – it's a little bit high risk – is taking a Shinkansen outta here\nto the northern Yokohama stop. Just so you know  the Shinkansen \nalso known as the bullet train  is Japan's super high-speed \nsuper limited-stop line. If we could get past Adam on it  we'd be on a rocket to the flag. I like that idea. The only problem though is if Adam's in... We wouldn't wanna do that\nif Adam is in Shinagawa  because then he would pretty safely\nbe able to figure out where we are and probably get on the train. But would he know\nthat we're on a Shinkansen? Not necessarily\nwith confidence  but he could figure\nit out pretty quickly by the fact that the train\ndid not stop before there. If he's at Shinagawa  I think we're basically\nhave a free pass through. I don't think he's gonna\nbe able to figure it out. In a way  we're just\nwaiting to see what Adam does. But yeah  let's at least\nget to the Shinkansen's stop. Yeah  I think\nthat's a good next move. Alright. Okay  so Adam... it seems like they're\nback in Tokyo Station. Okay.\nSo... I mean  I could try and go out. I can't tag them.\nI could try and go after them. But even that \nin this station  it seems... less than likely\nthat I'll find them. Okay  so...\nSo what should we do? Okay  here's\nwhat I think you do. Follow them.\nTry not to be seen. See if you can find out\nwhat train they get on. Then you could tell me \nand then I could get 'em. I would try to find them \nand if you don't  then you've only wasted\na few minutes anyway. Okay  alright.\nI'm gonna head that way. Okay  sounds good  bye. Alright  while I wait \nI'm buying a gachapon. Whoa  you can get a lizard? That's pretty awesome. Here we go! It's so hard to open. Alright  back\nto Tokyo Station. Yep. Oh  here we go. This way. Okay  so... Sam and Scotty are\nsomewhere in Tokyo Station. The tracker is just\nnot that precise  so... It's not gonna help me a lot. Again  I can't tag them in there  but I can at least\ntry and find them and figure out where\nthey might be going next. This way. Straight ahead now. Seems like they're right here. They've gotta be\nsomewhere in this room. I'm looking for Scotty.\nScotty's very easy to spot. He's tall and ginger \nlike a giant beacon. No  no  now they're back this way. Simple thing.\n15  over here. So question is \ndo we wanna get on this? That's a good question. So Adam still is in Shinagawa. Seemingly. I still think we're\ngonna breeze through. I don't know. It is a choke point. I don't think he's gonna\nbe thinking Shinkansen. They on a platform? What track is that? Are they on the Shinkansen? It looks like they're on\nthe side of the station that serves Shinkansen trains. Yeah  we have three minutes\nto decide whether to get on this. I think we\njust roll the dice. Agh. I don't think he's\ngonna catch us on this. I mean  so... You just want to roll the dice? I mean  I feel like this\nis a predictable move. I don't think he's\ngonna be able to figure out what platform to get\non  and it's fine. Yeah  this rocks. I'm gonna name him... I'm gonna name him Chris. Oh  I'm getting a call. Hello? Adam  I think\nthat they're on the— I think they're on the side of the\nstation that serves the Shinkansen. So see if you can do anything\nwith that information. Side with the Shinkansen.\nGot it  got it  okay. Okay  sounds good  bye. Okay... No time for this. I'm gonna go station myself\nover by Shinkansen lines. Alright  let's go. Shinkansen. Let's do it. You just roll the dice?\nYeah. Alright  rolling the dice. So  this is definitely\na roll of the dice. I just have faith\nthat this is gonna be really hard to figure out. These are the Shinkansens. They would be headed\ntowards Ōsaka. Yeah  I don't love this. I don't have\na great feeling about this. I have a good feeling. You have a good feeling about this?\nGood feeling. Oh  they're on the move. Oh shoot  they're on the move! Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay. When did they leave?\nWhen did they leave? Just now. Okay. Yeah  yeah  I see they left.\nYeah  yeah  yeah. They're on the Shin-Ōsaka. They're on the Shin-Ōsaka. I gotta figure out which one. That wouldn't be them. That wouldn't be them. Okay  okay. Okay  so Adam is\nstill in Shinagawa. Yep. So... this is definitely a gamble. Yeah. (grumbles) Okay  well let's see if\nhe's on the platform. We'll be able to tell\nif he's on the platform. And maybe if he's on the\nplatform and he gets on  then we both get off. Theoretically. And then he's stuck on a\nShinkansen for the next 18 minutes. Shoot. I guess we could try to\nspot him from over there. Yeah  let's just\nlook out the window. Well  maybe we should get\nat the door and try to spot him. Okay.\nAs we roll onto the platform. Okay  okay. I'm almost positive they're gonna\nbe on a train coming in here. Okay  I'm taking my hat off\nto be a little less recognizable. Alright.\nWhy is this better than looking out the window? Just 'cause this way\nwe can pop out immediately. Okay. Okay  I'm pretty sure their\ntrain's gonna be coming here. There it is. Okay. Now here's the question. Do they get off it? Oh  this is going way fast. Haven't seen him yet. Haven't seen him yet. There he is. I just saw him. Oh (bleep). I saw them! I saw them. I saw them. I saw them. I saw them filming. Okay  well we need to pop off. Here  Scotty  hurry up  hurry up. Okay. I have to see if they get off. Ready?\n~So  we need to hop\noff at the last minute. ~Hop off and hide. I got 'em  I got 'em! Hello  gentlemen! See you later! Well...\nI thought we— Whatever  I'm not gonna discuss it. Yeah. Hello? Hello? I got 'em. I got 'em  Ben. You got 'em? Okay. I'm working\non getting to you. We're gonna travel together \nmake a run for it. Boy  he's\nhad some caffeine! Well  he hasn't been\ndoing anything all day. (cackles) Oh my god. This rocks  okay! I'm gonna have Ben\nmeet me on this train. We're gonna do the attack together. Hell yeah. (chuckles deviously) Okay  alright  welcome\nto Shin-Nihombashi. Adam is gonna get here\nin 20 minutes  and basically all we need is\none challenge's worth of coins to get all the way \ndo the full run. While Adam heads here  I'm gonna see if I can\njust get a challenge done. I'm gonna have to\nshuffle with one hand. Okay  shuffle  shuffle  shuffle. My card is... Get a snack on a stick. Get a snack on a stick. It must be on the stick\nwhen you buy it. Let's see if\nwe can do that here. No. None of those are snacks on sticks. Okay  okay  okay  okay. This station does not seem to\nhave a lot in the way of snacks. Note to self:\ndon't do that again. Yeah  that was\na good learning lesson. Yeah. Yeah  part of this is \nnot having played this before  it's a little bit\nhard to figure out some of the real minute\nreal-world interactions of... Yeah. How hard is it gonna\nbe to catch somebody and stuff. Yeah.\nBut lesson learned. Harder— Easier than I thought. Yeah. Okay  okay  this... This is definitely\na snack on a stick. Okay. Snack on a stick acquired. Alright. Train is here. Gonna get on. Feeling good. Hey buddy. I can't believe that we're here... ...in The Snack Zone! ~This is bad. (wheezes) Alright  so that was not rad. No. No  I am kicking myself here. Yeah.\nIt was a learning lesson for someone who's never\nplayed the game before. Learning experience.\nDon't need to dwell on the past. Have you checked\nwhere they are recently? Seems like they're moving.\nOh  they're on a train now. Uuuugghh. That's not... so not rad. Here's the issue.\nA little ways away. Adam... got a lot of coins.\nHas a bunch of coins. And the real issue\nis the fact that— is the geography.\nYeah. Where they can just\ncontinue to outrun us all the way to there. What are our\noptions right now? So at a certain point\nin the day... there is a strategic\nadvantage to kind of cutting our losses\nfor this round  because our coin balance\ncarries over to the next. Yep. So if we think that\nthey're gonna get this  there is some logic to just\nkind of letting them do it  and doing some challenges\nto earn the coins to be able to set ourselves up for\na really strong start next round. I don't emotionally love it. I don't emotionally\nlove it either. But  I do see\nthe raw logic in it. Yeah  you gotta look at the logic. Okay. I also don't love it.\nIt feels wrong. Yeah  it doesn't\nfill me with joy. Especially cause we\nwere on top of the world just 30 minutes ago.\nI know  I know. But on the bright side  we will be able to\nstart next round strong. Yes. Alright  so I... The tracker could be wrong  but it looks like they've\nleft Tokyo Station. And they're probably\njust doing a challenge. I think they've given up. I think they've realized\nthat they can't catch us. Which... they are right about. Yeah. I mean they\ncould've gone after us  but what they're doing\nseems pretty smart to me. We don't have to go back. We can just go around. Yeah  their chances of\ncatching us are so low... That it makes sense\nfor them to just get a head start in the next round. So  I think we might have\nround one in the bag. So basically the next hour\nis just us doing challenges. But because you already know\nwho's gonna win this round  let's just summarize. Scotty and I went to a lovely\nspot to draw our landscape  which turned out... fine. Then pulled our next card  which required us to kawaii-ify\nten of our belongings  making them adorable by\ngiving them eyes and mouths  which I think you have\nto admit  we nailed. Then we pulled\nPlay Pocky Hockey  requiring us to hit\na piece of Pocky into a Pocky box\nwith a Pocky stick  which we also nailed. If by nailed you mean\nonly made it on our last attempt\nbefore force-veto. All of which put us both\nat a healthy 3 250 coins. Meanwhile  Ben and Adam\nmade it to the flag. Adam left Ben behind\nto run and grab it  because you know  I don't\nreally need to explain that. Brought it back  and\nthen had to wait a while for their train to victory  so figured they should\nalso do some challenges. They pulled Go Super-Saiyan  requiring them to gel\ntheir hair straight up  which looked amazing and\nearned them 750 coins. Kamehameha! Then they had to make sushi  which for reasons\nbeyond comprehension  they did with bacon filling\nand dried squid on top  which no surprise \ndid not taste amazing  though it did bump them up\nanother 1000 coins a piece. It's so bad! Then their train came \nthey got on it  and round one was over. Hey! That's round one in the bag. That's round one\nin the bag  baby. Never count the boys out. Never count the boys out.\nIt's so important— We saw you counting\nthe boys out earlier. We saw it \nand we've heard it. And we said  we're gonna teach\nyou not to do that anymore. And I hope you\nlearned your lesson  because we just secured round one. And here we are.\nI feel so good. Nagaura. You ready to turn\nback around and go to Tokyo? Yeah  that's gonna\nbe a bit of a journey. Let's inform Sam and Scotty that\nthey have lost the first round. Well  we may\nnot have won this round  but I think we're\nsetting ourselves up for a pretty good position\ngoing into the next round. We definitely should not mention\nwhat we've been doing to them. In particular  we don't want them\nto know how many points we have. Adam says  \"Halt your challenges.\nFirst round is complete.\" Alright. GG  boys.\nGG. We'll get you in the next one.\nYeah. Okay  so Ben and\nAdam won round one  which gets them one point. But round two is bigger  better \nand crucially tougher to win. First  we've added a whole new \nmuch bigger region to each side. So now each team has to\ncapture and return both flags from both of their opponents'\nregions in order to win. The round has a\n16 hour time limit  so if neither team returns\nboth flags in that time  the win goes to whichever\nteam returned more flags  or if that number is the same  whichever team transported\nflags a greater distance. Because Scotty and\nI lost last round  we got to choose our side  and this time we're\ntaking the south  meaning we'll be trying to\nsteal this flag in Funabashi and this one in Sendai. While Ben and Adam need this one\nin Kawasaki and this one in Nishio. In order to cover all that ground  coins are now much more valuable. A mile will only cost you\n10 coins instead of 50. Also  to make it possible to\nactually get out of the Tokyo area  Shinagawa Station and Ueno Station\nare now both neutral zones. And if all that wasn't enough  we also have a new\npowerup available: Towers. They cost 750 coins  and teams can drop them\nwherever they want  both in their own and in\ntheir opponents' territory. When opposing players\nenter the tower's radius  they'll be subject to its effects. Oh  and one other thing: Because there are two flags  this round's worth two points. So if Scotty and I can win it  we'll pull ahead\nin the overall game. So that's round two. And it starts now. Alright  gentlemen. Round two begins... now.\nGood luck! Alright  let's go.\nOkay  we have a plan. It's basically full-court press. We're both gonna go on offense  but we're gonna go\nfor different flags. I'm gonna go for the far flag.\nBen's gonna go for the close flag. And then I'm\ngonna go on defense  because we think the only\nway we're gonna catch them is on the rebound anyway  so I might as well\ngo for the near flag. What do you think we should do?\nWe have a lot of coins. We have a lot of coins. I think we should sprint\nfor the farthest flag. We're not gonna get caught\nbefore we get to the flag. No  not before. The only question is \ncan we get out? But we can split up. I think that's our move.\nSo you think up to Sendai? Just go  go  go  yeah.\nOkay  let's do it. Okay  just so we're clear here  the teams have adopted\nsimilar strategies  both going straight on offense \nbut with a key distinction: Scotty and I are going\nfor the far flag together  which will save us coins\nand prevent us from being slowed down by challenges  while Ben and Adam have\ndecided to split up  meaning they'll cover more\nground but move more slowly  having to stop for challenges. Adam's going for the far flag \nwhich is quite annoying to get to  and Ben's going for the near flag  then turning around to go\nafter us once he's returned it. Basically  it's a\nbit of a speedrun. So let's see who can run faster. Okay  I gotta get\non a Shinkansen asap. Alright  good luck. Alright  I should only have to take\none train to get to their flag. That should be this one. Oh  it's gonna be a cozy train. Alright. I gotta get on a Shinkansen asap. I don't even know\nwhen the next one is. Tōkaidō Shinkansen tracks. Okay. 6:30  track 18. 6:30  where's it going? Where's it going at 6:30? Where's it going at 6:30?\nWhere's it going at 6:30? Platform 20  there's\none in five minutes. Here  this way. Okay  so that took\nforever to figure out  but I finally found the right one that stops locally \nleaves in 20 minutes  so... It looks like they're\nboth going on attack. So at least I'm gonna get\nto the flag  no problem. We are going almost\n170 miles per hour. This is ridonculous. And I think we're\ngonna get in faster. Interestingly  Adam's\nnot left Tokyo Station  which if he took\nthe train after us  he would've by now. Interesting. So... It doesn't seem\nlike the right move  but often when they're\nnot doing the right move  that even makes me more concerned. 'Cause it's like  oh  they\nthought of something we didn't. And it looks\nlike they are just... blasting right past the near flag. Which in my opinion \nis kind of stupid  'cause Ben is gonna get\nthe near flag very easily. We're gonna bank a flag \nthey won't have any  and then Ben can just go\non defense anyway  and... All he has to do is block\nthem on the way back  which... I don't know. Okay  so I've\nmade it to Kawasaki. Their flag's only about\na half mile from here  so I'm just gonna look at... to the best of my ability and... Let's just get this flag... scored  nice and scored. So it seems like what\nthey're probably doing is Ben is going to the closer flag  Adam's going through\nthe further flag. And I'm guessing that Ben is\ngonna start to switch to defense. Yeah. Once he's done\ngetting that flag. Honestly  not a bad strategy  but it's gonna take Adam\nat least five hours  probably closer to six \nto get that flag. Plus he'll have to do challenges. Yeah. So it's gonna\ntake him a while. Okay  so...\nI'm on the bullet train. I'm realizing though that\nit's gonna take a while to get to the flag... Just because it's sort of\nin a weird location. Even though it's about the\nsame distance from the center. So  I'm gonna be pretty\nsignificantly slowed down. So I just really am\ngonna need Ben to be able to slow them down\nwhen he goes on defense. You know  block off stations \nforce them on regional lines  which I do think he's\ngonna be able to do. I don't know. I don't know. Okay  I see\nthe vending machine. Okay... okay... This is it. Please. Okay. Flag... captured. Now I just gotta get back... across our side with it. That's my train back. So  it seems like Ben\nhas either gotten the Tokyo flag or is very  very close to it. He's at the right station  so I think it's a foregone conclusion. He will have the flag.\nYeah  for sure. And Adam's in Shin-Yokohama. Okay. So this might come down\nto a drag race here. Yeah. So  Ben's audio cut out here  but here he is\nreturning the near flag. Yay for him. Welcome to Sendai. Lookit. Not what I had\nplanned  but it'll work. We're going that way.\nIt is chilly. Just wanna get outta\nthe people  huh? Just to explain\nwhy we're running... Yeah. We want to try to\nhopefully make it back for a train that's in 15 minutes. We have about\n20 minutes of walking. Yeah. So walking\nseems like not the move. One of us is training\nfor a marathon. Yeah. Yeah.\nAnd it's not me. So Ben is still in\nUeno Station  seemingly. Yeah. So I think he might\njust be waiting us out there  ready to respond. I'm surprised he had\nthat much budget. Ready  go. Okay  so now that I've\ncaptured the near flag – let's go – the name of the game\nis stop Sam and Scotty. So my plan is  I have enough\ncoins to buy two towers. So... we're just gonna\nstart pulling them. First tower is... What is it? Pizza Tower. Pizza Tower. Opponents may only move in\nthis area while holding pizza. Okay. This one  I think \nis pretty good. You can drop it\nright on top of them  and if they don't\nalready have pizza  it's gonna force them to\nstop whatever they're doing and go get pizza before they... can do anything else in the game. So this one I think\nis pretty solid. Okay  what is it? Trap Tower. Trap Tower. If opponents are texted\n\"trap!\" in this area  they are frozen for 30 minutes. Opponents do not need to be\ninformed of this tower's placement  but if someone says they\nplaced a trap tower  it must be the truth. So they won't know\nthat this one is down  but if they go into its\npretty small radius... they get— we can freeze\nthem for 30 minutes. So this one I think\nis also pretty good. It's a little— I think it might\nbe a little tricky to use  but... I think it's solid. If I can set myself\nup in the right spot and drop these towers on them \nI should be able to tag them. So  let's go. How far are we  Scotty?\nClose. Close  okay  that's good. Oh  that looks like\nthat might be it. I recognize that.\nYes. No IC cards. But it takes notes. People are stopping to help us. Just really— what is this? Third one.\nThird one. What's that?\nThis is a brutal breeze. Let's go. So... this is their flag. What is this  by the way?\nDo you know? I think it's tea. It's got like a stick in it. Oh  it's got a fish in it! See that?\nOh  it does. Is it like fish tea?\nIt was expensive. Yeah. Might be alcohol? Yeah  look. See that little fish? Are you gonna drink it?\nNo. Not yet.\nNot yet. But I might. Celebratory  right?\nYeah. Tokyo Station. Nope  in Tokyo. Not in Canada! Right back the way we came. It's gonna be tight.\nYeep. Scotty  quickly  what are\nyour impressions of Sendai? It's cool. Feels like there's less oxygen. I think we've done it  Scotty. Hopefully! Platform 14. Still waiting there. Let's go. Oh my god. Okay  stop for a second. Nice (bleep) job. I cannot believe\nwe did that. That was 14 minutes. Okay.\nThat was awesome. That worked very well. And I am wiped. You want a sip of fish tea? This is a\npicture of a flying fish. That's awesome. It might be soy sauce. It's an aggressive\namount of soy sauce. Soy sauce. Want some? Very fishy. Yeah  that's soy sauce. Well  we now basically need\nto decide our path into Tokyo. Yeah. Alright  well  it seems like\nthey've gotten on a train to... I don't know where. I don't know what train they're on.\nWe can't tell what train they're on. But I'm pretty sure they\nhave to go through Ōmiya in order to get back  at least  if they want to get back in\nany remotely quick place. So I'm going straight to Ōmiya now  and hopefully we can figure\nout what they're doing. Best I can tell... Ben is on this train. But I don't really understand\nwhy he would be on that train. Doesn't seem to make sense. Alright  I've made it to Ōmiya. And the deal is \nfrom what we can tell  basically if they\nwant to get to Tokyo  they've almost certainly\ngotta go through here. Okay  now I\nhave it figured out. Okay  so Ben's probably\ngoing to there  Ōmiya. Oyama.\nNo  Ōmiya. Oh. We are stopping at Ōmiya. Oyama?\nNo  Ōmiya. What? Let me see. I think we can be\npretty confident that— Oh  I see. That's where he is\ntrying to choke us off. Oh  he— No chance. They might think\nthey can give me the slip  but if I pop down the Pizza Tower and force them off their train... It's a pretty big station  but\nI think I'd be able to get them. So... Yeah  I'm just gonna post up here. And sit menacingly and hopefully scare them or something. I don't know. Are they scared?\nI hope they're scared. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus What the (bleep) are Towers? (laughs) Well  they can find out\nnext episode  which is up right now\non Nebula. Or they can find out in the\nThe Layover podcast. Which  what is that  Ben? So every week \nwe hop on a call after the episode goes up. And we talk to Scotty  and we go over everything\nthat happened that week and all of the implications of all\nof the strategy and the what-ifs. And this week  we're\nreally gonna be diving into everything to do with round two because now the map\nis so much bigger. There are all of\nthese new mechanics. And we're gonna dig into\nall of that in detail and really get into\nthe nitty-gritty. So if you're interested in\nsome of the behind the scenes and how the game is working... the Layover podcast is... That's what you want\nto be listening to. Tens of thousands of\npeople listening each week. It's amazing. And you can listen to The Layover\nexclusively on Nebula. Nebula  if you don't know  is the\ncreator-owned and creator-founded and creator-run streaming site that was built to be the best\nhome for creators' content. So not only do you get\none-week-early episodes of Jet Lag  not only do you get\nthe Layover podcast... Which by the way \nthere's about 100 000 people who watch Jet Lag\none week early on Nebula. And there's Discord discussions\nand Reddit discussions. And if you wanna be able to be\npart of that whole community  subscribing to Nebula is a\nreally great way to do it. But it's not just Jet Lag. There's so much original\ncontent on Nebula. There are full-length\ndocumentary films. There are full-length actual films. There are stage plays. There are multiple original series. All by a lot of creators who\nyou probably already watch  who were just given\nmore money and more time to make their passion projects. And all of that is\nstored on Nebula. Yeah  it turns out that\nif you just take creators who are really good at operating\non a budget on YouTube  and making content that\npeople actually want to watch  and have earned an\naudience through that  and just give them more budget... It's intuitive \nthey just make better stuff. And that was a lot of\nthe idea behind Nebula  and also to create a more\nsustainable ecosystem for these creators. There's a lot that goes into that \nwith the business model. But one of the most crucial\naspects is the fact that when you sign up using\nour link  nebula.tv/jetlag  we actually get a portion\nof your subscription fee for life  for as long\nas you stay subscribed  which gives us predictable \nrecurring  stable monthly revenue that's not impacted by the\nebbs and flows of ad rates.

In order to win the round  a team has to capture both\nof their opponent's flags and get them over the line. Ben and Adam have already\ncaptured the near flag  meaning that if Adam makes\nit back with the far flag  the round is theirs  but\nthat's gonna take him hours. Scotty and I made a beeline\nto capture the far flag  and we're already on our way back. The only problem is \nBen is waiting for us at a devastating\nchoke point before Tokyo. Okay  now I have it figured out. Okay  so Ben's probably\ngoing to there. Ōmiya. Oyama.\nNo  Ōmiya. Oh. We are stopping at Ōmiya. Oyama.\nNo  Ōmiya. What? Lemme see. So I think we can\nbe pretty confident that Oh  I see. That's where he is\ntrying to choke us off. Oh  he— No chance. They might think they\ncan give me the slip  but... If I pop down the Pizza Tower\nand force them off their train... It's a pretty big station  but\nI think I'd be able to get them. So... Yeah  I'm just gonna post up here. And sit menacingly\nand hopefully... scare them or something.\nI don't know. Are they scared?\nI hope they're scared. Okay  so how\nmany coins do you have? Before we record. 1490.\nOkay  and I have 2150. We're just in great shape. Just makes me feel\nlike we made the exact right decision yesterday. Yes.\nOkay  so here's the plan. So I am\ngonna carry the flag. And I'm gonna head\non a northern route that does not go on the Shinkansen. It's slow  but Ben is\nnot at all positioned to cut me off very well right now. Yeah.\nIf he does get close to me  my plan is to just get off the\ntrain and take him on a hike. I'm gonna be\nthe bait basically. So Ben basically has to\nmake a judgment call. Does he go for me or\ndoes he go for Scotty? We hope that he goes for me  but it's not a big deal if not \nbecause if he does  I'm in the clear to just\ngrab the other flag  quickly  take it over the line  and\nthen I'm free basically to either go on defense\nor to  I don't know  maybe go meet you or something.\nRight  yep. So I'm feeling pretty\ngood about our options. I'm feeling really good. I'm gonna put this inside the bag \n'cause otherwise I'm gonna lose it. I have to transfer\nacross town here  which is a 24 minute walk. And the train leaves 17 minutes\nafter you're supposed to be in. It leaves at 52. I think I'm gonna book it. Oh  you gotta run. Oh yeah  I'm... Alright  well  we split up. We haven't split up\nmuch this game. It's kind of weird doing\nthis without Scotty  but... Yeah  so I'm pretty much\njust kind of waiting to see if Ben makes a move at this point. In a way  just me sitting here  if that keeps Ben where he is now  that buys time for\nScotty  which is great. So  I'm pretty much on\nBen monitoring duty right now. Okay  so right now \nI'm waiting on the platform that their Shinkansen would arrive. But it seems like they both\ngot off a couple stops earlier and Scotty is running off \nGod knows where. And Sam... is just hanging out. I don't know why. I don't know what the deal is. But I'm just gonna keep\nan eye on them  stay here. I still think this is\nthe most strategic spot. I don't wanna make any hasty moves  just 'cause they're\ndoing something weird. That's what they want me to do.\nI'm not gonna do it. I'm just gonna hang out\nhere at lovely Ōmiya. And... wait for their inevitable demise. Alright  Ben's\nstill down at Ōmiya. Hasn't really made a move yet. So I'm still gonna wait this out \nsee if he makes a move  and kind of just wait to respond\nto his move  pretty much. I don't really wanna do\nanything until he does. I kind of want to keep\nthis stalemate  'cause it buys time for Scotty. So if you haven't noticed  the game is in kind of an\nodd position right now. Scotty has a flag and is\nbeginning his return unopposed. Adam is heading towards\na flag  also unopposed. And Ben and I \nthe two people who you'd expect to be\nchasing after the flag carriers  are locked in a stalemate. But what's strange is \nas you might have noticed  we both believe that stalemate\nis good for our team. My plan is pretty simple: stall Ben until Scotty is\nclose enough to the line that Ben can't stop him. At which point \nI'll either go for the near flag or go on defense to stop Adam  with Scotty coming in to support. Ben's plan is also\nrelatively simple: stay at Ōmiya and\nstall me long enough that Adam can get to\ntheir flag and get back  which would win them the round  as they've already\nreturned their near flag. It's all gonna come\ndown to the timing. And frankly  it's hard\nto tell who's right. Scotty has to take a lot of\nslow regional lines back  but Adam's flag is\ninconveniently located and requires several transfers. Plus he doesn't have the coins to\nget back without doing challenges. Basically it's a speedrun with\na staring contest at the center. So let's see who can run faster. Nothing like a midday jog. It's pretty  if nothing else. It's gorgeous here. Some beautiful tulips up here. Dig deep. Dig deep. Okay  where do I go now? Where is the train station? Down here? I don't know. Don't understand that.\nCome on. Crap. I'm at Toyohashi. Here at Toyohashi Station  and... I have to get on the Meitetsu\nLimited Express to Shin Anjō  and then I'm gonna transfer\nfrom there to a different train to get me to Nishio \nwhere the flag is. Alright. Meitetsu Line... there. Okay. Excuse me. Sumimasen. Okay. I'm at Shin Anjō Station. and I just have to transfer—\n(conductor blows whistle) Oh  that scared me. I don't know if you heard me\nbreaking out my sumimasen. That means\n\"excuse me\" or \"I'm sorry.\" And it is one of the three\nJapanese phrases that I learned. I considered for a while\nlearning how to say \"I don't speak Japanese.\" But I kind of figured that they\nwould be able to figure that out  sort of just based on context. So  I just stuck to the three: Kon'nichiwa... Arigatō gozaimasu  which is like \"thank you.\" People say that all the time here. And then sumimasen \nwhich is really my go-to. I'm just sort of always\ntelling people  \"Sumimasen.\" I'm just kind of sorry\nfor being around. I'm sorry for  you know... not knowing what I'm doing \net cetera  sumimasen. Alright. Three stops \nfive minute walk  and I'll have the flag. It's taken a while \nbut we're gonna get it. (breathes heavily) I dunno. Aha  I found it. Okay. For Tochigi. That's a welcome\nsight for sore eyes. Looks like\nScotty made his train. That's awesome. My man has been\ngetting his steps in. And Ben  still at Ōmiya. Okay  so it looks like\nScotty has started taking this very slow local line\nthat goes nowhere. So presumably he's just trying\nto take a very long-winded way back to their territory. And I'm not gonna fall for that. I'm not gonna go chase after him\nand let them both get back. But they're burning\ndaylight  you know? And that's what we want right now. I think we can buy ourselves\nenough time to win this round. Adam's just gotta move quickly. It's very beautiful here. It's very charming. Okay! I've made it\nto Nishio Station. Let's go get the damn flag. Okay. The flag... is just up here. Okay. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8. Ooh  fun! It's a little apple drink  okay. And folks... that is the flag! Okay  so  I only\nhave 250 coins left  and I need about 2 000\nto get back. Coming on track two. So  it's about a mile walk from here to the next\nstation that I have to go to. So I'm hoping that I'm gonna\npull cards that I can do while I'm on that walk. Alright  let's pull a card. Quick shuffle... and... Eat an egg. It may be in any form  but must recognizably\nbe an actual egg. You must eat roughly\none egg's worth of egg. The egg cannot be completely raw. Okay  this\nshould be very doable. Very  very doable. Okay. Unfortunately  not a lot of coins. I'm gonna need a lot more \nand it's a 600  so the intervals aren't\nvery good for me. But that's okay. I'm going to find an egg. Okay. I'm just gonna start walking\ntowards that station  and I'm imagining that\nI'll pass somewhere where I can buy\nan egg on the way. Okay  so I'm gonna\ncall Sam and figure out a plan here. Hey.\nHang on one sec. Let me make sure\nI'm getting audio  yeah. So  I just got off the\ntrain in Tochigi... and I've got about 45\nminutes until my next train  which puts me across the\nline around 12:45 pm? Okay. Because my only worry is Adam\nseemingly just got to the flag. So that kind of puts us at a\nthree-hour countdown clock. Yes. I don't think I have good options\nthat are not through Ōmiya. Okay.\nWhere Ben is. Basically at a certain point  I think I might need to make a\nShinkansen gamble through there. Is there any reason\nnot to do that now? Well  the question is \nI guess... Can Ben get to you in the time that he\nwould have after that? I don't know. Let me spend some time\nresearching that and call you back. All I can do is\nsit here and look scary. Arrgh. Arrgh. That should do the trick. Ah  crap. I think we might have\na serious problem here. He can get to... ...Ino  where I'm\nheaded in 45 minutes. Because there's a Shinkansen\nthat goes to Takasaki. That's a problem. So just to clarify here \nScotty's just figured out that Ben has a much faster path to\ncutting him off than we realized. That's because\nŌmiya Station  where Ben is  is both a choke point\nand a hub. It's connected to\ntwo Shinkansen lines  so if Ben goes up this line  he could get to where Scotty\nis headed in about 45 minutes. That means to keep Scotty safe  I'll have to stall Ben even\nlonger before making a move  which means our tightly\ntimed plan is starting to look a little less airtight. As you may be able to tell  I was not thrilled by this news. Mm-kay. That's not great.\nIt's not great. So... Maybe you need to\nramp up the risk? I think so. I think you need to\nput pressure on him. Yeah  this is not looking as\ngreat as it did a little while ago. No  it's not.\nWhat do you think? So basically then  I'm gonna wait for\nthe next Shinkansen  which is 40 minutes from now. Okay. Yep.\nAnd then take that in. And see if I can get through.\nYou think that's the best bet? I think so. I think we'll keep him busy \nif nothing else. Yeah. Yeah  I don't love it \nbut I think yeah  we need to ramp up the risk. Yeah  I'm worried\nthat Adam's just gonna beat us in now  so... I think we do have to move.\nYeah  that's a real issue. Let's find an egg. This place sells sewing machines. They won't have eggs. Oh  supermarket  okay. Alright. Alright  presumably\nI need to find... a refrigerated area  okay. This is not a supermarket. This is the supermarket. Okay! Something with a\ncooked egg in it. What is this? That does not look like egg. Is that egg? It looks like egg. Let's try taking a— Let's try translating this guy. Here we go. \"Torn egg\"! Yeah. Oh  great  okay. That's an egg. That's egg. Let's go  let's go  let's go. We've done it.\nFolks  we've done it. Okay. Alright  everybody. Welcome to The Snack Zone! It's a show within a show\nwhere we review Japan's best and worst foods. Today we'll be trying\n\"torn egg\". Oh  it's bizarrely sweet. Alright. Challenge complete. (in Japanese)\n...is my request  please! Alright. Time to draw another challenge. Alright. And... Cursed! You must turn the language\nsettings on your research phone to Japanese\nfor the next two hours. You must also only use\nthe Japanese keyboard. Use of apps is allowed. Ah-ah-aah-aaah! (sniffle  whimper) Okay. Okay. It's fine. I already know what\ntrains I'm going to take. And... I already know... how I'm going to get back. (shivering) Alright  let's do this. Oh god. With this curse  Adam now\nhas all the coins he needs  but to actually return the flag  he'll have to successfully complete\nthe following solely from memory: Walk to and find Anjō Station \nwhich is almost a mile away  where he'll have\nto manage to get on the local Tōkaidō Line \ngoing towards Nagoya – actually going the\nopposite way from Tokyo – then get off at\nMikawa-Anjō Station  where he'll then have to\nget on a Kodama Shinkansen going towards Tokyo. Scotty  on the other hand  is having a bit of trouble\neven with his phone in English. After microwaving some noodles at\na 7-Eleven before his next train  he took out his phone to\nfind the right platform  and while he thought\nhe was filming  but was actually taking a\npicture of his left arm  began to realize he's gone to the\ncomplete wrong part of the station  prompting the most cursing\nwe've heard from him all game. (bleep) What? (bleep) Ah (bleep) Okay. Anjō Station here. Good start. Okay  so logically... I would be going towards Nagoya. As that says. 11:06... track two. Track two. Alright  train's here. Sumimasen. Takasaki?\nTakasaki... Okay. (titters) Arigatō gozaimasu. (warning chime) Whoop. (warning chime) (warning chime) (speaking Japanese) Pass.\nOkay. (speaking Japanese)\nArigatō gozaimasu. I'm in trouble. Alright \nShinkansen station... This way. For Shizuoka and Tokyo. Alright. Let's see if they can stop me! So it looks like\nAdam is headed back on the Shinkansen now\nwith the flag. Which is not great. This is gonna be a\nrace down to the wire. We have to go\nget our other flag. Hopefully  Sam's on the move. Okay  well about 10 minutes\nto my Shinkansen. To be honest  I don't love\nthe position we're in. Ben and Adam are\nplaying this smart. They are being diligent\nwith their strategy. I thought they would\nget tantalized by Scotty running off to the west\nand looking like he has the flag. But... no. They were smart.\nThey're smart. And Ben is just staying put\nin a really good spot  'cause he has really good\nmobility from that station. And it's a choke point  so... I don't love this  but I\nthink that's why we have to start applying pressure. The main thing I need\nto figure out is  am I gonna stay on or\nam I gonna get off? Which is just like\nclassic game theory. I don't really know.\nI think I'm just gonna kind of feel it out\nin the moment  you know? So  now I'm heading in the\ndirection to the station where Ben is waiting for me  but there's one way I might\nbe able to slip past him. You see  Ben doesn't know\nwhether I'm planning on getting off my train\nat the station or staying on it. That means that if\nI get off the train  but he thinks I'm staying on it\nand boards the train to tag me  I'll send him away\nand free me up to take a different\ntrain outta the station. If I stay on the train  but\nhe thinks I'm getting off it  then he'll wait for me\non the platform while I just blow right past him. All of this  of course \nassumes that Ben doesn't have some sort of crazy way\nof forcing me off the train. Well  it looks like Sam\nis finally heading for me. So  it's time to put down\nthe ol' Pizza Tower. I'll let them know. Ben dropped the Pizza Tower. Which means I need to get off. Which means I have virtually\nno chance getting past Ōmiya. Which is lame. Oh  hold on.\nAdam's calling me. Yeah  okay  so I think\nit's clear that Sam probably doesn't even care that much\nif he gets tagged or not  because he's gonna go after me. So just like... As much as you can \nstall him. Like you— you know— You could wait\non the platform and not catch him\ntechnically yet. Yeah. So I'm gonna... I'm not gonna tag him  but the freeze period\nis gonna matter. So I'm gonna want to\ntag him eventually  but I'm gonna hold off\nas long as I can. Okay  bye. Alright  here we go. Got basically no shot with\nthe Pizza Tower thing. But might as well give\nit a shot  you know? Waste a little bit more\nof his time or something. Okay  so Sam knows\nthat the Pizza Tower's here  so he is gonna be forced off\nto get onto this station. But what he\ndoesn't know is that I'm also placing down\nthe Trap Tower. So once he's forced off\nthe train right here... I'm gonna go ahead and trap him. And that's gonna freeze\nhim for 30 minutes. And then after that \nI can tag him  send him back to Tokyo Station \nfreeze him for another 30 minutes. And so that hopefully in total should buy Adam enough\ntime to get back before he can go on defense.\nThat's the plan. So... Sam should now be getting off. Okay  Sam is now in the\nradius of the Trap Tower. So I'm gonna go ahead and\ninform him that he is trapped. And then we'll go find him. I've been frozen. Ben froze me. This sucks. So I would guess that he's\ngonna come tag me in a second? There he is. He's the one who's\nsupposed to be filming me. Hello  Sam.\nHello  Ben. Stay put. I have no other option. Okay. I have Sam not on camera. I'm not tagging him.\nSam  say hi. Hi  Ben. That's Sam on camera. So  he's here. We're not tagging him. And that's not\na great camera angle. We're just waiting. I don't want you\nto get in the shot  because then you'll be tagged.\nOkay. So... We're waiting. Alright. We're waiting for the\nfreeze period to be up. Sam  do you want\nanything from Starbucks? It's right over there. It's right over there. Maybe. Okay  I'll get you\nsome Starbys. So what is it\nwith your guys' team and sitting at—\nsitting still for four hours? I would like to think that you\nwere sitting still for four hours. I was waiting for you to come. Why would I have done that? That would've been stupid. To capture me. I didn't wanna do that.\nI didn't wanna capture you. Why not?\nI still don't wanna capture you. I could capture you right now.\nWe're not doing it. Okay. You know  it's called\nCapture the Flag. And we're about to\ncapture the second flag. Yeah? Okay. How many flags has\nyour team captured  Sam? Is this a Snack Zone? (hums dramatically) It actually tastes really bad. I don't know why\nI keep getting this. I don't know.\nI don't like Starbucks. Alright  Ben  it's almost time. So you gonna tag me or... we're gonna go get pizza? Okay. Well  Sam gets out of\nhis freeze in a minute. But  I still haven't tagged him. And... Sam  if you haven't realized this  what I need to be doing right now is wasting as much of\nyour time as possible. What? So... You do have to go get pizza \nbut I'm gonna be pointing... This is like  I have a\nloaded gun pointed at you. If you try any funny business... you know  I can send\nyou right back to Tokyo. Alright. Okay  it's 12:21. You're free. Okay  bye.\nNo. Okay. I'm... Don't you go anywhere. Don't you find any pizza. There better not be\nany pizza in here. I'm not gonna point\nthe camera at you. No pizza. This does not seem like a\nvery pizza-forward country. Alright  Ben  we're going out. Alright  my JR Pass\nisn't working. So Sam  I'm tagging you. Ugh  okay. Alright  I'm free. Let's go to Tokyo Station. Bye  Ben!\nBye  Sam. Unless  do you wanna\ncome with me? I mean  I guess I\nactually have no idea what I should do at this point. And I don't think I'm\ngetting to Scotty. Scotty's kind of in the\nmiddle of nowhere right now. I guess you didn't— So I guess you know\nwhere our flag is. I figured you\ndidn't have the flag. But it would've been kind of a\ncool 4D chess move if you did. I'll come to Tokyo. I don't think that being here\nis doing anything for me. So I'm probably gonna\ngo back to Tokyo too. I bet Adam's being\npretty smug right now. Well  no he's not. He never feels smug\nright until the very  very\nlast minute  but... I think we should have a new\nmotion graphic element in Jet Lag. Which is a live Adam\nheart rate monitor. Yeah. He's... Sometimes he calls me and\nthere's like  not even... I can't even tell what he's saying. (laughs) Hello  Adam. I have tagged Sam and... He's going back to Tokyo. I'm also going back to Tokyo. I'm kind of useless at this point. Yeah  I don't know. Ben. Yeah? Could Scotty\nget back fast enough? Get tickets for you? Yeah  for me. I don't believe so. Just check  okay? 'Cause I think that\nif he can't  it's not by much. 'Cause he's about to\nget to a Shinkansen line that'll take him to Tokyo quickly. Okay. Okay  it might be\ncloser than you think. Bye  Adam.\nBye  buddy. Well  here it is. Flag officially across the line. One down  one to go. I think the bigger question is... can we stop Adam from bringing\nhis flag over the line? Sam got tagged  he's headed\nback to Tokyo Station. So I think it's up to me\nto try and block Adam here. So I've gotta take a Shinkansen\ndown to Tokyo Station  and then transfer and head out on the line that\nAdam's on  two stops. So  I'm hoping I can\ndo that in time. Okay  here we go. Platform 14. The Shinkansen is this way. Shinkansen... this way. I don't know what stop I'm at. Oh  I'm pulling into Ōmiya. Oh crap. And there's a\nPizza Tower active here. Crap. I forgot about that. I have to go get pizza. Damn it. I mean  I don't really think\nI had a choice  but... Alright  Ben has confirmed. Scotty cannot get to me. (mouth click) I think that means\nround two is over. In... about an hour once I get back. Mount Fuji. More like Mount Wahoo-ee. 'Cause we're gonna win the round. Alright  hi \nI'm in this station. I don't even know\nwhat station I'm in. I just got on the first\ntrain I could outta Tokyo. You know what? While I'm here  might as well do a\nchallenge or two  while we wait for Adam. Let's see... Let's see if we can get an\neasy one and just knock it out. I think that's pretty shuffled. Top one. Break copyright law. Break copyright law. Find at least four places where we'll have to mute the audio\nfor copyright reasons. Each place must be\nat least 100 feet apart from any other selected place. You may not initiate the playing\nof any sound on any device. Okay. That might be a little tough\nwith the remaining time  but... I can certainly give it a go. I guess I'll leave the station and look for stores\nthat might be playing music. Let's see if this Starbucks has\nany copywritten music playing. There was for sure\nmusic playing in there  which we can't play for you\nfor the obvious reasons  but that's one down  three to go. I have to make sure that\nSam doesn't come after me once he's... out of his freeze period. Because if he gets all\n1 530 of his coins back  that's gonna be really annoying. So  well  we'll keep\nan eye out for him too. I hear music over there.\nI'm gonna go over there. Alright  Adam's left\nShin-Yokohama. So that's pretty much it. So the one thing I'm gonna do now is head down to Shimbashi\nStation  where Ben is  just to see if I can\ncatch him  just in case  before Adam gets here. And that way \nI can steal his coins. Would be nice  at least. I hear something over there. This thing  this thing\nis playing music. It's a new digital single by Tee. I bet any amount of\nmoney that this... Pachinko place has got some\ncopyrighted music going. Let's go in there. That'll be fun. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Okay  that was the\nmost stressful place I've ever been in my entire life. But I got like at least 150\nmore copyrighted songs  so... I think that's challenge complete. Alright  now I just kinda\ngotta not get caught by Sam until Adam wins us the round. So I'm just gonna wander... in an unpredictable pattern... until the end of the round. See you then. Ben Doyle \nyou just got caught! I just looked at the tracker! So you decided\nto walk towards me? No  it showed you\nstill in Tokyo Station two minutes ago.\n(laughs) Oh  that makes me\nfeel so much better. Even if this round\ndid not go our way. You did a challenge? Alright  Sam.\nEnjoy 2 530 coins. Oh  that's pretty good. Do you wanna head\nback to Tokyo Station? That makes me\nfeel so much better. It's gonna give us a nice— That was a nice\nlittle present  Ben. 2 530  wow.\nThat is generous  man. Thank you. You're gonna need it. Ben got tagged. (chuckles weakly) Over the line. (slapping thigh) Round two in the bag  baby.\nLet's go! Alright  Sam \nI've just been informed that Adam has arrived here at Tokyo Station.\nWhat? I know  crazy  right? That means round two is over. Oh no. We've got three points. Well  luckily  next round\nis worth three points. Yep  so you can tie it up.\nSo we can still tie it up. And go to the sudden death. I don't love that though.\nDeath round. That's not great. We'll see what\nhappens next round. 'Cause it's gonna get complicated. Oh yeah. Well  damn. I was feeling so confident at\nthe beginning of this round. I'm not quite sure\nwhere we went wrong. I think... Maybe we need to consider\nplaying defense next round. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Round three: the entire\ncountry of Japan is in play. There are three flags on the map. Three points on the line. Will Scotty and I\nmanaged to tie it up and force us into a\nsudden death elimination round? Or will Ben and Adam finish\nthe game right here  right now? Well  it all starts  episode four. Which is coming next\nweek on YouTube. Or you can watch it right now \nthis instant  on Nebula. That's because every single\nepisode of Jet Lag comes out one week\nearly on Nebula  which means the next\nepisode is always up there. We also do a Nebula-exclusive\npodcast called The Layover. It's where we dive\ndeeper into the episodes and really take you behind\nthe scenes of what happens. And this week is\na really fun one because I think all of the teams learned\na lot from round two especially and had to make a lot of\nadjustments to their strategy. Scotty and I definitely did. (guffaws) Yeah.\nYeah. So in this episode  we really break down\nall of round two and how all of the lessons\nthat we learned from that and sort of discuss and\ndebate what the takeaways are and how we use that to\nprep for round three that we're going into.\nMhm. And subscribing to Nebula\ndoesn't just get you Jet Lag perks. It also gets you access\nto this massive catalog of amazing original content. I mean  it's like  feature-length\ndocumentaries  original series  stage plays  extra videos from all\nyour favorite creators  things a week early. I... Are you making fun of me? No!\nOh. I'm emphasizing your point.\nI love Nebula. Nebula's  again  it's probably one\nof my most used streaming services. I... Now you're making fun of me. No  we're not.\nEveryone's making fun of me! No  Ben  you're being paranoid. Subscribe to Nebula.\nIt's a great— There's so much good stuff from\nall your favorite creators. I'm gonna kill Adam. Okay  Adam is\nmaking fun of you. That's kind of rude  yeah. Anyway. It's also good for\nthe creators because we actually founded it. Myself and a bunch\nof my creator friends a couple years ago came\ntogether and we were like  \"What would a streaming site look\nlike if the creators ran it?\" So we really wanted to\nmake a better experience for the creators and\nfor the audience. So for the audience \nwe of course do everything that we just talked about. You know  early stuff \nexclusive stuff. There's also  by the way \nno ads  no sponsorships  no algorithm getting in the way. So it's really a clean \ncontent-first platform. But then it's also  you know \na better thing for the creators. You know  for example  one of the\nbig thing that feeds into that is when you sign up using\nour link  nebula.tv/jetlag  we actually get a portion\nof your subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed. So that gives us predictable \nrecurring monthly revenue that is not— doesn't really\nhave the ebb and flow of ad rates.

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nback to episode four of Capture the Flag across Japan. We're about to start the third\nand final round of the game  where the board has been expanded\nto cover the whole country  and each team has\nthree flags to capture. The round is over when\none team has scored all of their opponent's flags \nor at the end of 20 hours  where the team that has\nscored the most flags wins. If at the end of 20 hours  both teams have scored\nthese same number of flags  then the round goes to whichever\nteam has transported unscored flags the most total distance\ntowards the center. This round's three points\nare worth a lot. Right now  the score is 3-0. That means that if Ben and Adam win \nthey'll win the whole thing. But if Scotty and I win \nthe game is tied  and we'll go to our\nsudden death tiebreaker round. It's still anybody's game... and it all comes down to this. Alright  Jet Laggers.\nReady for round three? Let's do it. Alright  we'll start it in\nthree  two  one... Let's go. Alright  let's go  Adam. We don't have\na lot of coins  so— I'm gonna go grind\nchallenges to start. And we're gonna send\nAdam for the near flag. Yeah  'cause I do\nhave enough to get to that. So  I'm gonna look up\nhow to get there... and then just make a beeline. They're not\neven looking at us. Okay  so—\nLet's go now. So  Scotty... The last couple rounds\ndidn't exactly go our way. Yeah  I was pretty demoralized at the end of last round \nI have to say. And the thing is\nthere's not one moment from yesterday at least that's\nlike  this is where we lost it. No! It was just like our\nfundamental strategy was wrong. Yes. I think we want to kind of be\nmore responsive to what they do. I think so. Especially considering\nthis is gonna be a long round. I think so. You know  it's not\ngonna be a speedrun. So I think we want\nto kind of just wait  see what they're doing.\nI mean  they were booking it. So I wonder if they're\nrunning to catch a train. Alright  here we go. Alright  let's see... how to get to the flag. Okay  come on  come on \ncome on  come on. Come on  come on  come on. Okay. Okay  the Chūō Line. The Chūō Line. Where the (bleep) is that? We're just gonna go one stop\ninto enemy territory... and... start pulling challenges. So we want to go to\nplatform six  right up here. Platform one  platform one. That's for Ōme— Oh. Oh. Oh  incredible  okay. The doors on the\nright side will open... Sam and Scotty \nstill at Tokyo Station. Tick-tock  boys! Better get a move on! Hey  Sam.\nHey  so they split up. Adam seems to be on the\ntrain to the second flag. Ben went south.\nHe's headed towards Shinagawa. I don't know exactly\nwhich train he's on yet. What do you think? Should I maybe get ready for\na run of the second flag then? 'Cause they seem to be both\ngoing somewhat offensive. Yeah  sounds good. Okay  so I'll get on\nthe platform ready for a run  and then I'll see you in a bit. Or well  we'll talk in a bit.\nOkay. Okay  bye.\nYeah. Alright  so I have a train in about 20 minutes that I\ncould take to our second flag. So I'm just gonna sit around here and try to learn a little bit more\nabout what Ben and Adam are doing  based on train times and stuff. Okay. Hello. We're gonna shuffle  shuffle \nshuffle  shuffle  shuffle. And then we're gonna pull one. Find a Maneki-neko. Find any Maneki-neko \nand take a photograph of it. Any statue or figurine of a\ncat with a raised paw counts. That I can hopefully do. These maneki-nekos \nthese are a thing I guess that are popular in Japan. They're these cat statues\nthat go like this. And then sometimes their\npaw goes like that. I don't really know where\nI would go to find one  but maybe a... restaurant or something? Alright  so Ben is\ndown at Shimbashi Station. I'm not really— He must be doing\nchallenges  I guess. So maybe Scotty\nshould go after him. Lemme call Scotty. So Ben is down at\nShimbashi Station  I assume doing challenges. That's exactly where\nI caught him yesterday. I wonder if it makes sense\nfor you to go after him. See if you can tag— That's exactly what\nI was trying to figure out. Okay  see if you can tag him.\nAnd if you did tag him  maybe then you would\nhave a really good window to get the Tokyo flag. Or at least go towards it with him in jail at Tokyo Station. That seems like a good opportunity. Okay  I'll do that. Going to Shimbashi Station. Take the JR line here... and it's go  go  go. I'll be there in ten minutes. Just gonna keep my eyes peeled. 'Cause these things\ncould be anywhere. Oh my god. This is— Okay  I found one. Okay  okay. Challenge complete. Collect three\nitems from Mario Kart. Your options are:\nbanana peel  mushroom  big yellow star  shell  bullet \nbomb  boomerang  coin  squid  feather  venus fly trap.\nNo duplicates. Collect three\nMario Kart items. Let's check where Ben is. Oh  great. Ben is way far away\nfrom the station. Feel really good about this. Ben  here I come! Let's make sure that I'm safe. Oh (bleep) Okay  well  actually it looks\nlike Scotty's coming after me. Alright  it's about ten minutes\nuntil that Shinkansen  so I'm gonna get to the platform. Scotty's getting close.\nI like this. Now he's getting\nready to run probably. Scotty will never find— Oh  he is getting closer. So... here's the thing. The station I need to get\noutta here with is right there. But Scotty's coming for me  so I think I just gotta give\nhim the slip some other way. I gotta look for other stations. We're gonna go here. We're gonna tire Scotty out. Because I'm young. And full of... youthful vigor. Oh  I'm so tired already. Alright  I'm gonna\ntake a right at the next alley. But I'm getting progressively\ncloser  which is good. There's a subway up ahead.\nIf I just hop on it and go any direction \nbut especially... Maybe I should just reset\nto my safe territory... and then I can really\nget some distance on him. Oh  good \nthere's a pass through. I've got options. This is the station\nwe have to go to. Scotty's already probably figured\nout that I'm going this way  but that's okay. Oh crap  he's\nheaded for a station. Okay  lemme pick up the pace. (panting) Ben should be close. Okay  I think that this is\ngoing back into my territory. But Scotty could\nbe here any second. I hope he hasn't\nalready gotten on a train. Alright. This is a train. As long as Scotty doesn't\nget here  I'm good. That's a train coming. Crap. Oh my god  oh my god. Sumimasen  sumimasen. That's Ben! Ben. Hi.\n(sighs) Alright  let's get off. (laughs exhaustedly) Alright. Back to Tokyo Station. (whispering)\nLet's go  Scotty. Let's go. Incredible. That's so good. So good. See you in a bit! Tokyo flag  here I come. And not ride with him. Alright  time to transfer to the Tamagawa Line\nfor Koremasa. Tamagawa Line  there we go. Tamagawa Line. No problem. It's weird I have to\nleave the station. Tamagawa Line  Tamagawa Line. Where the hell's the\nTamagawa Line? Oh no. Ben got tagged. Shoot. Okay. And I can't find the\ndamn Tamagawa Line. Tamagawa. Tamagawa. Seibu Tamagawa. What the hell? Where's the... Is it this? This is orange. Is this what I want? Koremasa.\nYeah  yeah  Koremasa. Yeah  yeah  that's me. Yep  8:42  that's me. Alright. Oh  Ben. Alright  it is 9:16  which means that\nI am back in the game. It looks like Scotty's\ngoing for the near flag  but it's gonna be a really\ntough one to defend  because there are a million\nroutes back to Tokyo. Now  most of them go through\nthis station called Kitasenju. Not all of them  but most of them. So if I go there  I've got my— the best chance\nof intercepting him. And hopefully if he takes one\nthat's not going through there  I'll have time to\nswitch and cut him off. So I'm gonna go there\nand stake him out there  and hopefully I can get him\nbefore he gets back. A very nice lady on a\nbicycle just said hello to me. It's not something we've\nseen a lot of yet  but... It's always fun. People are always...\nwelcoming and... and eager to test\nout their English  even if it is only \"Hello.\" So... Sam says that Ben is after me. Which makes sense  I guess. I'm almost at the flag. Oh  I see it. It's on the\nother side of the road. Okay. So  Coca-Cola. Okay  right  hang on.\nI gotta figure out change. Yep  we're good. Okay  Dr Pepper acquired. Headed back to the station. I wanna win that boat. Alright  let's go. Just seven minute run to the flag. Should be easy. Let's go to the flag. Which by the way... seems  as far as I can tell  to serve a chicken intestine stew. So that's cool. It's very charming over here. That's fun. Okay  one thing that drives\nme insane about this country is that you can't jaywalk. Nobody jaywalks. Even though I'm all good \nI live in New York City. Every bone in my body is\nscreaming at me to go. There we go  okay. Here we go. Should be coming up on it. Here we go. Oh yeah. Oh  you can... (sniff) Oh  you can smell... You can smell that that\nis chicken intestine stew. For sure. Fourth one. Oh god  that is for sure... That is chicken\nintestine stew  for sure. So now  here's the plan. I'm down to like 410 coins  so I'm gonna go ahead and\nat least pull a challenge  see if it's something\nthat's easy to do  on my way over the line. Because if I could just\nearn a few more coins  I could have enough money to\nbuy a tower for when I defend  and I do think that\nthat would be useful. Okay. I'm out of the neutral zone now. So I'm gonna pull a challenge. Alright  quick shuffle and... See a great wave. View any wave and remark\nupon how great it is. It may be a real wave\nor a depiction  though the depiction may not\ncome from anything traveling with you or a digital device. If you see the wave\nwhile in Kanagawa  the reward is doubled. Okay. Okay  while I run... I'm just gonna look for\nanything that might have a depiction of a wave. No waves. No waves yet. Okay  here's a vending machine. Maybe it has a wave in it? Or on it? Oh. That's a wave. It's a great wave. Alright  I've sent a\npicture to the group. Sam and Scotty have both agreed that that is a depiction of a wave. Let's pull another challenge. Alright. Cursed!\nYou are now Hello Kitty. You cannot advance in the game until you find or create\na pink bow and put it on. Once you find the bow  you must wear it for\nthe next two hours. You cannot talk to or text\nanyone other than the camera for that period of time. Cursed. (gasp) (bleep) Alright  I gotta go figure\nout a way to make a pink bow. Alright  I can still talk to you. But to no one else. I can't text Ben. (snorts) Alright  so it looks like\nScotty made it back to the station. So the question's gonna be \nis he gonna go towards me  or is he gonna try and go around? We're just gonna wait\nand see what he does. Well  crap. Sam says  \"Don't go that way.\" Which way should I go\nthen  question mark? I think he said go on that\ntrain that's arriving now  crap! See if I can get it. Okay. Talk about last\nminute change  geez. Alright  it looks\nlike he's going around  so I have to go around and... try and cut him off the other way. I think I have time \nbut I gotta hurry. I think this line goes\nall the way to Tokyo Station. Okay  that's good. Probably just stay on this. Okay  so I just got\noff here in Hatchōbori. I am gonna be able to\nget on Scotty's train. It's gonna arrive right on this\nplatform in a couple of minutes. It's gonna be a little hairy \nbut that's good content. So I'm gonna try. Sam says to get\noff in Nishi-Funabashi. Okay. Yeah  there's some\ngood options. I like the subway option. That's pretty good \nthe Tōzai Line. Okay  it looks like\nScotty transferred trains  so I have to hop up one station. Yeah  I think I can block\nhim off right there. I'm concerned that I\ndon't really know where Ben is. His radius is super\nlarge on the tracker. I think I wanna go one more stop. Okay  now that I'm\nconfident what station— or what train he's on  I'm gonna move up towards\nhim on the Tōzai Line  at least one or two more stations  just to give me more time\nto catch him on the train. Cannot tell where he is. Huge radius  no idea. Other than he's closer to me. Crap. Yeah  get off the next stop. That's the best I can do. Here we go. Let's take Ben on a hike. I am determined to\nnot let Ben catch me. Even if I have to\ngo to great lengths. I want to go to... this station. Via walking. I think Scotty's\ngoing for Shiomi Station. I have to get on. See if there's any\nway to cut him off. I think this line  the Ōedo... something line will take me down  and then I can go across and\nhopefully beat him to the punch. Just gotta make\nthis train and I'm good. I see it. Scotty  you mother-(bleep) Okay. Oh  I'm gonna make it. This is good. Really good. I think I made it home free. Scotty made it\nto Shiomi Station and got on a train  which\nmeans I can't catch him. Well played Scotty \nyou son of a gun. Tokyo. Tokyo. Okay. I made it back to\nTokyo Station with the flag. Untagged. With one flag scored  we're\nstarting this round in the lead. And better yet  Ben is stranded  Adam is stuck out here until\nhe can make himself a pink bow  and I'm almost at our second flag. Scotty got back to Tokyo Station. We just got the first flag.\nThis is looking up. Okay. Did a super quick transfer\nfrom this local train to go one or two stops\nto the flag. So grab a flag and then I need to\nfigure out how I'm getting back. Ooh. Ooh  that looks like\na store of some kind. This seems like a promising\nplace to make a pink bow. Irasshaimase. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Hair clip... here. Arigatō gozaimasu. I did a little sign language\n\"Thank you \" okay. Okay. I'm now Hello Kitty. Alright  let's go return this flag. Okay. (sputters) Alright  out in the open\nfor the first time today. This is great. So just got off of\nthis little stop here. And I'm going a few blocks in to look for the cheesecake\nvending machine. And I have about 15 minutes until the next train back to\nthe big station from there. So I gotta be quick because\nthose trains only come every once in a while. I can pretty confidently\nsay at this point that we out here  you know? This is not Tokyo anymore. I'm pretty sure I see it already. That was easy. Just like that  here's our flag. This is our flag. Now let's bring it back to Tokyo. Alright  only a few minutes\nto make my transfer. Keihin–Tōhoku Line. Yeah  nice.\nJust a few minutes on this... Up to Ōmiya \nget on the Shinkansen. Definitely gonna be\nable to cut Sam off. It is incredibly quiet here  and I am incredibly conspicuous. I don't get the\nsense that they have a lot of American vloggers\ncome through here. But it's really cool just to be\nin a spot like this  that is... clearly super not touristy. I mean  who gets to come\nto places like this? Especially for work? Alright  I've got\nten minutes until my train. That's actually kind of plenty. So heading back to the station now. Heading back to the\nbig Shinkansen station. Then I gotta figure out\nhow I gotta get back. I've made it\nto Ōmiya Station. I got 13 minutes to\nget on my Shinkansen. Okay. Okay. Let me just make sure. Platform 18  yep. Just in case I haven't\nexplained what I'm doing  let me basically\nwalk you through it. So  Sam is up here. That's a problem because this line goes over the midpoint up here at Takasaki. So I can't let him get there. So I'm riding the Shinkansen up. Hopefully I can get all\nthe way up to Nagaoka before he gets to where I am. Hopefully that'll\nblock him and make it so that he has to take\nregional lines back  which at the very least\nwill slow him down a lot. And potentially  I can\nkind of shift gears and go around and stop him on a\nneutral line too  if I need to. So... That is the plan.\nThat is the plan. I think it should work. Time to go defend the flag. Alright  Adam is\nofficially headed my way. So  I need to figure\nout a safe route back. These choke points\nreally are killer. I was not expecting them to be\nquite this hard to get around. But yeah  it's like... If there was just a little bit more\ntime to get past that choke point  I would have an option  but... Problem is these Shinkansen\nlines are so fast that the regional\nlines around them  they're almost not worth anything  because you can just\ntake the Shinkansen up and down and\nup and down to cut off at the choke points\non the regional lines. This is tough.\nI don't know. I don't really know how\nwe're gonna get around this  beyond just kind of\nbrute force trying. Okay  I think I've\ngot it figured out. And it's so complicated\nthat I'm not even sure I can explain it right. And I'm not even sure\nif I have this right. It's very complicated. I think I have it figured out. This is the one possible route out of bajillion different ones. But if I've done it right... this will guarantee\nme safe passage. But I'm honestly not sure. Ohh  ohh. He would get there... 11:58  after me. Wait a minute \nso what does that mean? Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus So what you'll\nsee next episode is whether or not I can\nslip past this guy and make it back to Tokyo. And it definitely gets exciting \nin my opinion. I would argue that it is the\nmost exciting thing that happens. It's good content.\nThe way in which that all plays out. It was  yeah  it was\nhonestly one of my favorite days of playing Jet Lag. Yeah.\nLike ever  actually. It was a really cool day. So  I'm excited for\neveryone to see it. You'll be able to see it\nnext week up here on YouTube. Or if you're a Nebula\nsubscriber  it's up now. Or if you're not an\nNebula subscriber... you probably should be one. Why should they be\na Nebula subscriber? It's Ben's turn\nto say that this time. Oh  why should they\nbe a Nebula subscriber? Well  in addition to getting\nto watch the show a week early  you also get access to our aftershow podcast\ncalled The Layover  where every week \nwe get together with Scotty  and we break down\nthat week's episode. We go over  you know \nall of the strategy and the what ifs and all of\nthe implications going forward. I think that this week's episode\nis gonna be really interesting  because we were super scared\ngoing into round three. It was daunting.\nNone of us knew what we were doing. I mean  all of\nthe strategy this game  we really didn't know\nwhat we were doing. So talking about how \nyou know  we made our plans\ngoing into round three  and how they started to play out.\nYeah. We're getting to all of that  all of the nitty gritty in this week's\nepisode of The Layover. Tens of thousands of\npeople listen every week  so it's clearly not terrible. It might be terrible \nand people listen to it anyway. Yeah. Terrible  but good.\nWe don't know. Yeah  yeah  it could be.\nIn a fun way. Anyway  Nebula\nalso has so much other incredible original content. In addition to people posting\ntheir videos one week early  we have full-length documentaries. We have full-length\nactual  literal movies. There are multiple original\nseries from people like Real Engineering and Real Science\nand RealLifeLore. All of the Reals are in there in addition to other people. We got the Real market on lock. The Real market is\nlocked down on Nebula. It was built to be the\nbest home for our content  and I genuinely do\nbelieve that it is. Yeah  and a lot of\nwhy that is  in my opinion  is because it's\ncreator-founded and creator-run  and turns out that we\nmight know how to make a better viewing experience\nfor our audiences a little bit better than\nprivate equity firms maybe? Maybe  I don't know. So  it was actually\nfounded by myself and a bunch of my creator friends \nfour years ago. And  a lot of our\napproach going into it is we wanted to make it a better\nexperience for the audience  through all the kind of\nthings we were just mentioned. By the way  I don't know\nif we even said  everything's ad and\nsponsorship free. Oh yeah  did you say that? Yeah  no ads  no sponsorships. Not even an algorithm getting in\nthe way of your viewing experience. It's really content-first  but it's also all a better\nexperience for the creators too. More sustainable and\nreally just a business ecosystem that better supports them. One of the biggest aspects of that is that when you sign up using\nour code  nebula.tv/jetlag  we actually get a portion\nof your subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed. Which gives us recurring \nstable monthly revenue that we can really rely on\nto reinvest in the show and make it bigger and\nbetter and cooler and greater and more frequently and\neverything  which is awesome. What's also awesome\nis that if you sign up using our code \nnebula.tv/jetlag  you'll actually get $20 off\nan annual subscription  which brings it down to\n$30 a year or something. So that's two and a\nhalf dollars a month. It's really not that expensive. It's like half of a latte per month. And it really helps\nsupport us  again. So  yeah  make sure to sign up.

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nback to episode five of Capture the Flag across Japan. We're a few hours into\nround three  and with Scotty safely\nback in Tokyo Station  both teams have scored\ntheir near flags. Now  all eyes on me! I've captured Ben and Adam's\nsecond flag up here in Niigata  and all I need to do is\nget it back over the line without getting caught. That's gonna be tough  because Adam is right on\nmy tail heading towards me on the exact same line I need to\ntake to get back to Tokyo Station. But with minutes to spare  I think I've cooked up a plan\nthat can get me out. Okay  I think I've\ngot it figured out. And it's so complicated that I'm not\neven sure I can explain it right. And I'm not even sure\nif I have this right. It's very complicated. So basically there's\none of two options. Either Adam gets off\nat Urasa Station to cut me off on the Shinkansen  knowing that I'm gonna— Oh man. Can I even explain this? I might— This might\nneed to be in VO. Hi there  it's Sam from\nthe future with VO  to explain my complicated\nbut kind of awesome plan. Right now  I'm on a\nShinkansen headed south. Adam is on the same\nShinkansen line  but headed north. Now  I have two routes back\nover the midpoint. The first is that I\nget off here in Nagaoka and take a regional line\nto Jōetsu over the line. The problem is \nthere's a 15 minute wait between when I can get\noff the train at Nagaoka and when I can get on\nthe train to Jōetsu. And in that time  Adam will\narrive to Nagaoka to catch me. But here's the thing  and this is\nthe especially complicated part. Adam's train will leave its\nlast stop before Nagaoka – a station called Urasa –\nat 11:44. But my train will leave from\nNagaoka one minute later. That means if Adam\nstays on his train and heads to Nagaoka\nto try to stop me  I have one minute to\nrealize what he's done  and can decide to\nstay on my train and pass him right\non the Shinkansen  taking me across the line \nscot free. And if he gets off at Urasa\nto try to prevent that  I can just do my first plan: get off at Nagaoka and take\nthe regional line to Jōetsu. Basically  as far as I can tell  I found a no-lose scenario \nno matter what Adam does. And as you're about to see  he's only figured out\nhalf of my plan. Okay  so I'm almost certain\nthat I figured out Sam's plan. I think that he's gonna\ntry to get to Jōetsu. Right here. But in order to do that \nhe's gonna have to go to Nagaoka first. And then he can leave\nat 12:01. I'm gonna get to Nagaoka\nat 11:54. My guess... is that he is going\nto try to use a tower in order to avoid getting caught. So I think I should\nbuy a tower now so that I could potentially slow\nhim down enough to catch him. Tower deck. Shuffle. Lightning Tower. On the tens of each hour \nyour opponent must roll a die. If the number is one \nthey are tagged. Okay. Okay. So as I board my train  Adam has a\nmostly useless tower and only knows half my plan. I'm home free. After all  this plan\ntook me a half hour looking at maps and\ntimetables to figure out. There's no way Adam can crack it\nin the next five minutes  right? Okay  wait a minute.\nI just realized he could jump me. He could jump me.\nHe could continue past me. Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait. Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait. Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait. To Urasa Station. Oh  oh  oh. He would get there... 11:58  after me. Okay  so Adam\nfigured out the plan. But even still  he doesn't\nhave any way to stop it. Right? I'm 70% sure that this plan is a\nguaranteed path to victory. But it's really complicated. So I'm worried I might be\nmisunderstanding something. I really don't think that he has\na way to block me at this point. But I know I'm gonna look like\nsuch an idiot if he does. If I... keep going past Urasa... he can keep going\nand pass me. I need a tower.\nI need a tower. I need a tower  shoot. Okay. Oh  my god  okay. Alright  here we go. Shuffle. Trap Tower. If opponents are texted\n\"trap!\" in this area  they are frozen for 30 minutes. Opponents do not need to be\ninformed of this tower's placement  but if someone says they\nplaced a Trap Tower  it must be the truth. Trap Tower. Yes  yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes  yes  yes  okay. Alright  either\nI'm about to look like the world's biggest idiot\nor a genius. We'll see. Okay  so what's happening\nis a little bit confusing  but let me try to\nwalk you through it. I am at Urasa Station. Sam is about to be\nat Nagaoka Station. Now  from Nagaoka  he has\ntwo ways across the midpoint. One is to connect on a\nregional line and go to Jōetsu. Now  I can get to Nagaoka in time to catch him \nbefore he can do that. But if I continue to Nagaoka... he can stay on his train\nand just jump me on the track down to Urasa\nand then score that way. So the plan is this. I'm going to drop both\nthe Lightning Tower – which I'll have to tell him about – and the Trap Tower\nsecretly at Urasa. Then I'll continue up. He'll think that he can\njust pass down through. But he can't.\nHe'll be frozen. Then he'll have three times that\nhe might get struck by lightning. And I'll be able to go after him. (sigh) This is gonna rock. Alright  Adam's\npulling into Urasa now. So now he's gotta decide \ndoes he stay on or get off? And I don't think\neither's the right option. Alright  I'm at Urasa. I've just told them that I'm\nplacing down the Lightning Tower. But I am also placing\ndown the Trap Tower. But Sam won't know that\nuntil I spring the trap. Adam has arrived\nin Urasa Station. Kind of hope he continues on. That'll make a quicker run for me. But on the other hand \nthe other run will be on a nice  small regional line \nwhich I haven't been able to do yet. Ooh  he dropped a thing. Interesting. What is it gonna be? Oh  that's not too bad. So let's see if he gets off. Okay  so the timing of this  I mean  this is a matter of... I mean  less than a minute. Sam is just now finding out\nthat I am headed to Nagaoka. Alright. That means  I assume\nthat he is saying  \"Oh my gosh  I can jump Adam.\"\nHe thinks I'm an idiot. He's gonna jump me\nand go down to Urasa. But when he does that \nI will trap him. Oh. Adam has continued on. That means I am\nstaying on this train. The thing is  that tower\nonly has a one-mile radius. There's actually no guarantee\nthat I'm even within it on the tens of an hour. And even then  it's\nonly a 1-in-10 chance. There he goes. There he goes  okay. That is what I thought. Alright  we're\nabout to pass each other. For the sake of him not\nnabbing me through the windows  I'm gonna go hide. We're about\nto cross each other. That's— Sam was on that train. And he believes... that he's just pulled\nan incredible move. But in seven minutes \nhe will be so sad. Okay  well  this is not good. I have to get out. Man  that sucks! That's the one\nthing they could do. Oh. And now the next train here\nis not for an hour. And Adam's gonna be on it. Man  that was a lucky pull. And they got it yesterday too! Ugh. (cackles happily) We got him  baby. (chortles mockingly) Mmmm! Ohhh. Oh  it feels so good! (stifled giggling) Let's absolutely go! Okay  I made it\nback to Tokyo Station with the flag. Untagged. Very happy about that. There's one thing I have to do. Celebratory drinking of the flag. That's really good. Okay  I do not have enough coins even to get all the\nway out to our flag. I need 3 280 coins. So I either need to do a\nchallenge or go on defense. Let me see where they're at. Sam looks like he's hurting. Adam's heading off Sam. Ben's back here with me \nin Tokyo Station. Okay  so what are\nyou gonna do  Ben? That's going to dictate\na lot of what I do. Alright  well  I made it\nback to Tokyo Station three minutes after Scotty. Well played. Honestly  you deserve that flag.\nThat was crazy. Now that I've made it\nback to Tokyo Station  the idea is that I'm gonna\ngo back on offense... and finish the challenge that\nI started before I got tagged  which is the Mario items one. Okay  so what happened\nnext is kind of boring and also kind of complicated  so we're just gonna\nfast-forward a bit. Basically  Scotty ran into Ben\nat the train station and decided to follow him. I can just\nfollow you  right? That led Ben to take a train\nback into his own territory to get away from Scotty \nso with nothing else to do  Scotty decided to do a challenge. He pulled\nMeet Your Local Yuru-chara  which are these little city mascots\nthat are all over Japan  and headed to Akihabara\n– Tokyo's anime capital – to look for one. Despite going to multiple stores  he was not successful. Do you have yuru-chara? No  I don't. Sorry.\nNo? Okay  thank you. Do you have yuru-chara? No? Okay. Arigatō gozaimasu. Sumimasen.\nHai? Do you have yuru-chara? Yuru-chara?\nYeah. Oh  yuru-chara. Any. Ah  no  no.\nNo? Yeah  sorry.\nOkay  okay  thank you. Ooh  crap. Meanwhile  Ben headed back\ntowards offensive territory to earn coins to make a\nrun for the middle flag  but on his way  decided to stop\nto see if he could catch Scotty. Okay  you know what? Scotty is right at the station\nthat I'm about to go through. So I think I'm just gonna pop out and try and get him on my way. Scotty got freaked out\nand started running away  deciding to veto his challenge  figuring he could wait out his\njail period while he evaded Ben. If I'm gonna hike \nI may as well hike while I'm in a veto period. Alright  I'm declaring a veto. But Ben took one look at this  and figured he wouldn't be able\nto find Scotty here anyways. Oh  I'm never\ngonna find Scotty here. Okay  this is just a waste of time. So he got on a train and\nheaded into enemy territory to knock out his challenge. While Ben made his way\nto Shimbashi Station to look for Mario Kart items  Scotty ran out his veto clock\nand went on the hunt for Ben. Okay  it looks like\nBen got off at... Shimbashi Station. So I'm thinking he's probably\nout doing a challenge right now. If you are  Ben  I can't wait to take\nthose coins from you. Oh  just in time. Okay  I made it to Shimbashi. All I have to do is\nfind a grocery store... get a mushroom \na banana  and shells. Seemingly  there's a grocery store in or right outside of the station. So I'm trying to figure out\nhow to get there. Knock this out as\nquickly as possible. Alright  okay. Banana. That's one down. Okay  at Tokyo Station. Alright  Ben \nwhere are you at? He seems still at the station. Sumimasen. Shimbashi? No  okay.\nArigatō gozaimasu. What the heck train\ndo I need to get on? Mushrooms. Something with a shell. Oh wait. If I pay for these in cash\nand then get a coin back  then I'll have all three. Arigatō gozaimasu. But where's Ben? Still there. I think? Oh  nope. Where'd you go  Ben?\nOh  you're back here. Hi. Let's go find you. Where are you going? Alright  I just gotta transfer\nto platform four. And then I've got two trains... headed to flag number two. I won't have enough to get back  so I'll have to do another\nchallenge along the way  but I just want to get going. Where are you? You are this way. Do I see Scotty? Yeah  Scotty's over there. Well... Let's not let him see\nwhere we're going. Here we go. Oh  he's gone.\nWhere'd he go? He headed back north. That's annoying. Well  I'm stuck here. And it's noon. So... Might as well see\nif I'm tagged. Well  I'm not tagged at least. But  I'm gonna be stuck\nhere for quite a while more. Damn. That's kind of incredible. Both yesterday and today \nthey pulled the best tower. (sigh) Okay  there we go. I bought myself\nten more minutes. Alright  I'm trying to\nfigure out next steps. To be honest  I don't know if I\nhave many options at this point. But there are very\nfew trains from here  and Adam can get on\nmost of them. We'll see. Okay  so here's the best plan\nI was able to come up with. There's a southbound Shinkansen\nheaded through here soon. Adam is probably going\nto get on it at 12:47  because if he doesn't  I could get on it and head\nsouth over the midpoint. But at the same minute Adam\nwould get on that train  there's a slow regional line\nheading north to Nagaoka  the station where Adam is now. When Adam gets on\nthe Shinkansen  I'll be on that and ride\nit up towards Nagaoka. He'll be able to beat me\nthere by taking a Shinkansen  but when he does  I can probably just turn back\naround on the regional line. Essentially by going\non this regional line  I can force him to ping-pong\nback and forth in the Shinkansen  at worst wasting his time  and at best getting him to\nslip up and let me through. Alright  safe another ten minutes. Of all the places\nto get frozen at  I like this one.\nIt's a really cool town. See  there's a little\nski hill over there. You can see some snow left over\nin the distance over there. Very cool. Time for another roll. Alright  we are safe once again. Nice! Alright  I'm freed\nfrom the freeze  and I have about 15 minutes until the train I want\nto take outta here. So I'm gonna just go check out\nthe outside for a second. When you ever get to be in the\nmiddle of the mountains in Japan? This is cool. Those mountains. Cool. Look at just how\nelevated these rails are  and how big of a setup that is. Kind of incredible\nthat they have that for hundreds of miles\nacross the country  but that's how they make\nthe trains go vroom. This house has a\nlovely little garden right next to the\nmassive train station. I wish I had more time to explore  'cause this place is awesome  but... gotta get on that train. Try to see if I can\nfake Adam out and waste a little\nbit more of his time. Time for another roll. Oh  safe still  wow. We're getting lucky with these. Oh? Well  that makes sense. So he's taken a regional line north. Not shocking  I guess. But... He's trapped over here. Oh (bleep) Oh no. Oh  god dammit. Okay. Damn it  okay. Here's what just happened. Okay  so I just messed up. Basically  the tracker\nwas being a little weird  and it looked like Adam didn't get\non the Shinkansen headed south. Meaning I thought\nI had the chance to get off the regional train\nat the first stop and run the two miles back\nto the Shinkansen station just in time to catch it\nand return the flag. The problem is  as you just saw  it turns out Adam did\nget on the Shinkansen  meaning I'm now\nstuck at this station whose only trains go back to Urasa \nwhere Adam is about to arrive  or will go stop at Urasa  again  where Adam is about to be \nbefore getting to me. Basically  I'm now just about\ncompletely trapped. So anyway  that was a\nlong shot anyway. But I guess that\nmeans that I'm in full \"Let's waste Adam's time\" mode. (whispering)\nLook at that. Look at that. Okay  so it seems as though\nhe's just kind of hanging out... at a place called... Yairo Station. I mean  I could walk there. If he really is there. He could get on a train\nheaded back here... in 11 minutes. Okay  okay. Then this one goes up 1:52. Okay  fine. Okay  fine  yeah. Hang out at Yairo. No worries. Hang out at Yairo. I'll hang out here  and then... You won't take a train over here. That'd be stupid of you \nthe 1:15. But I'll wait here\nand see if you do. But if you don't... There are no more trains at\nthat station for a half an hour. I'll just run there. Fine  cool with me. Cool with me  dude. Let's see. What's the plan  Sam?\nYou wanna go straight for me? You totally can. But it's probably\nnot your best move. But what is your best move \nmy man? What is your best move  man? Because if you stay there \nI'm coming for you! You're screwed. You're screwed is what I'm saying. What's up?\nHey  Scotty. I just did a small\ngamble that the— and the tracker led me wrong. Which is fine  it was a\nreal long shot anyways. Good news is  it is\nvery picturesque here. There's snowcapped\nmountains in the background. Oh my god. Bad news is—\nThat sounds amazing. Yeah  bad news is I kinda\njust want to go for a hike and waste Adam's time. But it is raining.\nYeah. Sounds like y'all've gone\non an adventure. Don't get caught.\nYeah. That's your only plan.\nJust don't get caught. Yeah  pretty much. I think we're both just trying\nto waste time  pretty much. Yep. Sounds good.\nAlright. Bye.\nHave fun. Alright  this is now\nProject Waste Adam's Time. Looks like staying to me. Alright. It's a three-kilometer run. Let's go for it. Man  this would be much\nbetter if I had a raincoat. If I had a raincoat \nor it wasn't raining  I would just walk into eternity. But I don't wanna give\nmyself hypothermia  'cause it is kind of cold out. That would not be a\nviable winning strategy. (laughs) I wanna get there\nwith a little bit of margin. 'Cause I'm assuming he's\ngot a tower waiting for me. Oh  you know what? I think I have the budget. Might as well pull a tower\nand mess with Adam. Yeah  I have 870.\nLet's pull a tower and drop it. That way he won't get\nin my budget at least. Okay. Jail Tower. Jail Tower. Opponents may only leave\nthis area after rolling doubles. They may only roll a die\nevery five minutes. Whew. Okay  well that was\nabout what I expected. I have to roll doubles. (bleep) Look at these gardens.\nThese are delightful. This is genuinely delightful. Wait a minute! I misread the card! The card does not say\nI can't move in the area. It just says I can't leave the area. I can move in the area all I want! Oh  Sam  you're (bleep)-ed! Alright  Adam's at the\nother side of the station. Alright  this game is about to just\npurely turn into hide-and-seek. The train station's up there. Yeah  it's gotta be this. Where is he? I just spotted him. He was on that bridge. Where is he? Not in there. Where is he? Shows him right up there. Shows him right up there. Where... would that be? This little bridge\nhas come in clutch. What the hell? He must be hiding. He can't get out.\nHe can't get on a train. Oh wait  was that him? Is that a car? No  I think that was a car. I mean... The tracker makes it look like\nhe's just behind this thing. Alright  he's gonna come\nrunning right there in a little bit. There he is! Oh  he was under the tracks! Ohh. Alright. That... is Sam Denby. Did you enjoy your run? Yeah  it was... really annoying. I don't know why you did that. Why  what do you mean? Why did you run? Because if I hadn't run... you could have gotten\non a train going north. There was— but\nthere was only one train. The one that you could have taken. I am now realizing that. (chuckles) I guess that one did go north. Yeah. So it would've\ngone through my station. Yeah. Well... This was fun though. Yeah? (coughing chuckles) Yeah  that train would've left\nfrom that station  wouldn't it have? Alright  gimme the flag. Oh. Thank you. Alright  what\nare you doing  Ben? What are you doing? Okay  so  I need to figure out... how to intercept Ben. I think Shinjuku is the place to go. Yep. Yep  bingo. Okay  Shinjuku. Alright.\nI made it to Shinjuku. It seems like they're\nnot after me yet  which is great. Now  I've got about\n15 minutes until my next train. So I think what I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna pull my\nnext challenge. And I won't be able\nto do it on the train  but I'll be able to strategize  figure out a way to do it\nas quickly as possible when I get to the second flag. Okay  we're doing another awkward card shuffle. And we're gonna pull the top one. Clean up three\npieces of litter. Each piece of litter\nmust be equal to at least the width or\nvolume of a quarter. Each piece of litter\nyou collect must be at least ten feet apart from any other\npiece of litter you collect. Clean up three\npieces of litter. (laughs) That might be hard. Because this country\nis so dang clean. But  mostly it should\nbe not too bad to do... when I get to the second flag. So that should be pretty quick. I'm not too worried about that.\nI'm pretty happy. (softly) Alright \nI made it on the train. We're headed for flag number two. Good bye \ngreater Tokyo area  finally. Okay  he is heading out. I gotta get on the next train. Scotty is coming after me. And he's gonna arrive before I'll be able to get\nthe flag back onto a train. So I don't really have\nan escape route yet. But what I can do is... I can keep doing challenges\nwhile I evade Scotty  and then buy towers until... I've made the area so\ninhospitable that... I'll have a way to get\non a train and get out. Not the greatest plan... but kind of my only option\nat this point. I thought I was gonna\nhave more margin  but... Yeah  he caught up. (sigh) It is absolutely\ngorgeous here. Spectacular. See  this is the train that\nyou could have taken  Adam. Yeah  I could've taken that.\nYeah. Yeah  I didn't\nthink about that one. You wouldn't have\nbeen able to experience— I mean  this countryside  of all the places that\nyou could have froze me  I'm very grateful\nyou froze me here. Yeah  you're welcome. How did you feel about\nmy little trap there? Were you feeling really good when\nyou passed me on the Shinkansen? I was feeling pretty good. I was so excited when\nI realized what I could do. It was such a\nguaranteed path to victory with such a tiny  tiny way\nto close it down. Oh yeah.\nThat's so annoying. Okay  so I am\nactually realizing I can't leave this area\nuntil I roll doubles. It's definitely been five minutes. When is the train that we\nneed to get on from here? 2:30  so if you don't get it  that is unbelievably bad luck. That'd be bad. Oh?\nOh? Alright  another five minutes. I mean  I have another... I guess seven tries. Yes. But I mean... It's possible. (laughs)\nIt's possible. That would suck. Alright  you get another roll. Alright  trying again. Heyyy! Congrats. Alright  I can\nnow leave the area. I only had six more tries. (humming) (backpack zipping) Choo-choo. Oh  we gotta press the button. This is such a\nnice train for a rural... Imagine if—\nYeah. Just imagine if trains. I know.\nYeah. (stammers) Truly  imagine if trains. Yeah  that'd be nice. (humming) Okay  here's the plan.\nI'm getting off at this stop. We're gonna try and do our\nchallenge as quickly as possible. We're gonna buy a tower \nand we're gonna go from there. I don't know if this is gonna work. This feels kind of\nlike a crazy plan  but I've got nothing better  so... Let's just see if this works. Oh. Japan  I need you to\nnot be so clean right now. Oh my god  it's immaculate. I'm not seeing a\nsingle piece of trash. None. Oh. Trash number one. Looks like\nhe's doing a challenge? That's my best guess. I thought he would\njump back on the train  but maybe he doesn't have\nenough coins  I dunno. Oh  trash number two. If I can... Trash number two. Piece of trash\nnumber three  okay. Let's buy a tower. Let's buy a tower. Oh  they're sticky. I spilled a lot of coffee\nin my bag yesterday  and so my towers are\nkind of sticky  but... Gonna pull the top one. Mud Tower. Mud Tower. All opponents must walk sideways. Okay  this one's not terrible. I'm just gonna throw\nit down right now  'cause I might as well. 'Cause it's got a big radius  and it's gonna slow\nScotty down a lot. Great  okay. I'm gonna let him know. Oh  Mud Tower. All opponents must walk sideways. Oh my god  okay. That's gonna kill me. My plan is to drop a tower as well  but from the train\nas I go by him. So I'm gonna draw a tower right now. I'm gonna go for this one. Pizza Tower  yes! Pizza Tower. Opponents may only move in\nthis area while holding pizza. That's amazing. That is hands-down the\nbest draw I could've made. Okay. That's so good. Okay  so Scotty's\ngonna be here before the next train that\ngets me closer to the flag. Flag's two miles away \nso I'm gonna have to walk. Because if I wait around\nhere to take that train  he's just gonna get me. So... Since Scotty can only walk\nsideways  if I walk to the flag  he's gonna have a\nhard time keeping up. But we're gonna pull\nour next challenge  and... hope it's a good one. Spend exactly 940 yen. You must pay in cash. If you go over this amount \nyou must start over. You may not use a tip or\noffer to pay more or less than an item's usual value. You may not buy anything\nby weight or volume. Spend exactly 940 yen. Oh  we're slipping. This doesn't get us a ton \nbut it should be pretty easy. And also  I desperately need food  so we can do this on the way. But we just gotta start making\nour way towards the flag. So  we're going on\na little adventure. Okay  I'm placing it\nthere at the intersection. I think that covers\nthe most rail stations. I'm gonna drop it when\nI actually go by  but... That will really screw him up. But also  I gotta walk\nsideways to go catch him. Hopefully he doesn't\nalready have pizza. With Scotty hot on his tail  Ben managed to spend exactly\n940 yen at this vending machine  spent those coins on another tower  and began to make his way\ntowards the flag. But well before he could get there  Scotty arrived in Kōfu and\nthrew down the Pizza Tower. That meant Ben had to\nstop whatever he was doing and go directly to the nearest\nplace where he could buy pizza  which unfortunately for him  was right back near Kōfu Station. So now  it's a race. Can Ben buy a slice of pizza\nat this pizza place and safely reroute\nback to the flag? Or is Scotty gonna manage\nto tag him while only being able\nto walk sideways? This is really silly. I think I do want to go after him \n'cause he has to find pizza. But once he finds pizza \nhe can do whatever he wants. I wonder if I throw\ndown another tower. I have the money. Let's do that. Okay. I got Jail Tower. Jail Tower. Opponents may only leave\nthis area after rolling doubles. They may only roll a die\nevery five minutes. Okay  cool. That's great. That will work. And we're just gonna\ndrop that right now. Okay  now I just chase him\nvery  very slowly. Here I come  Ben. Looks like Adam is nervously\nsending strategy to Ben right now. I'm putting in a\ntakeout order for pizza at a— Really? Maybe. It seems like regardless \nScotty is closing in on Ben. Yeah  but he can\nonly walk sideways. Yeah  but Ben\nhas to go get pizza. We'll see. Oh  sumimasen.\nSumimasen. Okay. That is the pizza place. Okay  where's Scotty? Almost there  Adam. (breathing heavily) I'm only a couple blocks\nbehind him. C'mon  turn green. Okay. I saw him. Just don't think\nI was close enough. They're on the same block. Uh oh. Okay. Ah (bleep) I just went to a pizza place \nand it was closed. So  now I'm going to\nanother pizza place. (bleep)  now I'm\nmoving towards Scotty. Currently Ben seems to be\nmoving in the direction of Scotty. It's a bold strategy. It's a bold strategy. (breathing heavily) Parkour! We can't be\ntalking more than... several feet at this point  right? There he is. That's it. Ooh... tough. Pizza Tower. It's a powerful tower. Oh  that sucks. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Alright  so we're closing in\nat the end of the season  and we tried to think of some\nway to set up this ad read  but we cannot think of any\npossible way to set it up without spoiling everything. So all we're gonna say is... the next episode is available\nright now on Nebula. And that is all\nwe can say about it. And also on Nebula \nyou can listen to this week's episode of\nThe Layover  which is our weekly recap podcast. We get on a call with Scotty. We talk about what\nhappened this week. And this week is a fun one  because I retroactively figured out that it actually was really\nsmart for me to run after Sam. And that something bad could have\nhappened if I didn't do that. And I will explain why it was\nactually really smart of me on the podcast. I'm gonna force the audio editor\nto cut that out or something. It will stay in! I'm gonna be the autocrat. Manni  it stays in! And in addition\nto these boys arguing  Nebula has a lot more to offer  like lots of great original series\nfrom your favorite creators. I mean  we've put up whole\ndocumentaries on there. Yeah. The first project we\never worked on together  Alaska's Silent Summer... Very different.\nVery different. Very depressing. But it's on Nebula. But depressing in a good way. Depressing in an interesting way.\nI'm very proud of it. Yeah. Brian from Real Engineering \nour season one and four guest  has a series called\nBattle for Britain that's great. Joseph from RealLifeLore\nwas our season two guest. He has this series\ncalled Modern Conflicts  that people are\ntotally obsessed with. There's so much good stuff on there. And it's more jam-packed\nwith quality content than any other streaming\nservice I personally pay for. So  I say it's totally worth\nthe price of a subscription. Yeah  really\ngood value for money. And a lot of  in my\nopinion  why it's good is because it was founded\nand continues to be run and owned by creators. So  you know  a lot of the\nidea was we thought that creators themselves \nthe people making the content  would've a better understanding\nof how to make a platform that both  you know  incentivized\nthe things you want to incentivize for creators to make good content. And also  you know \ncreating an ecosystem that is a better viewing\nexperience for the audience. Us creators came together\nand we were like  \"How do we make it better?\" And the answer was\nbasically two things. We're gonna create a better\nexperience for the audience through everything we've\nkind of just mentioned. By the way  all of this is\nad and sponsorship free. There are no ads or\nsponsorships on Nebula. So it's just the\nviewing experience itself  super simple and super good. But it's also  you know \na better deal for the creators. And a lot of that is\nabout the fact that when you sign up using our link \nnebula.tv/jetlag  we get a portion of\nyour subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed. Which means we have stable \nrecurring monthly revenue that we can rely on to\nreinvest in the show and make it bigger and\nbetter and cooler and more frequently\nand everything. If you use our link \nyou'll actually get $20 off an annual subscription  which makes it come out to\ntwo and a half dollars a month  I think  which is really not a lot to\npay for Jet Lag early by itself  but then it comes with the entire\nrest of the streaming site. So  very good deal for you.\nVery good deal for the creators. So  sign up at\nnebula.tv/jetlag and thank you in advance\nfor your support. Bye!"

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nto episode six of our four-day game of\nCapture the Flag across Japan. We're now approaching\nthe end of day three. Having lost the first two rounds  Scotty and I are desperate\nto win round three  whose three points\nwould tie the game and force a fourth\nsudden death round. So far  things are\ngoing moderately well. Last episode \nI was stopped by Adam on my way back to return\nthe mid-field flag  which sucked for me \nbut didn't suck quite as much as Ben getting caught less than\na mile from his mid-field flag by a sideways-running Scotty  putting my team in the lead\nif this round ties  as tied rounds are\nwon by whichever team has transported unscored flags\nthe furthest distance. Something Adam \nwho was escorting me back to my jail period at Tokyo Station  was not thrilled about. That sucks. Yeah  that does suck. It's gonna take him a\nwhile to get back to Tokyo. Ohhh  that sucks. 'Cause it puts you guys\nin the lead. Yeah. Because you've transported a flag... Yeah. ...some distance \nand Ben has not. Shoot. Well done  good sir. Jesus Christ. That was a heck of a chase. It is very scary to have a\nman running at you sideways all over town while you're\ndesperate to get pizza. I've gotten\nso many weird looks. I know. Well  I'm back to Tokyo. Just for the\nsake of the segment  we need to do a little\nsideways walking together. Okay. Oh yeah  this is not pleasant. Yeah. I'm not gonna do this anymore \n'cause I don't have to. Oh  I do have to do—\nGoddammit. Yeah  you do have to. That's unfortunate.\nI'll see you at the station. Yeah. Good bye  Adam. Gotta get out so\nI can do challenges. Keihin–Tōhoku \nKeihin–Tōhoku  oh. Here we go. 20 minutes left\nin the day here. Try and knock out a challenge. Good shuffle. Catch a Pokémon. Purchase anything with an\nimage of a Pokémon on it. You must clearly identify\nwhat Pokémon it is. You may not use your phone\nto research the location of any stores that may\nhave Pokémon. Alright  catch Pokémon. Alright  that should\nnot be too hard. I've seen a lot of\nPokémon around. Pokémon  Pokémon  Pokémon. ♪ Pokémon  gotta catch 'em— ♪ ♪ It's you and me ♪ No  none of these magazines\nhave Pokémon on them. They seem to mostly have\nsort of scantily clad women. That is not a Pokémon. ♪ I know it's my destiny ♪ None of these are Pokémon. ♪ —Teach me  and I'll teach— ♪ Seems there's not really\nany Pokémon— Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo. Oh  that's a Pokémon\nright there  baby. This is Miraidon. I bet I can prove it\nin just a second. Miraidon. Yeah  this is Miraidon. Arigatō gozaimasu. I have bought this thing\nwith a Pokémon on it. Challenge complete  boom. Ready  and... Show off your chopstick skills. Transport 30 grains of rice \none at a time  from one container to\nanother with chopsticks. If you drop any \nyou must start over. Okay. I think I can also do this. No problem. Rice  rice  rice  rice. Cups. Chopsticks. Arigatō gozaimasu. Let's do this thing. One... in  easy. 30. (sigh) Done.\nChallenge complete. That was annoying \nbut I got a lot of coins. So I'm cool with it. Alright  the day ends\nin one minute. But that's enough time for me\nto just draw the next challenge. And  you know \nI'll do it in the morning. Eat wagyu. You may eat any amount\nof wagyu. You may not eat raw meat. Anything labeled as\nwagyu counts. Ugh. (sigh) Okay  well... That might be hard in\nthe morning at 7 am. Good night  see you in the\nmorning at this exact spot. Now  it's the rest period. Everyone stops what they're\ndoing for the night  goes to bed  and we start back where we were\nat 7 am the next day. Scotty and Ben are still on\ntheir pretty long journey back to Tokyo Station. So they won't be\nback in the game until a little ways into tomorrow. Until they get back \nit's just Adam trying to earn enough coins to\nmake a run for the far flag  and me trying to stop him. Alright  7 am. Name of the game today: the best offense is a good defense. Here's the thing  if this round\nwere to end right now  we would win  'cause we\nhave the distance advantage. We've transported our\nsecond flag further. Our best path to victory\nwe think at this point is to just shut down\ntheir offensive runs. Both Scotty and I \njust doing everything possible to tag and prevent them from\nmoving their flag  even a little bit. But we think we can do that. So that's what we're gonna try. Alright  7 am  let's go.\nWe gotta find wagyu. Ooh  okay. Okay  four minutes away. Could work. Alright  which way? This way  alright. It's gonna be interesting\nto see what Sam does  if he tries to\ncome after me or not. If he does come after me  I'm gonna drop my\nVampire Tower here. Oh yeah  by the way  Adam drew a Vampire Tower\nway back yesterday  but we lost the footage. But yeah  he has a\nVampire Tower  which means if I'm\nin its radius  I lose 50 coins every minute. That would make it\nso that he loses coins every minute he's in here \nwhich should probably scare him off. Let's see what he does though. Adam's down in Shimbashi. Let's see if we can go grab him. This place is open  and I\nthink it does actually have wagyu. Hi. Wagyu? Wagyu.\nWagyu. Okay  how does this work? Sumimasen. Ah. Wagyu  yes. Okay  it looks like\nSam is coming for me. Trapping. Leave  leave. Get scared and leave. Get scared and leave. Get scared and leave. Arigatō gozaimasu. Alright  Adam just\ndropped a Vampire Tower. So every minute\nI'm here  I lose 50 coins. I have 250  so I can\nhave five minutes  but the balance is also\nallowed to go negative. And I'm not sure I need coins\nfor the rest of the day  so I'm still gonna go after him. The thing is  all I need to do\ntoday is just waste Adam's time. I don't even need budget. This is fine. Alright  he's somewhere\naround the streets here. (huff) Okay  come on. Leave  leave! It looks like he's still here. Okay  he's here. I have to go. Just gonna leave money here. Adam  I'm coming for you! I've caught up a good bit. He's just a couple blocks ahead. He is coming for me. Fine  whatever. I'll run to Shinagawa  if that's really what he wants. If I keep him in here\nlong enough... there's no way he'll ever\nbe able to make a run. I can do this all day. I'm in no rush. Adam is. He must just be\ntrying to slow me down. I guess it's working. Alright  I'm only\na block away. Getting close! Alright  I got some\ngood distance on him now. Okay. Wagyu. Let's try for grocery store. Grocery nearby. Closed  I need 'em open. Cheap groceries aren't gonna do it. Okay  I've got a little\nbit of space here. There he is. Oh  what? Adam! The tracker was wrong. Ah  it always is  isn't it? I think I'm probably gonna go. (exhales weakly) So I'll see you back\nat Tokyo Station? Another round? (bleep) Alright. Quickest way out is over here. Okay  I gotta race back to... Tokyo Station. That was really bad! Here's Adam. Yeah.\nNever trust the tracker. Adam's 30-minute \nwhat are we calling it? Freeze or jail? It's a jail period. Okay. Why do you think they have their\nscience projects in the window? Now I get it  okay. So you guys' plan... is just double defense\nand run out the clock. I 'unno. Okay  okay. Interesting. Today on Choo Choo Chew... we have Pocari Sweat. Terrible name  amazing drink. How would you\ndescribe it to someone who's never had\nPocari Sweat before? (wheezes) Hey  Scotty. Yo! Well  I'm feeling pretty good  because somehow \nAdam was able to get— Adam's challenge pull luck\nseemingly has been really good. He had 2 000 coins on him. Oh my god! A little bit more than 2 000. So I figure I pull a tower now  to just lock in that budget  because I might go back\ninto the Vampire zone. But I don't ha—\nI can go negative all day if I'm not going offensive again. I think the reality of our strategy\nis setting in with Adam. He kind of realized on our\nwalk back to the station what we were kind of up to. I think we need to\nbe prepared for that. So I'm thinking maybe you\nshould come back into Tokyo for maximum flexibility. Yeah. Because we can just\nfollow them all day. Shuffle  shuffle \nshuffle  shuffle. Oh  Vampire Tower. Vampire Tower. Every minute that your\nopponents are in this area  they lose 50 coins. Balance can go negative. That could be useful. Adam's talking to the camera  and he's not letting me\ncome close. I bet it's something like \n\"This sucks.\" (sighs) Well  that was\nvery disappointing. I think the only thing I can\ndo now is try to earn coins. (sigh) I don't know. See if I can find a mall\nin the Vampire zone  where he'd never\nbe able to find me. I'm in full understanding\nof how annoying our strategy is. But it is our best strategy \nso I kind of have to play it. Alright  Adam's on\nhis way to a platform. I'm just gonna see\nwhat train he gets on. I can't get on the same train \nbut at least gives me useful intel. Yeah. Just saves me the time of having\nto cross-reference on Google. I think these are too\nhigh-frequency  Adam. You gotta go for a\nlower frequency one. Shut up! Alright  see you in a bit. No  you won't see me. No  sorry.\nWon't see you in a bit. I believe in you. I am just gonna pop off this\ntrain super fast for one second  so I can pull the card\nand start making a plan. Right  shuffle. Card. Get at least one half mile\nfrom your nearest 7-Eleven. While you may use transit\nto get away from 7-Elevens  you may not be on transit at the\nmoment you complete the card. That sucks. Actually  you know what? I think I know where I can do this. I think if I go to the\nmiddle of the park. Okay  let's run. Kinda looks like Adam\njust tried to fake me out. He went one station down. But I saw that  and therefore\nI didn't get on that train. That would've taken me\ninto the Vampire zone. So I guess I'll go\nmeet him outside again? Adam's right over there  but don't wanna leave him the\ntime to do a challenge  right? That'd be bad for me. Just gonna run. Just gonna run there. Hopefully  Sam can't get to me. But... Not taking any chances\nthis time. Come on  come on  come on  come on! Come on! Come on! Oh  come on. Stupid thing. Alright. Oops  drat. Sumimasen! Sumimasen! Oops! Okay. Into the park. I'mma get some exercise in. Alright  Adam's going\ninto the Imperial Gardens. They're very picturesque. That's where Scotty\nand I drew a landscape. (distant police whistle) No? Walk? Okay. Sumimasen! I'm only allowed to walk? Speed walking. Speed walk. Getting close! It is a gorgeous day to\nbe running around Tokyo. This is lovely. Speed walking. Running  says you can run. It's a little sign. Alright  here we go. Wait  how do I get in? How do you get in? How do you get in? How do you get\ninto the park? I've gone around it \ngone around the park. Where's Sam? Almost got him  I think. Coming for you  Adam! I'm trapped. I'm trapped. I'm trapped. I'm trapped. Just gonna make\na run for it back into— There he is. I thought you said we weren't\nseeing each other soon. Yeah  let's go\nback to Tokyo Station. Morning  Ben. A bit of a rough\nmorning  huh  boys? I've had a great morning. Oy vey. You're on a killing spree  Sam. Yeah. I just needed to get\nmy miles in. What are you doing? I have nothing else to do. No. They're making a plan. I feel like they've gotta\nstart traveling together. I feel like that's their only way  so they can get\nfurther out of Tokyo. I think we should\ngrind out coins together. Since Sam and Scotty can't follow us on a train  I think we should just\ntry and figure out what is the least frequent train\nwe could get out of here on? And it would be\na Shinkansen  right? Yeah  well that's\nwhat I was saying. We should go to Shin-Yokohama. I think that that's right. We'll see if it works. Never count the boys out. Oh  just by the way \nthis was so frantic  nobody explained it \nbut at the last second  Ben and Adam realized\nthe train they wanted to get on left one minute after\nAdam's jail period ended. So they had to make\na run for it. Man  this is a tight sequence. Ben  what happens if\nyou don't make this? Nothing! What's your platform number? Well  that's the right way. 14  14  14  14  14. That way.\nNo  those are the down. Up  okay  up. Oh wait  I need to get a\ntight visual of Adam's face. It's important. Adam  that's your train! Sorry  guys. The next part also\ngot a little messy  but basically Adam and Ben\ndecided to hop on a local line to the neutral zone in\nShinagawa  where they could catch\nthe next Shinkansen  popping out at a stop\nalong the way to draw a card  which was: Visit any museum. Any establishment that describes\nitself as a museum counts. You must gain entry to the museum\nand spend at least 15 minutes there. The 15 minutes starts once\nyou are inside the museum. Visit any museum. We gotta spend\n15 minutes there though. Yeah  but it's 1 000 coins. Okay. Could be worse. Then they made\ntheir way to Shinagawa  where they met a\ncertain special someone  finally arriving from Kōfu. Oh! Hello  gentlemen! Hey  Scotty. It's great to see you.\nI haven't seen you all in a while. I mean  this is a\nsafe zone  obviously. As you know.\nIt is. I do. But I was thinking it\nmight be useful to know where\nyou're headed next. I don't like what's happening. (laughs heartily) This does make\nthings a little sticky. You said you had to\ngo to the bathroom  right? I do.\nAlright  go for it. Do you wanna\nknow why I'm waiting? I think—\nTurn that way. I'm gonna trade off.\nI'm gonna go pee. And then I'll catch up\nwith you guys in a minute. The boys are back in town. That's so true about\nthe boys being back in town. That's a really good point  buddy. I don't like that you\nknow what our plan is  'cause it's the only viable plan. It's gonna work\nthis time though. Don't look at\nmy phone screen  okay? We are winning  alright? Don't condescend to us. Yeah  I wanna point out\nhow smug they're being about the chance that\nYeah  about having lost— they could get a tie.\nYeah. They're so proud of themselves that maybe they could tie us. Who won round one?\nUs. Who won round two?\nAlso us  alright? So why don't we\nkeep that in mind?! The main thing I'm happy about is minimizing the chances of an awfully embarrassing\nthree-round sweep. It's gonna happen. And when it happens  it is\ngonna be awfully embarrassing. And it's gonna be\nawesome when it does. It's not 'our' train. You can't get on it. Alright  this your train? There are no museums\nnear Shin-Yokohama. So we are gonna have\nto go all the way. That's okay. But fortunately there's a\nmuseum right next to the station. There's one\nright next to Odawara. They are going to get... to Odawara... Wait  what? Wait  the Hikari goes to Odawara? Oh. There was another train. Well  let's see where they are. When would they have\nto get on that? (grimaces internally) When would they have\nto get on that? Where's this going? No  it's Hikari.\nWe can get on this one. Oh. Let's do that! I guess let's do that. That's going\nthe right way  right? Yeah  Shin-Yokohama. Yeah  great. Oh.\nAwesome. I almost feel bad. I feel bad too. Oh no-o-o-o... I didn't realize\nthat went to Odawara. There was another train. There was another train. There was another\ntrain that goes to— Folks  there was another train. There was another train \nand it leaves right now. So we might— Our margin is what? I mean our—\nThere is no— Our margin is six minutes. That's not a lot of minutes. How far behind are we? Five minutes?\nEight minutes  I think. Yeah  okay.\nNo  six minutes. Six minutes\nSix minutes behind. I don't... We don't have a lot of options. I don't know what to do  Ben. Well  are they—\nOkay  maybe this is crazy. Maybe the move is to get\ncaught as quickly as possible so that we can start\na new challenge that's not gonna\nabsolutely screw us. 'Cause what are our\nchances of getting it? Well  we could get in there  and then if once it's\ncomplete after 15 minutes  we could pull a tower  and\nmaybe then  we could get out. I'm just saying we\ndon't have a lot of time... to get  you know... We could try to hide\nin the museum. I mean... Let's just try it. Let's just try it.\nWe'll pull a tower. It's worth a try  right? I can't believe there was one \nsix minutes after. Why does Japan\nhave such frequent trains? Japan  make your\ntrains worse  please. Unfortunately \nBen  we do have to run. I'm ready. Every minute matters  'cause we have a six-minute\nmargin as mentioned. We are not allowed\nto hide in bathrooms  but we're allowed to hide in\nany other reasonable place. (chime tones) Alright  let's go. Yeah  come on  come on. Exit  exit... This way. Sumimasen. Sumimasen. How do we get\nout of this place? Okay  here we go. If this way was east \nthis way has to be south. You got it  pal.\nYou got it. I don't know how you\ncan go downstairs so fast. Alright. Alright  alright  alright. Let's do this thing. Done it twice.\nHere we come  boys. Let's do it a third time. You let me know\nwhat speed you want to go. Okay. I'm going\nas fast as I can. That's alright. Oh  you okay? Just do your best! Ohh. Look  we're 300 meters\nfrom the museum. I think that we are most\nlikely going to be able to make it in there. And then it's all about hiding. This is pretty  look at this. Oh my gosh.\nLook at that  Ben. I think that's the castle. Yeah  that's the castle. They're at a castle. I wonder if it's\na touristy castle. Okay. Maybe I should do a speedrun. Yeah. That sounds good. Have fun. Alright  we're almost there. We're only 100 meters\naway  Ben. This is a very small museum. We're totally screwed. Hi. Two. Sumika. Sorry  cash only. Cash?\nCash. I have cash. Thank you very much. Arigatō gozaimasu.\nArigatō gozaimasu. Back in running mode. They're right up there. ♪ (solemn piano) This is just it. It's one room. There's a...\nroom with a screen. Can we hide behind these screens? (whispering)\nIt's totally inappropriate. It seems a little gauche. Only the case  the best we can\ndo is hiding behind this wall. And cash only. Oh  cash only. Thank you. Here you are.\nThank you. Hi. Is there—\nI'm looking for my friends. Oh  friends? Yes.\nFriends? Yeah  two other Americans. Are they— American... (speaking Japanese) Is this the whole area? Oh  down here you think? Check the tower.\nOh  tower? Oh  over there. Okay  thank you. I can't find them. It seems like they're\nsomewhere in this museum. Which'd make sense 'cause\nthere's a museum challenge. I don't see them. Ice Tower. Opponents must roll a die in\ntheir hands to walk in this area. Every time they roll a number \nthey may walk that many steps. They just dropped an Ice Tower. So we have to roll a die\nto walk in this region. Three  four. Three... six. Two  three  four. Thank you. I don't understand. It shows them here. Oh  finally.\n(spurts laugh) I bet that was real\nfunny when I came in. Well  'cause there\nwere guys there. I didn't want to turn my\nflashlight on and disturb them. Well  I just came from outside. I was completely blind. Ugh. I thought— I came back \n'cause I was like  I knew that's something\nthat they would do. You saw \nI turned my flashlight on. They were there and\nI was like  \"Oh  sorry.\" You looked that way. Yeah. Alright  back to Tokyo.\nThat was funny. That was funny.\nAt least we got that. Alright  see ya. You still have to\nroll dice to walk in here. Don't forget that. Yeah. Arigatō gozaimasu. Is the train back\nto Tokyo in nine minutes? I think we can make that \nand they can't. I mean  maybe that'll\nbuy us some time. One  two  three \nfour  five. One  two  three. Man  this dice roll curse sucks. Probably means that\nBen and Adam are gonna get back to Tokyo\nway earlier than us. Well... We're gonna have to\nfigure out a new plan. One  two  three. Looks like it's\nyour first day walking. You're just getting the hang of it. I've gotten\nso many dirty looks. Fairly certain I got\nshamed in Japanese. A man wanted me to go in\nfront of him on the escalator  and I was like  \"No  you\nreally don't want that.\" Well  Ben... Things have not been\ngoing well today. Nope. We are back at Tokyo Station \nback at square one. One  two  three  four. I have enough\nbudget to pull a tower. Yeah? And pretty much  I think\nit just makes sense to do whenever we have the budget\nto do it today  right? You wanna make a pull? Sure. Odd Tower. Opponents may only take\ntrains scheduled to leave at odd-numbered times\nin this area. The number is determined\nby its final digit. Odd Tower. Oh  we already\nhad one of those. We already had one of those.\nWell  it is pretty useful. We're closing on Shinagawa. Do you think I should\nget off there? Well  so I have\nzero coins right now. Yeah.\nSo I think— And we've got that\nVampire Tower. So I think I continue on\nto Tokyo Station at least. But you've still got coins. Yeah. So I think you stop here. No sense in us being in\nthe same spot  really. Yeah  no. Alright  so I'll get off here.\nAnd then let's— It's an easy bounce\nbetween Tokyo Station and here. Yeah  it takes\nfour minutes  yeah. Alright  so yeah. We'll coordinate a bit\nonce we see what they do. So we've been doing\nsome math. Even though Scotty has\nabandoned the second flag  there's basically no\nway for us to get there and get it back in time \nbecause all of the lines are much slower. You would have\nto go the long way up  and I don't think that— It would be two hours\nafter the game ended that we could get it\nover the line. The better move is\nto go for the far flag  and just  if we can get it  I think Sam managed to\ntransport his second flag 40 miles back.\nSo if we could get more than 40 miles back \nwe would win in a tie. That's all we need to do. So  like maniacs  I think we're basically just\nhopping back on the train back to where we just were... and trying again. Well... Yeah. Yeah. But there's a tower there now  and we might pull a\nbetter challenge  and... That's true  don't forget—  didn't even think about that. There's a tower there.\nThere is a tower there. So that's actually a really\ngood area to do challenges now. We're going back to Odawara. Can't resist that Samurai Museum. Although hopefully we're not\ngoing back to the Samurai Museum. Okay  come on  let's go. Okay  now I need to\nfigure out where Ben and Adam are  and hopefully figure out what\ntrain they're gonna get on here. You know what  I'm just\ngonna go back up onto the Shinkansen platform. I think it's very possible\nthey're up there. Yep  there they are. Hi guys!\nWhere are you going? Hi  Scotty. Good bye. Good bye. We're doing the\nvery predictable thing and getting on this train.\nGood bye now. Hey  I just\ncaught up with them. They're on the Kodama\n723 to Shin-Ōsaka. Leaving at 11:57  and it\nstops at all stations. Alright  well  let's look\nfor the next one after that. Okay  hello.\nHi. Basically  this is\nour last opportunity. Yeah  if we don't time\neverything perfectly on this run and do it successfully  then... Yeah  if we get caught again \nthen the round's over. It's game over. We need to earn... a total of just under\n3 000 coins in order to get\nall the way to the flag. But that's total  so 1 500 each. And we would need\nto get on a train at either 1:01 or 1:05. Now  all of this assumes that we also don't\nget caught somehow. I would say that our odds of doing\nall those things are not great. But we are gonna try. Nom. Sam's figured\nit out already. 12:03  just in seven minutes... on platform 14. 511  I think it's already here. It's the one that's\nboarding right now. Hello  Scotty. Hello  sir. Seems like they might be\ndoing the same thing again. I think so.\nYeah. They might not\nhave a lot of options. No. Is there any\nescape from there that doesn't involve coming\nback to that platform? No. Okay  so I— Yeah  so I figure one of us\ncan just post at the platform. The other applies a little pressure. Yeah. Alright. Alright  here we go. Challenge time. Do 100 squats. Your thighs must go to an\napproximately 90 degree angle to the ground for each squat. You may take as many\nbreaks as you wish. If done as a team  the 100 squats\nmay be split between teammates. Well... Okay  this  that's— You know what  that's— It could be worse. We only have to do\n100 squats total. One. Two. Alright  looks like\nwe're going back to Odawara. So we need to get off and transfer. Right  'cause\nthis is an Express. Yeah.\nWill not stop at Odawara. Yep. So it buys 'em a little\nmore time than last time. It buys 'em about 30 minutes  but the next train that\nthey can take out of there would be the one that we\nwould be on anyway  so... I'm not worried about it.\nYeah. 13... 14... 15  starting to feel it. 16. 32. Okay  I need a little break.\nI'm at 32. Ooh. Oh  it's burning. 33. 34. 40  I'm at 40. 43. 50  oh  I'm done. And I want credit.\nYou did your 50? Wait  wait  let me finish.\nI'm at 46. I finished them before Adam.\nI want credit. 49. 50  nice. Let's pull another challenge.\nOkay  good work. If we can do\none more 750  then we have enough\nto make the run. Deck. Go to something interesting. Without researching on YouTube  go to something that has\na YouTube video about it with at least 100 000 views. The YouTube video's title must\neither include the thing's name  or clearly be referencing\nit as its main focus. If you cannot find a video\ncorrelating to your location  you may either retry\nor veto the challenge. Go to something interesting. (bleep) Let's just look at what the\ntop attraction is around here. The Odawara Castle  right? There was that castle. That was a big castle. That was a big old castle. I know. Oh. I know  I know  I know. But we do have to hurry.\nWait  the exit's this way. I know  buddy. We only have 30 minutes. But if we get there\nand we're right  then we have enough\nto make the run. Okay. So we\njust chill here. Finally a new\nstation after our— I know  a new station that\nwe don't have to do something weird to walk around in.\nYeah. Let's go to this\nstupid castle again. It's actually not stupid.\nIt's actually very cool. Oh  those squats make\nthe running so much harder. Let me see. Is this where we turned? Yeah  yeah  we're really close. Oh god  yeah. My legs are really\nfeeling those squats too. Alright  we're at the castle. And so I think that means\nthat we can start looking. Come on. Odawara Castle. I'm not seeing a\nlot of views on these. Yeah  I'm seeing\n2 000 views. 494— Ooh.\nOh  oh. Did you get it? A stunning day at Odawara Castle. Life in Japan 201.\n106 000 views. Thank you  Odawara Castle! Alright. Okay  Ben. We might somehow\npull this off. So we have enough\nto make the run now. And now we're seeing if we\nhave enough to get a tower. Shuffle. Cursed! You may not advance in the game\nuntil you have acquired a melon. If you have not acquired\na melon within 30 minutes  this curse is\nautomatically vetoed. Until the next time\nthat you are tagged  return to your zone \nor the end of the round  you must carry the melon\nwith you. If you draw this curse as a team  both team members\nmust carry a melon. Oh no. We may not advance in the game\nuntil we've acquired a melon. If you've not acquired a\nmelon within 30 minutes— Okay  we need a melon asap. This was what I was afraid of. We have 16 minutes  Ben. Welcome back\nto another edition of Choo Choo Chew. Choo Choo Chew! It's pickled plum. Have you ever had\npickled plum? I don't believe I\nhave had pickled plum. Oh  you're in for a treat. Ooh  that's moist. I guess it is pickled.\nCheers. Cheers. (stifled wheeze) If we manage\nto do this  then... we would have enough\nfor two towers as well. My legs are so (bleep)-ed. Actually  let's\nbuy a tower now. Okay. Buy a tower now \n'cause we will... If we don't pull this off \nthen we're (bleep)-ed anyway. So buy a tower now.\nGimme the camera. You've got the towers\nin your pocket. Okay  here we go. Odd Tower. Opponents may only take\ntrains scheduled to leave at odd-numbered times\nin this area. The number is determined\nby its final digit. Odd Tower.\n(gasp) That might be enough.\nThat might be enough. We have to see if it\nleaves at an odd time. It doesn't! It doesn't! Ben  the train we need\nto get on is at 1:46  which is an even number  so they\nwouldn't be able to get on it. Oh my god  this might work. Oh my god  this might work. Why is—\nDef— (wheezes) So... Oh  no. Palate cleanser.\nThis should be better. This is sheet-shaped\npickled plum. It's just the same thing. It's a different shape. Oh wow  it's like a... I'm not gonna say what\nthat's like actually. If this is LSD  that'd be\na wild finish to the game. (wheezes) Cheers.\nCheers. Okay  that's better. You need a few more to fully get the taste.\nNo. No. Oh wait  this looks\nlike a grocery store. No  this is a\nconvenience store. Okay  you don't think\nthey would have a melon? Okay  okay \nlet's keep going then. No  I don't think\nthey'd have melons. Oh! That looks like a\ngrocery store for sure. There's definitely melons\nin there. Really keep your eyes peeled. This looks promising— oh! There's produce \nBen  there's produce. Oh  melon.\nMelon. Do we both have\nto get one? Yeah  we both have to get one. Okay. Okay we've acquired\nthe melons now. That's enough for us\nto pull another tower. Yeah  pull a tower.\nOkay. Gravity Tower. Opponents can only\nmove in this area while carrying an extra\nfour liters of liquid. Drop it. Yeah  yeah.\nThey'll have to get out. Drop it  drop it  drop it.\nOkay  I'm dropping. They'll have to get out \nand then we can get on. Wait  wait  wait \nwait 'til they're here. Wait 'til they're here. Yeah  yeah \nI'm just getting my pin. They also won't be\nable to tag us. Yeah. Arigatō gozaimasu. Yeah  they're almost here. So if we drop that... It's gonna force\nthem off their train. They won't be able to tag us until they've acquired\nfour liters of liquid. And then...\nWe'll get on their train. We'll get on their train \nand that'll continue on. And then we can transfer  and I don't even think they\ncould make the transfer. No. But if they can  then\nwe'll drop the other tower. Oh my god  this might work. Yeah  they're coming. Melon. We got— That's 2 500 total. Yeah  that's enough\nfor three towers. Let's just pull another one.\nAlright  pull another tower. Mud Tower. All opponents\nmust walk sideways. What is it? Mud Tower.\nIt's another Mud Tower. Okay. I think we probably don't\nwant to use that right now. Yeah  let's save that. So  Ben... The second that it gets in... The second that it gets in... Drop the gravity tower. We need to— Well  we\nneed to wait a second. Let them get off  right? Wait here. Right  give them a few\nseconds to get off. And look for us. So be ready to\npop out immediately  to see if we spot 'em. So we're unclear whether they're\non the Shinkansen track or not. Yeah. Let's just pop out\nto see if we can spot 'em. See if we spot 'em. Okay  they're pulling in. That's the\nsound of their train. Oh  I don't see 'em yet. Okay. Alright  the second\npeople start to come out... Now. Alright  sent. Gravity Tower's deployed. Oh  they just\nhit us with something. Huh? You can't do anything\nwithout four liters of liquid. Alright. So let's get on the train. Okay  but we\ncan place the tower. Let's try hitting\nthem with the tower. Vampire or... I don't know \nwhat do you think? I like them not moving. I think we should put both. Yeah  okay. Okay. Oh  no. Jail Tower.\nJail Tower. Jail Tower. Alright  start rolling. Okay. I'm getting water. We roll two dice.\nHere we go. Alright  get on the train \nget on the train  get on the train. That was a close one. Just get down. I don't know if they might\nhave time to get the water. It's a lot of water. How much are these? These are half liters \nso I need to get eight. Okay. Just make sure they're\nnot on the other side. Yeah. Please go. Please tell me that they\ndidn't get back on it. Alright  we're moving. I don't know\nif they made it on. (whispering)\nWait  stay down. They can still take a picture\nof you from the train. I saw them  I saw them. Alright  four liters of water. One  two  three \nfour  five. Hang on  wait for me  Sam. Yeah  I mean  they\ncouldn't have tagged us until they got the\nfour liters of water  and they clearly didn't\nhave them yet  so... It looks like they\nboth got outta here. How? I think they probably\nslipped onto that Shinkansen when we weren't looking. I think while we were distracted  they probably slipped on over there. Yep. Probably maybe should\nhave thought of that  but I think we were probably banking\non the Jail Tower not making... you know  making it not possible. That's weird. Well  we faced— Let's figure\nout our next train. Yep. Well done  Ben and Adam. I mean  they don't— There's no way they have the\nbudget to get all the way there. Here's the plan. I am going to chase\nBen and Adam on the next train  which arrives in a few minutes. But  we've identified\nthe fact that they could be actually\ngoing after the second flag. Yeah  they\ncould pop out at Fuji and take the slow regional line up. That would get them\nthere at just past 4 pm. But I can actually\nget there at 4 pm just by going back through Tokyo  which is a faster route to that. You're gonna keep chasing\nthem after the third flag  in case they decide to do that. They'll probably have\nto stop for challenges unless they're unbelievably lucky.\nI think so. So it seems like we can close\n'em off from either way. Good luck  Scotty. See you hopefully...\nLikewise. I'll see you for our\nbonus round tomorrow. I think so.\nSudden Death  man. Yeah. It's gonna be embarrassing\nthough  if this ends without that. Yes. We are on our way\nto hopefully victory. Yeah. So we just did the math  and it turns out we just need... not a couple\nhundred more coins to make the full run\nthat we need to do. Yeah  it's 300-something. So we have to do one\nmore challenge at some point. Any challenge. So what we're gonna do\nis we're just gonna pop off the train at the next stop  pull a challenge...\nYeah. And then on\nour way to the flag  we're just gonna strategize\nabout how to do it. And hopefully it's a good one. Yeah  hopefully it's good. I mean  'cause the thing is  if we don't go into Kōbe with a\nplan of how to do the challenge  we won't be able to\nmake it back in time  'cause we have essentially no\nmargin for error when we get there. We have literally one minute\nto make a transfer  and then we have to sprint\nto the flag and back  and that's the only way. So  fingers crossed\nit's a good one. Okay. Alright  Adam. Here I come. Ready?\nShuffle  shuffle  shuffle. Cursed!\nGet on a late train. The next train you\nget on must arrive at the station where you board\nat least one minute late. 14... At 2:31. So if it's still here at 2:32... That might be an\nall-time colossal L. Okay  so Adam and Ben\nhave gotten off at Hamamatsu. Which is the next stop. So I gotta get off there too. Yeah. I think we're pretty much toast. It was gonna be tough\nregardless  but... There goes our train on time. Scotty's gonna be very\ndelighted when he gets here. I mean  should\nwe even bother hiding? I mean... We're not gonna make\nit in time anymore. I mean  there's a 0% chance\nwe're gonna make it in time  'cause we needed to be on\nthat train  which is gone. And we can't even get\non the next one or... Who knows when we\ncould get on a train? Just for fun  do you wanna\nmake Scotty walk sideways? Yeah. (whispering) Ohh... no. They have just informed me\nthey dropped a Mud Tower. I can barely walk normally. I will still catch you. Even if I have to do it sideways. Well  now we\nsimply await death. Who other people call \nScotty from Strange Parts. I got my sideways legs on. Let's do this. What are you doing? What's going on? Hello  you're tagged. Scotty  I think that's\nthe end of round three. But— Oh yeah  you don't know! Yeah  he doesn't know\nwhat happened. (laughs) Yeah he doesn't know.\nOh  Scotty! I just pulled up \nand you're both sitting here  in plain view out the window. Yeah we— Right where I\nhappened to be on the train. We went ahead and\n(bleep)-ed ourselves pretty bad. I did  which\nis why I got off. You wanna see why? Yes  I do wanna see why. It turns out that trains\ndon't really do that here. Well  Scotty  I think we'll\nsee you in the tiebreaker. (giggles) I'll see you there! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus It is all tied up! Three points against three points.

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nto the finale of Capture the Flag\nacross Japan. By the end of this episode  one of these two teams will be\ncrowned the winner of this season. The game was meant to be\nplayed in three rounds  but we ended round three\nin a tie. Both teams have three points  meaning for the first time\nin Jet Lag history  the game all comes down\nto a tiebreaker round. So here's how\nthe tiebreaker works. We've placed seven flags\naround Tokyo  fair game for either team. The first team to successfully\nreturn four of them to Tokyo Station wins. The whole map is a\nno man's land. Players can be tagged\nanywhere at any time. If a player is tagged  they drop\nany flags that they're holding and freeze in place\nfor five minutes. Because of all the\nnew complications  we've also simplified. There are no more coins \nno more challenges  and no more towers. It's all gonna come down to\npure strategy  luck and speed. So without further ado... Okay. Roll. Oh  wow  that's\na lot of cameras. Alright  Jet Laggers. It all comes down to this. We have three hours\non the clock. Seven flags across the map. First to four wins. Ready for this? Alright  let's do it. Three... two... one... go! Alright  Scotty.\nYou always go on the wrong side of the camera!\nSorry! Okay  Ben. Okay  I think we should—\nI think we should go— One of us should go north.\nOne of us should go south. Well  yeah  there's\nnot as much south though. I'm gonna go north\nto this guy  I think. I'm gonna go south. Okay  sounds good \nsounds good. There's this one north. Maybe I should go run for that  'cause I could run it\nback over the line. Okay.\nWhat do you think? I think that sounds good. Are we gonna try and plan any defense right now? I mean  you could play defense. Do you think it's worth you\nplaying defense at this point? Seeing how that works? I think so.\nYou could base— Well  you can wait here and\nsee what they do in five minutes. It's worth trying\nboth strategies. Yeah. And then we'll get a\nsense of which works  yeah. Yep  see ya. I'm gonna try to\nKeihin–Tōhoku to Ōmiya. Keihin–Tōhoku  here we go. Yep. I don't see anybody getting on this. Okay  7:12.\nTrackers just turned on. JK 27. Where are they?\nThe doors on the right side will open. I think Adam's\non my same train. Oh shoot \nis Sam on this train? It looks like Sam's on this train. Okay  I haven't seen\nSam or Scotty yet. This is— Oh  I forgot. It's rush hour in Tokyo. It's gonna be cozy. We're going down to\nShimbashi Station  and then we're\ntransferring to a Metro. I haven't really even\ntaken Metros much yet  so I kind of don't\nknow how to do that  but we'll figure it out  right? Okay  so Ben has gone south. Oh  I bet he's going to\nTokyo Tower. Let's go there. Yamanote Line... Right here  perfect! Oh god  talk about ideal! Now I have to\ntransfer to the Ginza Line and ride that straight\ntowards the flag. Yes  okay. Okay  Ben's\nsomewhere near here. Trying to track him\ndown and tag him. Okay  Scotty's\nheading towards me. So I'm gonna have to keep\nmy eyes peeled for him  because we can both\ntag each other. So I'm gonna have to\nbe as close to me. I'm gonna have to\nbe ready to get him. Okay  he got on the train. Gotta figure this out now. How do I get to that train? Yeah  it's rush— Oh  I gotta get on that train. Okay  I'm on the right train. Yeah  same train. Has to be. I think he's up there. Adam's definitely\non my same train. I'm gonna try to nab him\nat the other station. I'm trying to see if\nhe comes after me. Trying to stake him out. Where is he? He's out on the street. It's just up here. Just to the left. He's right up here. I gotta figure out\nwhat it looks like. Come on. Where is it? This way? This way? Yes  yes. Here. Okay. He's less than a block away. I like this spot. I got shields on both sides. I don't even know\nwhat's in this thing. There we go. (flap rattling) Okay  he's right here. Gonna hide. Gonna hide back here. He knows I have it. He knows I have the flag \n'cause you have to notify. Oh  he retrieved the weird one. Okay. He should be at the\nend of this block. Where is he? He's right here. I'm just gonna\nkind of move around  try to shake him out of his spot. I don't see him. I think I just gotta\nmake a run for it. Okay  back streets. Got him. Got him. See you  sucker! Oh (bleep)  you got me? I got you  it's in the text. Sumimasen. Oh  he got me from behind. Damn  that sucks. Damn! Bad freaking start. Okay  he's just\ngetting to the station now. And I'm one stop behind him. So as soon as this stops  I'll get off and go chase. I just need to figure\nout how to get out of here as quickly as possible. Scotty's right on top of me. So I gotta run. If he pops out of\nthis train place  I gotta be prepared... to get his ass. He hasn't gotten very far. Let's do it. I just don't wanna\nget ambushed here. I'm really worried he's\nhiding behind something. (panting heavily) Yeah  shoot. Either the tracker\nwas inaccurate  or... ...he faked me out. We gotta run. Ooh  my legs are sore! Okay  I made it to the machine. Please. (bottle drops) (coins clattering) Okay. (flap rattling)\nUgh. Pain is only temporary. Winning is forever. Oh my god. (flap rattling) Okay. Okay  we've got the flag. There's a subway ahead of me. So I won't have to head\nback towards Scotty. Hopefully we can make it out. Gotta be careful. He can still ambush me here. Oh  there he is  I see him. (panting) Okay  I'm gonna... I just gotta get a good picture. He's running. I just have to figure\nout my way back. I saw him  but I\ncouldn't get a picture in time. That's the train! This train! Oh! Okay  it left. Oh! (bleep)  okay.\nI have to wait for the next one. Have to hide here. Oh  he's right on top of me. Okay. Gonna have my camera ready. Somewhere here. Where the (bleep) is it? (sigh) What the hell? Here  not it. Okay  can't run inside now. That's my train. I just can't let Scotty get me. If I can get onto this train \nI'm home free with this flag. Sumimasen  sumimasen. Just have to obscure myself. (exhausted breathing) Please leave. It's not him. Ah  crap! I bet he got on this train. Dang it. Okay  this train\nis going the right way. So I think I'm\nhome free with this. (whispering) Let's (bleep) go.\nLet's (bleep) go. Alright  it looks like Adam's\nheading back to Tokyo Station  and I don't think I can catch him. So I think I probably need\nto take the time advantage to grab another flag. I think I'm gonna go\nfor this flag. I like the look of it. Alright  time's up  let's go. Almost there. Few more blocks. Once I cross this street... Done. Woo! Alright  let's go\nafter the next one. Man  he already\nreturned that flag. Almost within the\nfive-minute window  wow. Headed for the subway. Heading up towards the\ntwo northern flags. Basically  at this point \nI'm gonna see what Sam does. Base my decision off of that. Here's a station. Heading north  Ginza Line. Asakusa. Apparently Ben\ngot the slip on Scotty. This is not going great! Alright. I made it back. Tokyo Station  flag scored. But actually this train goes\nstraight back towards Sam. So I'm gonna just hop on it\nand try and defend against him. Yeah  it goes straight to Sam. So I'm gonna go for him. Alright  we got two flags down.\nThey've got none. I'm feeling good. Alright. Flag is just over there.\nI see it. It's really hard to tell\nwhat Adam's up to. His tracker's not very accurate. I don't know if he's coming after me\nor going for another flag. Need more useful info. Okay. So I've decided I'm\ngonna go for both flags. There's one at Ueno.\nI'm gonna get that. I'm gonna get back on this... Continue on \nget the next one... Then head back  and then... That would be four. So... Alright. Alright  let's get outta here. Sumimasen! Exit for Ueno Park  yep. Tokyo? Okay. Arigatō gozaimasu. Actually  you know what? I shoulda just switched to\ngoing and getting a flag. Okay  I'm going to Tokyo Tower. This is saying I should walk. Oh  okay. Yeah  let's do that. Oh crap. Oh crap! I got directions\nfrom the wrong place. Ugh! 'Cause my location sucks. Major self-own here. Okay. Let's get back on it. Wrong way. Oh  this light is killing me. Oh  I need cash \nI need cash  I need cash! Okay. Got! Okay  doesn't look like\nAdam's coming after me  so I think I'm somewhat safe. Okay  Sam has\nretrieved a flag. But... I'm about to retrieve\nanother one  so... Still have the advantage. How do I get outta here? Exit  Ueno Park. Yeah! Ueno Park  okay. Okay. It's like a quarter mile. Where's Sam? Because... I think the smart thing\nfor him to do is come after me. I think I need\nto return this flag... and then we need to go\nhigh risk  high reward. We need to go defensive.\nWe need to block them. You know  steal flags from them. I think that's our best shot\nat this point. Yeah  obviously. There it is  yes! Okay. Fine  coins. Okay  coins  coins  coins. There we go  there we go. Got it. Okay. Alright  put this in the bag. Then let's boogie. Okay. I think the move now... straight to the far flag. Let's get there. Nakamise. Yes. Okay. Let's do it. Where's Sam? Says he's pretty far from me. So... Hopefully I can get on the subway. Ugh. (moan) Adam retrieved another flag. I don't like this! Sam's tracker bubble\nis just way too big. I'll never know\nwhat train he's on  and they're all too crowded. I'm going back.\nI'm just gonna go for a flag. Okay  I actually\ndidn't realize until the last second\nthat I was back  but I scored this.\nThat's great. Oh  Sam got a flag  good. Okay  we're still\nin this to win it. (growls softly) Yeah. Oh  I got on the wrong train. Dang it. Okay. Alright. Back to that same line. I'm gonna go get a third flag. And if I can return those... That's four  we win. But it's risky. 'Cause if I get caught  I'll be handing them over. I'm gonna go see\nif I can cut Adam off. Now I'm navigating the\nmaze of Tokyo Station when I try to find\na train up to Adam. Sumimasen. Sumimasen. Okay  it doesn't know\nwhere Sam is anymore. I don't love that. No idea where Sam is. Alright. Three stops. Just trying to find the platform. Where am I on? Oh  interesting. Adam seems to be\ngoing for a twofer. Okay  that changes the plan. Let's take a look. Unfortunately  he has\na lot of routes back. Here we go. Let's get out. Get the fourth flag. Then if I can get back \nI'm golden. And I have a lot of ways out. Got a lot of ways out. Should be just up here. Blue vending machine on the left. Oh  this is a temple.\nI'm gonna be very careful. I wanna be very respectful here. Can't go under that \nis my understanding. Oh  there it is. Okay. Here we go. (coin drops) (bottle drops) Alright  shopping street\nflag retrieved. If I can just get back\nsafely  that's it. Doesn't look like Sam\nis near me right now. Adam's got two flags  so I'm just gonna\ntry and box Sam out. 'Cause Sam's gonna have\nto go defend against Adam. So I'm here  Sam's here at\nTokyo Station  Adam's up here. So maybe I should get\nmore in-between them. How do I do that? Maybe go to Kanda. Alright  let's figure out\nhow to get there. Okay. Adam retrieved the flag. Now I need to monitor which\ntrain station he goes into to hopefully figure out\nwhere I need to cut him off. The problem is he has\nmultiple options back. And one of the options doesn't\neven come to Tokyo Station. It comes to a Metro station that's on kind of the\noutside of the neutral zone. So I need to be kind of ready\nto run over to that line. And it seems like that's\nwhat he's gonna do. Here's the deal. I'm here in Kanda. If Adam makes it\nback to Tokyo Station with these two flags  we win. Sam's gonna go to\ndefend against him. But  if I wait here  I can block Sam from defending\nagainst him  hopefully. If Sam comes this way  I can try and get on\nhis train and tag him. At the very least \nit should slow him down or make his routes\nmore complicated so that Adam has more time\nto get back to Tokyo Station. That's the plan. Ben is posted\nup at Kanda Station  which is where I was gonna go... presumably to nab me\nif I go for that route. So I think that makes me think that\nAdam's gonna take the Metro route. Maybe  I don't know. Or it's trying to be a fake-out. I'm gonna go on foot. I think there's a spot from which\nI'll be able to run to either line and hopefully cut 'em off\noutside of the neutral zone. Alright  this\nis the key moment. Let's plan an escape route. Hey buddy. Hello? Hello?\nAlright  I have a few options. Yeah  hey  hey  you hear me? Yeah  yeah  yeah. I have a few\noptions back  okay? Now the trouble is I think if I take the\nmost direct option back  they'll be able to identify\nit easily and get me. But if I go to Ueno...\nYeah. There are multiple lines back  and it may be hard for him to\nfigure out which one I'm on. If I get on... Oh  oh  oh  Ben! (cackles) I got it. Okay  I'm all set. Okay  bye  bye!\nBye  bye-bye-bye. Gettin' my jog in. Alright  I'm getting\nto kind of the midpoint between the two lines\nthat Adam could take back. Hopefully I'll have enough time\nto get to either of the lines... after finding out hopefully\nwhich line he is taking. Okay  I'm going to Ueno \n'cause I gotta defend Adam there. If Sam goes there and\ntries to block him  I've gotta get Sam. Alright  here we go! One last run \nif I can just get to Ueno. I don't see Scotty anywhere. Yeah  Scotty's off in\nthe middle of nowhere. Scotty's actually down here. He just retrieved this flag\nand is on his way to return it. That'll put both teams\nat two flags  which means it'll all\ncome down to this. If Adam can score the\ntwo flags in his possession  they win the game. But if I can find a way\nto stop him before he gets back to\nTokyo and steal the flags  we'll also seal the deal. Alright  here we go. Right one out. If I can get on this train \nand it leaves... I'm home free. Looks like Ben\nwent up to Ueno. Ben is smart. Okay  what is the fastest\nway I can get to... somewhere between\nhere and Ueno? So I figured out that almost every\nsingle one of Adam's routes back went through here  Kanda. So I went on a train\nto intercept him. But on the way \nI realized something. They can take a\nzero-stop Shinkansen from Ueno Station\nback to Tokyo Station. Zero stops means\nzero chance to catch them. If they realize that too... we're screwed. Alright  well I made it to Kanda. Maybe I can intercept them. But to be honest... if they figured out\nthe Shinkansen thing  there's nothing I can do. There it is. Alright. Sumimasen. (softly) It's leaving. It's leaving. Yes. (whispers) Let's (bleep)-ing go.\nThere it is  baby. Looks like they're\nmoving pretty fast. They're just about\nto pass through here. But it does not look\nlike on a local train. Alright  alright. I'm closing the windows. Very smooth. Oh  yeah. What is this flag? These are— I don't know. I don't know. Yeah  it is frankly a refreshing\nblend of sweet and tangy. Oh  oh. Ben  Ben  Ben. Alright.\nAlright. Wait.\nOne. And that is GG. Let's go see Sam and Scotty. Let's go see our friends. Alright  oop. They got it. Well played. Well played. Sam just texted\nback a frowny face. Yeah  he should be\nfrowny facing right now. He said \":( on Shinkansen?\" Yep.\nYep. We're both so wet right now. Well  Japan...\nthis has been incredible. Probably the most fun I've\never had playing Jet Lag. I'll say already \nI'm sure we'll be back. There they are. Hey buddy. Congrats  guys. Thank you. Ohh! There he is. Scotty Strange Parts. I don't—\nI'm so sorry. You deserve to win so much. You put in the work. Thank you. They strategized\nthat really well. They  you know—\nIt was beautiful. This was an absolute pleasure. Thank you for having me on. You were a great partner.\nThis country's amazing. The trains are great.\nThis is incredible. The game was awesome. And yeah  what a great game.\nYou guys developed a really amazing\nOh  thank you. ...game for this round \nfor this season. Yeah  this was a lot of fun. But here they are. Well done. Well played. Formidable opponents.\nGo in for a hug. I'm really sweaty.\nThat's very sweaty hug. So I don't know if you realize\nexactly how close that was. I saw you and could not\nget a photo of you. Oh my god!\n(laughs heartily) And you were\nsprinting full-speed. Yeah.\nYou did it. I finally did it. I'm so proud\nof you that you ran. Alright  gentlemen. Congratulations. The victors of\nJet Lag season six. Thank you  Sam.\nYay! Well done  guys.\nWoo! I do have something for you. Oh  what could it be? What could it be? But it was actually\nfor the first time ever  too big for me to\ncarry with me. Oh  wow.\nWow. I actually need\nto call in air support. Oh my god. What does that even mean? Just watch. Here  look behind you. Oh my god! What the hell?! What is that? It's coming down. Whooaa! It's a huge thing! You ready  one  two  three!\nIt's so heavy. (both grunting) (both cheering) Hey  Scotty. Hey  Scotty. How are you feeling? Tired. Yeah  I imagine you\nmight be feeling tired. But is there any sort of\nmore specific way you would maybe put it? Um... I think I'm feeling satisfied. This is... Okay  well  yes  well—\nAnd that's lovely  Scotty. That's great  but—\nYeah. Sort of  you know \nyou were on a plane here. And you know  maybe you\nhaven't completely adjusted. I know what\nyou want me to say  which is that I'm jet lagged. (boys shouting) He said the thing! Oh my god! See you in season seven! See you in season seven! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Thank you so much for\nwatching for this entire season all the way to the finale. This season was truly\none of my favorite  if not my favorite ever \nto make. It was so much fun. And I hope that reflects\nin the show itself and how it came out. We can't wait to bring\nyou the next season. But until then... we are keeping up with\nour podcast  for example  through the entire offseason. Making episodes every\nsingle week for y'all. Yeah  so  you know \nlike in the last offseason: We did a travel tips special. We did a whole\ngame design special where we looked back at how\nwe designed all of the games. I think that this offseason  we might do recaps\nof earlier seasons before we had the podcast. There might be  you know \nsome sneak peeks of what the next season could be. You know  there's a lot of\nfun stuff on the podcast. But also  don't miss the\nwrap-up of this season. We've got a whole episode where\nnow that the whole season's done  Ben and I can revel in our victory\nin Sam and Scotty's faces. We could also talk about\nhow we designed that final round tiebreaker. And the whole thing because—\nAnd the whole thing  yeah. It was one of the toughest\ngame design challenges I think we've had.\nIt was  yeah. So we're able to look back\non the whole season now and do this big wrap-up  which you can listen to\nexclusively on Nebula. And while you're waiting\nfor the next season to come out  there's so much other great\nstuff to watch on Nebula. I mean  at this point  we should\nfor sure plug Scotty's channel. If you aren't familiar with\nStrange Parts  definitely go check it out.\nThere is so— He does these amazing things where he goes to these\nelectronics markets in Shenzhen and he buys all these parts\nand he makes these amazing— like he modifies iPhones to do all these things\nthat iPhones can't do. I love his channel. I've watched his channel for\nyears and I was so excited. I remember wa— His very first video\nwas such a good video that I actually can remember\nwatching it five years ago. Yeah. And so it's crazy\nthat we've now done a whole season of\nJet Lag with him. It's amazing.\nYeah  it's super exciting. And he has  on Nebula  an exclusive tour of his\nworkshop  which is amazing. He takes you through\nhis whole workshop. So jealous of it. Shows you all\nof his equipment. It's an awesome way\nto spend an hour  and it will make you\nvery jealous. But that's something you\ncan only watch on Nebula. Yeah  I mean \nNebula really is like— The entire idea behind Nebula\nis you have these creators that have proven that they\nknow how to make good content  because they've built\nthese audiences on YouTube that really enjoy\nwatching what they make. And they've managed to do all\nthis on a pretty tight budget. I mean  you never have that\nbig of a budget on YouTube  and you have to command\nthe same audiences that can watch stuff with\nmillion-dollar budgets. So it makes sense that\nif you just give these creators a little bit more budget  they're able to make\nstuff that's a lot better  even than the stuff that\npeople already love on a platform like YouTube. So that's the idea\nbehind Nebula Originals  and we have so many\nof them these days. And honestly  a lot of times  it's like these creators have been\nwanting to make these projects  but they just haven't\nhad the funding for it. So it's like their\ndream passion projects. So I think that's\nwhy a lot of times  almost all the time \nthey're just excellent. Even if it's not the kind of\nthing that you wanna watch. Like I remember going\ninto the premiere for The Prince by Abigail Thorn. It's like a Shakespearean\nmultiverse kind of play. And I didn't think that\nwas gonna be my thing  but I went to the premiere 'cause I'm always\nup for a good party  and I walked away  blown away. It was so good. And I think what\nmade it better was that it was actually something\nthat I didn't maybe think I was gonna enjoy. That wasn't really the kind\nof thing for me in advance. Similar deal when I\nwent to the premiere of Night of the Coconut\nby Patrick Willems. To be honest  I hadn't really\nwatched his channel much. But went to the premiere  and it was weirdly also\na kind of multiverse thing. It was so good. I enjoyed that more\nthan so many feature films I go watch by super\nacclaimed directors  but it was so good \nand it was a Nebula Original  and you can only\nwatch it on Nebula. That's the deal with so much. So it's really the best\nways to fill your Wednesdays now that we're in the off-season \naside from the podcast  of course. The good news is it really\ndoesn't take much to get access to all of this  because when you sign\nup with our code  nebula.tv/jetlag  you'll get $20 off an\nannual subscription  which makes it come down to\ntwo and a half dollars a month. So that's like half of a latte. If it's an expensive latte. If— Well  a New York City\nlatte's definitely $5. Well  a New York City latte\nis certainly at least $5 or more. But  so it's just  don't drink\nsix New York City lattes  and you'll get a year of all\nof this  which is awesome. I think it's a great deal  and all of that helps\nsupport the creators  since we actually get a\nportion of your subscription fee when you sign up  so yeah. Click button on screen\nor in the description to sign up. And we'll see you\none week earlier than the YouTube\naudience for next season. Bye  everyone!"

        "transcript": "We're at the very top\nof New Zealand. We're racing all the way\nto the bottom. And to do it  we've turned\nthe country's entire highway system into a giant board game. But it's 8 am  so we\ngotta go  go  go  go  go! Oh my god  this is for real! Alright  come on Ben.\nWe can do this. Okay  so we have to race\nto our cars. But while we do that  we're gonna cut to a sequence\nthat explains all the rules. So here's how the game works. We're here. The first team to get here \nLookout Point at the very bottom of New Zealand  wins. There are a number of\ndifferent routes to get there  and the teams will have to choose\ntheir paths very carefully. The trouble is all of the paths\nare blocked by challenges. Lots of them. In order to clear path to the finish  teams must complete these challenges  which will unlock the\nnext stretch of highway. Once the stretch of highway is unlocked  it's unlocked for everyone  by the way  not just for the team that cleared it  which means that while it\ncan be hard to get far ahead  it's often not that hard to catch up. But teams need to be careful  because as a reward for\ncompleting a challenge  they'll earn coins which\nthey can spend on Powerups. Powerups they can use to\nsabotage their opponents. We'll explain more about Powerups\nand some other rules later on. But for now  let's get back to\na foot race between four nerds to see which team can get to their\ncar and get out of Cape Reinga first. So the road is really uphill. My weakness is running up hills. Let's try not to slow\nthem down too much. Oh  I'm very outta shape. And I'm wearing overalls. But finally...\nSam has a teammate... who's just as slow as me. Alright. This is our car for this season. His name is Dan. You can see it says so there. We gotta go... because we have to get\nto the first challenge. Okay. Let's go. I'm gonna pick Toby up over there. I think Adam's doing the same for Ben. Okay. Toby! Toby! Here! I gotta get in on\nthe other side of the car! Go  go  go  go  go! Get in the car! Let's go  go  go! Go  go  go  go  go! Oh  we've done it  Toby. Nice job. Okay  well they're breaking the law!\nThey're breaking the law! They're driving on the\nright side of the road. Alright  suckers. See if you can catch up. Okay  so right now  we are on\nthe same path to start with. Because there's\nonly one highway up here. But the first challenge\nis in about 20 minutes. We'll explain how that works in VO. Okay  this is the first challenge. The team to do it first\nwill claim its reward and clear the path for both teams. If no team is able to\ncomplete the challenge  it may be cleared by vetoing in exchange for a time\npenalty and no reward. Sandboard at the\nTe Paki Sand Dunes. One team member must\nsuccessfully sandboard down a dune of at least 50 feet\nin height without falling. Sam loves skiing. He's tried to tell me\nmany times that skiing will not give him an\nadvantage for snowboarding. Yeah  skiing's very\ndifferent than snowboarding  and this is different\nthan snowboarding. I think I should have an advantage \nbut I don't want to overstate it. This is make and break\nfor the next junction. Yeah  for sure. And yeah  we really want to\nbe at that next one first  'cause I think that\nthere's probably  I think  a clear best route. By the way  who are you? I'm Toby. I run the\nYouTube channel Tibees  make math and science videos. I did grow up in New Zealand  went to school  went\nto university here. But I haven't really\nexplored my own backyard  so this is really my\nchance to do that. Oh  I see dunes up ahead. Oh  shoot. Like over there. There they are in the distance. Do you wanna rip\noff their iconic line? Dunes  Dunes  Dunes. Dunes! Dunes! Dunes!\nDunes! Dunes! Dunes! Dunes! DUNES! DUNES!\nDunes! Dunes! Dunes! Dunes. Dunes.\nIs this a reference? I thought you were a\nmassive Jet Lag fan! You don't remember Dunes? We have to sandboard down\nDenis Villeneuve's Dune. Oh my god  here we are. Alright  we gotta\nrun once we get out. So we get to the top of\nthe first dune first. Okay  here we go. Out of the way  boys. This way. No  wait  that looks tall. No  come on. Which— which—\nNo  no  no. This way  this way. I just didn't lock the car  and they thought I\nwas manipulating them. You sure about the long grass? Let's go this way. Going to go low. Well  it's a good thing... It's a good thing that there\nare no snakes in New Zealand. Let me get across here. Oh god. These dunes are not very inviting. Oh no  he's so far ahead. Sam  get in front! We meet again  Ben. I think we're gonna be\nmeeting again many times  Toby. Oh hell no. Ah  that's wet shoes\nfor the rest of the day. This is way too\nmuch physical exercise. Yeah. A lot of uphill running. So the deal is... if they don't get it\non their first try  we have to try. We're down here\npraying that they make it. This seems very steep. Alright  here we go. Oh boy. This is slower than I expected. Go Adam! Ben says I suck. This is so much slower\nthan I expected. Go  Sam. You're gonna make it.\nYou're gonna make it. D'aah! I think I've done it. You've got it  Sam.\nYou've got it. (silly grumbling) (bleep) Well  I'm sorry that\nthat was not nearly as dramatic as\nwe expected it'd be. Turns out these don't\ngo really fast. We even waxed 'em last night. Alright.\n[indistinct] they don't catch up. They're also walking  but... Now we're off.\nYeah. So... It's probably gonna take a minute\nto get our board in the car. Out of the way  Adam. Got the board. Come on Dan! Come on Dan! If we leave before them  we get that distance\nbetween us and them. So we want to go  even though that we're\nallowed to be first. Yeah  'cause they were\ntaking their time getting the board in and stuff. Really terrible news. I've left my jacket. So I have to go get it. This is not ideal! There's our lead. Let's go!\nBye  Ben and Adam. We're never gonna see you again! Sam  this is your season. This is our season. This is  we're in it to win it. I am never in\nthe lead at the start. (panting) There it is. Alright  so we've got\na little coin store here  a little Powerup store. And 15 coins to spend.\nAnd 15 coins to spend. So let's see what we've got. Here's how the Powerups work. At any point in the game \nteams can use the store where they spend coins on\none of the five powerups. The first buys you a single Nerf Dart. Both teams have a Nerf gun  and if you can hit the other\nteam with a Nerf bullet at any point during the game  it freezes 'em for 30 minutes. Next  you've got Roadblocks. These get drawn at random\nfrom the Roadblock deck  and can be thrown down\nbehind you on your route. If your opponents encounter it  they must complete its challenge\nbefore they continue forward. The third Powerup allows you to\nturn your tracker off for 45 minutes  hiding your location\nfrom your opponents. Then you've got Curses  which get drawn from\nthe Curse deck. These can be used to\ncurse your opponents from anywhere on the map\nat any time  and will slow them down\nin some unexpected way. Finally  for 100 coins  you can skip a challenge\nwithout completing it  while still leaving it on the map for your opponents to deal with. Hey  cheeky little Nerf gun here. But that's really interesting  'cause they have no way of\ngetting a Nerf bullet right now. They have no coins. Oh no coins  sorry  yeah. So if we have a Nerf bullet  we can prevent them from doing stuff  because they're not gonna\ncome anywhere close to us. The important parts of the game are going to be these choke points  where we are forced to\nend up on the same road. So on the map  it diverges in plenty of places  but it tends to always come back\ntogether at these choke points. And those roads  since we can guarantee that\nwe'll both be driving down them  might get chockablock\nfull of Roadblocks. I'm leaning towards just\nsaving our money for now? Well  I think it depends on\nwhat they do at the intersection. (panting) (weakly) Okay... Alright  well  we're a\nlittle behind  but that's okay. So the next intersection is Awanui. Yeah  and... Basically  it's a pretty simple choice. The east route... is all about luck. There are three challenges. They're all luck based  and there's a shortcut\nthat you can take... if you get lucky on\none of the challenges. The west route is longer  but all of the challenges\nare much more reliable. I mean... frankly  my mindset... is that given that\nwe're this far behind... we just need to go\nwhichever way they didn't go. Yeah. So that we can get\nsome Powerup points. Basically  how these\ngames are designed is like  Ben  Adam and I \nwe all do the big picture design. And then when it comes to the\nmore operational work  like coming up with challenges and doing the playtesting  that's what they do\nwhile I'm off doing all those nerdy\neducational channels and stuff. And that means that they know the core strategy of the\ngame really  really well. I've known that  and\nmyself and my partner have usually done a bit\nof an underdog strategy  like a high risk \nhigh reward strategy to kind of compensate for that. But I'm realizing what that means is it's letting Ben and Adam do the strategy that they're\nmost comfortable with  which is not smart  because then they're\ngonna do it really well. We wanna force them\noff that a little bit. Yeah.\nWe wanna force them to do things that maybe they\nweren't hoping to do  or that they thought\nin their minds  planning it would be optimal. We both have  I think  the same preference\nfor which road to take. Yeah  I think we want to turn left. There's a shorter road. The one that  yeah  goes\nalong the east coast. So we will turn left at the junction  and it involves getting\nlucky in a few instances. Yeah.\nSo it's a shorter road... but if we get unlucky with\nsome of these challenges  it could end up being a lot longer. Sam likes to take risks. I bet you that they're\ngoing on the luck route. I would guess that they'd\ngo on the luck route as well. Which is okay 'cause we\nget to do the other one. We're coming up to\nour first turn off here. So we definitely\nwant to turn left  right? We're turning left. We're going on the get lucky route.\nAlright. Turning left. Okay  so let's pull up the tracker and let's see what the boys do. It looks like they're\ngoing on the luck route. Okay  okay  well\nwe're approaching it now. Do we wanna follow them? I think... You know  we could\nstay closer behind them... But I think we wanna earn\nsome Powerup points. We have none. Yeah  no  you're right. I don't wanna risk not\ngetting any Powerup coins by the time of\nthe next intersection. Yeah.\nSo I think we split up. We'll go on the safe route. Earn some points.\nYeah. And then we can\nstart messing with them. Yeah  yeah. Oh  oh.\nNo  but we can shoot 'em. I think they drove past.\nI think they drove past the junction. I think they're going right. I think that's the right move. I think they are. I think...\nYeah. Look  they're not coming. Okay.\nAlright. I think that's what\nI would do if I were them  because of the—\nbecause they know that we could have shot them and froze them for 30 minutes. Sure  yeah. So I think they want\nto do the  you know  they want to hedge their bets and do the safer routes. The first challenge\nalong this safe route is in a town called Kaitaia. Make a plentiful\nsandwich at Kaitaia. Kaitaia means \"plentiful food\". Construct a sandwich with items from four different\nstores or restaurants. At least one of the\nitems must be from a restaurant that is\nnot a fast food chain. At the Kaitaia Welcome Sign  take at least one hearty bite. I might take more\nthan one hearty bite. I'm hungry.\nYeah  I haven't eaten all day. Let's make a good sandwich. Ben  look  look. We are in Kaitaia now. The signs say Kaitaia.\nShow the signs. There's a— Well  so\nwe're gonna be passing by a PAK'nSAVE almost immediately. Okay  PAK'nSAVE is gonna be good. This is PAK'nSAVE. This is  I guess  a popular— It feels like Costco  I think. Yeah  it has Costco vibes. You wanna see something cool? I would love to see something cool. There's more sand? That rocks. That's\ngonna keep happening for the rest of the game. Sandwich ingredient number one. Bread. This seems fine. Whew. Vogel's original mixed grain bread. I hope that that's\na New Zealand brand. If it's not  I'm sorry. It's called toast. Is that what they call bread? Maybe.\nThat doesn't make any sense. Alright  we're a few minutes\nfrom Coopers Beach now. This is where we're going\nto have to dig a hole. The depth is yet to be decided. Dig a lucky hole at Coopers Beach. Roll a die. Multiply that number by six. Dig a hole of that depth\nin inches at Coopers Beach. So  I mean  this definitely is make or break on the roll.\nSo we gotta get lucky. If we get a six or a five  that's gonna\ntake a minute I think. Oh  no! Sam  that's not a one.\nI know! Oh  damn  okay. Oh  no. Oh  look at that. That is... Ugh... That is a lot. Ohh.\nOh  that's a lot. Alright  let's find a good spot. That was brutal. Literally the worst possible option.\nAy yi yi. Oh  here's a good stick. I'm liking the\nmoistness of the soil. The footprints are sinking right in. Do you have any\nideas for approach  Toby? (sigh) Just keep digging. Okay  this is some kind of\ngrocery something. Okay. This says it's tasty. Alright. There's something that a\nlot of people don't know  Ben. In New Zealand  they drive\non the left side of the road. So... that is something I'm focused on. I just sort of keep\nrepeating to myself  left side of the road. That's some fun New Zealand trivia. What's fun about that trivia is that if you forget that fun fact... You'll die. We'll be dead. Catching some pipis in\nthe sand while we're at it. What are those? Little shells. It's already 16. Wow  okay. The problem is it's\ncollapsing in on itself. And we got some water in there. You know what?\nWe've got some avalanches. That's dirt. I'm hitting dirt. We're not gonna be\nable to go deeper. You have hit solid or... Yeah. You feel that? Yeah  yeah. It was\neither a large stone or... Yeah  I think we need a dryer spot. Ay yi yi. Ah  man  okay. Fill it in so\nthat no one gets hurt. Okay  let's go\nmaybe over there. Alright  we gotta\npick up the pace! Alright. Time to get our last ingredient. We do have to get\nsomething from a restaurant. Probably don't wanna\ndo more cheese. No. Oh  there's cured meats. Here we go. Thank you. What do you think?\nOver here? Here? I don't know if there—\nthis is gonna be hard. It's a lot drier  but at least it probably\nwon't fill with water here. And hopefully it'll be deeper. Let's get digging again. Ah  there's shells. There's so many shells. It's just turning into\npure shell. I'm wondering if\nwe should bore it. This is getting so shelly so fast. Yeah  that's only like 14 inches. Ah  that six has\nreally done us dirty. Brutal. Damn. Maybe let's go walk that way.\nSee if there's a better spot. This is just gonna take forever here. Third time lucky. (sputters) Maybe. Alright  we're making\nreally good progress  really good time.\nThe last thing needs to be from a non-fast food restaurant. Non-fast food restaurant. So far  things aren't\nlooking good. There's a— This place just\nsays \"Chinese food\" up there. Yeah  it's gonna\ntake too long  man. That place just says\n\"Cappuccino\". Could we go\ninside of Cappuccino? Turkish restaurant is open. Oh baby. Yeah  there'll be\nsomething fast there. Yeah  yeah  yeah.\nThis is perfect. Just a side of\nfalafel would be great. Thank you very much.\nI appreciate you. Okay  amazing time on that one. Great work \ngreat work  great work. Like here  maybe? I can feel like that's\ngotta be deep enough. Yeah  yeah.\nWe're balancing two variables: sogginess and the water coming in.\nOh  that's kind of good technique. Versus being too close\nto land and hitting land. Oh  that is getting pretty close. It's promising so far.\nThis is not too bad. Yeah  I think as long as we\ndon't hit the bottom again. There we go. See  Kaitaia has a\nfamous welcome sign that's in three languages. So we start with... Vogel's original mixed grain toast. We're gonna go with\none slice of that. And then Ben \nwhy don't you put on some... I believe it's pepperoni salami  which I think you can\njust call pepperoni  but that's fine. And now I think the falafel. And then I think we're\njust gonna sort of... Smash that. Cheese. And now that's... We've invented a new sandwich. This is a falafel \npepperoni and cheddar. What is it? Cheddar.\nCheddar. Aged cheddar cheese sandwich. And I'm gonna take a hearty bite. Call it the Kaitaia Special. Is it good? Mhm. Progress update. We have a sinkhole. Sam  we... We in the pits here. Oh  the water is coming! Status update. Status update. I hope the sandwich— I hope that all the sandwich\nshops are closed or something. I hope their\nsandwich tastes like sand. That's a good sandwich. I mean  it basically\njust tastes like falafel. It does. Which is delicious. This sandwich is\nlegitimately good. The sunk cost fallacy. Have you already dug\ntoo deep to turn around? Or should you always\njust keep digging? Let me see if\nwe've gotten any deeper. I think we've gotten shallower! We're not breaking progress. Are we smart enough\nto realize that? No. We gotta get a move on  buddy. Okay. We're on a race. That's legitimately good. Everyone try this at home. ♪ Making pretty good time here... ♪ All I'm saying. Making pretty good time. We're gonna check their\nprogress in a minute. See how they're doing. We are digging\ncloser to depression with every scoop. I hate to say it  but what's\nthe veto period on this one? Let me go check. 60 minutes. Ugh! We need a different solution. Madness is doing the\nsame thing over again and expecting a different result. I know. I mean... should we check if\nthere's a better spot? We can check right here. In a linear system  that's too wet. This will be drier. Where is the point\nwhere it gets too solid? I guess  yes. If we go halfway in here  that's kind of a\nsystematic way to test. Yeah  that's true. Why don't I dig\nnext to you up here? Then we can get a little\nbit more of a test. Are they done\nat Coopers Beach yet? Nope. They're still there?! They're at Coopers Beach. Man  they must have\ngotten really unlucky. And I don't know\nwhat Sam is thinking  because he is consistently unlucky in these games.\nThat's true. He has terrible  terrible luck. Still  it's all collapsing\nin down there. Can I just have a look? Yeah  it's filling up. It's just filling up\nwith water and sand. Because not only is it not\nkeeping the structural integrity  I'm still hitting the ground. What do you think of vetoing it? I mean... can you think of anything else? I don't think so. I mean  the thing about a veto\nis the veto period starts now. Yeah. So if we want a veto \nit's like sunk cost fallacy. We can't wait. I just don't— I mean— I really  really  really\nwould hate to veto. They're still there?! Yeah. At this point \nit seems like... either they're almost done  or they probably had to veto it. Not doing good. Not doing good. Off to a good start  but... Man  they're really gonna\nneed to get that shortcut. I'm thinking that this is\njust fundamentally impossible. Let's just veto\nit then and move on. I think yeah  I agree. I really hate... I'm gonna be so depressed. I think it's the smart\nthing to do at this point. Just do it  just do it. So it's 11:05. We're gonna have to\nwait until 12:05. That is brutal. Sucks for them! #SucksToBeThem! So that's the thing\nabout the luck route. Sometimes your luck\nain't so good. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Welcome to\nseason five  everyone! We are so excited to be back. This season is gonna\nbe quite something. Like there are actually\ngenuinely multiple moments that I am actively worried about how hard it's gonna\nbe to be able to convince y'all that\nthey're not staged. It's a really dramatic season. I think it's gonna be really good. And I can't wait for\ny'all to see the rest. And as y'all probably know \nthe show is basically paid for almost entirely by our\nNebula subscribers. So this season  we are\ngiving them more than ever. They can all watch\nepisode two right now. If you're a Nebula subscriber\nwatching here for some reason  go watch episode two\nright now on Nebula. It's already up. You know  that's because we\nrelease every single episode a week early on Nebula\nfor the entire show forever. This season  we're\ndoing something extra. This season  we are  every Wednesday night after\nreleasing an episode on Nebula  Ben  Adam  Toby  and myself \nwe are recording a podcast. It's called The Layover. And basically we're gonna be\ntalking through our strategies  talking about what\nhappened behind the scenes  answering viewer questions. It's great  we've already\nrecorded the first one. In fact  it's already up\nfor the first episode  because Nebula subscribers watched\nthe first episode last week  and we're gonna be doing it\nfor every single episode  and even through the off season. So  and that's Nebula exclusive. You have to be a Nebula\nsubscriber to listen to that  because it's  you know \nit's an appreciation to the fact that  again  they're paying for all\nof this pretty much. But these subscribers are actually\ngetting even more than this  because there's like more than\na hundred other top quality creators also on Nebula  who are releasing all their\nvideos early and ad-free as well. And then on top of that  there's all sorts of big\nbudget Nebula originals by all these creators. And they're really good  and they're always coming out. For example  like\njust a few weeks ago  I went to the premiere of The Prince by Abigail Thorn. I already had high\nexpectations going in  but it beat my high expectations. It was genuinely really\nentertaining to watch. So I definitely recommend it. And what makes Nebula\neven better is that if you sign up at our link \nnebula.tv/jetlag  not only will you get $20\noff an annual subscription  but a portion of your\nsubscription fee will go to us  directly to us  for as\nlong as you say subscribed. Which you know  not only gives us\nlike monthly recurring revenue  which is  you know  a much more\nstable way for us to operate  but it also allows us\nto use that revenue to be able to invest\nin future seasons and make them bigger and better\nand more frequently and all that. So  you know \nyou get stuff  we get stuff. It's a great deal for everyone. So click the button on screen or head to nebula.tv/jetlag to sign up and watch\nthe next episode now  listen to podcasts  watch all\nthe originals  get everything. It's a great deal.\nIt's the best Jet Lag experience  and it helps support us. So thanks in advance.\nSee you next week."

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nback to episode two of our race across New Zealand. We're racing from here to here \nand along the way  we've turned the\ncountry's highway system into one giant board game. There are many different\npaths to the bottom  but each one is blocked\nby different challenges. Each challenge rewards a\ncertain amount of coins  which can be spent to\nsabotage the other team. Right now  the teams have split up. After starting behind  Ben and Adam just took the lead on the more reliable western route  because Toby and I took our chances on the luck-based eastern route  and had to veto our last challenge. That means we can't\nmake any progress for the next 60 minutes. (nervous giggle) We'll be fine. Maybe. I believe—\nI know theoretically that we have so much game in front of us \nand they can have bad luck too. And  over the length of the game \nshould have bad luck too. I just hate it \n'cause it seems like... It's always behind. We have a lot of\nsnacks in this car. We bought all\nNew Zealand snacks. So we're gonna do\na little snack review. This is a show\nwithin a show called \"Snack Boyz\" with a Z. We might work on that. Our first snack is Rashuns  with this fun penguin on it. Oh  these smell bad. What's their flavor\nprofile supposedly? \"Cheesy bacon attack.\" Oh  I hate that. That is certainly a\ncheesy bacon attack. Yeah  I do feel attacked. We have arrived in Ōkaihau. Alright  so... Tunnel's just up there. There it is. Sing The Ōkaihau Express\nin the Ōkaihau Rail Tunnel. Ōkaihau used to be the northernmost\nrail terminus in New Zealand. Both team members must\nmemorize and sing \"The Ōkaihau Express\"\nuninterrupted while standing in the\nŌkaihau rail tunnel. If you make any mistakes \nyou must start from the beginning. You may not begin\nmemorizing until you arrive. This is a cool shot. It's like in a music video  which this kind of is. Sick.\nOkay  so: It starts out in Otiria  the smallest train— Starts out from Otiria.\nFrom  okay. 'Cause we have to\nget every word right. Yeah. We cannot get\na single word wrong. An engine and a guardsvan. What is that?\nI don't know. Oh  here we go  finally.\nHere we go  we're off. Okay. What's the song? ♪ Back on the road again ♪ (hums) You know that song? With our veto period up  Toby and I are headed\nto our next challenge. Win the lottery in Kaeo. Roll a die. Buy that number of instant\nKiwi scratchie tickets. If you win any amount of money\non any of your scratch-offs  you complete the challenge\nand unlock the shortcut. If you fail  you cannot\nretry this challenge  and you'll be forced to\ngo around the long way. I've done some studying\nof the scratch-it tickets that may be available to us.\nOkay. Because the odds of each\nof them are published online. Oh  and they're different odds. And I've found the three\nbest rated odds for scratchies. Alright  we're getting close. Welcome to Kae– Kaeo—? Kaeo  I think. We're going to Four Square \nwhich is right there. Nice  okay. We don't have the dice. Dammit.\nSorry  I don't have the dice. Oh  no! We got so excited. Alright.\nAlright  you give a good roll. Okay  that's good. Nice job.\nFive  that's five. That's pretty good.\nGood roll. If we don't make it\nwith five of them  we are actively unlucky. One of those the right ones?\nGet Outdoors. Yep  that's one. Should we just\nget three of those? We need— and this\none here  the lemons. Three and two. Thank you very much.\nThank you. Alright  we\njust need to win any. Nothing yet. Oh. It has a bridge.

Yeah  look at that.\nBeach chair  beach chair. Oh my god.\nRight? Beach chair  beach chair \nten dollars. Is that right?\nYeah. Match any winning\nsimilar to any other. We've done it. Take it  take it. Go get your $10.\nGo get your $10. No  we don't have time.\nWe'll do it later. Let's go! Nice job. That's great. We didn't even need the five. But our six million\nis on the five  and I'm keeping the— Well  whoa  whoa  whoa. No  no  we're splitting. We're lucky.

No. So the next\nintersection after the falls is actually pretty\nclose after the falls. So I think we wanna\nstart kind of discussing what the plan is  right? What's the plan  Toby? Should we find out where\nBen and Adam are now? Oh  yes  let's have a look. Because it could be very much\ndecided by which route they go on. And they're probably\nin front of us by now. Yes  I wonder if they've\nalready done that junction. They haven't got to\nthe junction yet. They are just before the junction. That is good. They are still in Ōkaihau. Yeah  we're not as—\nI think they're at the tunnel. I think they're actually at the\ntunnel singing the song right now. Well  hopefully they're having\na really hard time memorizing. Oh  it's a (bleep) nightmare. Okay  here  let's\njust give it a go.

Alright  here we go. Unfortunately  we don't\nhave time for a full analysis of all the best things here \nbecause maps are not working. Reception's not working  but... We're gonna have to... We're in a rush. Because we were\nin such a rush then  we'll explain now. The next decision\npoint is a big one. There are two routes. The eastern route is shorter  an estimated 122 minutes  compared to the western\nroute's 192 minutes. But making up for the\nlonger driving time is the fact that the western route only has three relatively\nsafe challenges  like visiting a tree. While the eastern route\nhas five challenges  several of which are\ntime consuming or risky. Most notably: the cream\ntrip at the Bay of Islands  where teams will have to find a way\nto travel between three islands. So once again  the decision comes down to how\nmuch risk teams want to take on. I think I would lean\ntowards the western route  'cause it seems lower risk. For what it's worth  I suspect Ben and Adam are\ngonna take the eastern route. Just because every\ntime I talk to them... Yeah.\nLeading up to this trip  they tell me how excited they\nare to go to the Bay of Islands  which is on the eastern route. We are going... to the Bay of Islands. Going to the Bay of Islands. I think it's gonna be\nvery beautiful there. Yeah.\nI hope. I mean  it supposedly has the second bluest\nsky in the world. Yeah  that's sick. I don't really\nknow what that means  but it sounds cool. It does sound really cool. The east route is so cool. I'm really excited for some\nof the stuff we're gonna do. It'll be interesting\nto see whether Sam and Toby Whether they follow behind us.\ndecide to follow behind. If I were them  I\nwould follow behind us. We've figured\nout that Ben and Adam are going east towards\nthe Bay of Islands. Okay. Personally  I think it's unlikely\nthat we get to the Bay of Islands and complete that\nchallenge before them  especially given that they might drop some roadblocks and stuff.\nYeah. The thing about the west route is those challenges are\nvery predictable  I think  and they're very straightforward. I've got a little bit of trauma\nfrom the sand on the beach  and I'm just wanting\nto do challenges that I know 100 percent we can achieve.\nYep. Yep. I don't wanna\nget to the kayak shop  they're not open. Or all the kayaks are sold out.\nThey're not available. Yeah  it's too windy \nit's too choppy. I don't wanna know about it. I wanna go to a tree that's\nbeen there for 500 years  and is still gonna be\nthere when we arrive. Yes  agreed. Let's lock it in. Alright.\nWest route! So it seems like they've taken\nthe other way  the west route. Really? Yeah. Huh. So they're not\nfollowing behind us  which is bold. I mean... Okay  okay. I think there's a really\ngood chance we're gonna beat 'em to Auckland now. Okay  we are about 15 minutes\nfrom the Bay of Islands  where the next challenge is. Complete a cream trip\nat the Bay of Islands. \"Cream trip\" is the term for the\ntraditional transport of goods between islands at\nthe Bay of Islands. For this challenge  you have to transport\nany kind of cream between any three islands. Both team members must\neat some of the cream while on each of the islands. So  yeah  we can\nhopefully just hop in a kayak  get some cream  bring it to the islands  knock it out. Easy peasy.\nYeah. I mean  I don't know if\nit's gonna be easy peasy. Well  okay  but\nyou know  it'll be fun. It'll be fun.\nIt'll be fun. Funny peasy.\nFun peasy. That doesn't quite have\nthe same ring to it. It's gonna be fun peasy. Boom. (squirt) Does work. What do you normally\ndo on road trips? Normally what I do on road trips is listen to the entire unabridged\ndiscography of Lizzo. I was telling Sam yesterday I exclusively listen to\nEminem bardcore myself. Yeah. It took some explaining\nwhat that was  but... Just medieval remixes. Medieval remixes of\npop songs I guess is the gist  right? Yeah  that's\nmy favorite genre. Okay. So we have\nbeen assuming kayaks  but we just saw some\nmotorboats down by the wharf. We're gonna ask if\nwe're allowed to rent. Hey there  do you\ndo jet ski rentals? Yes  sir. [indistinct] We go on a tour. Oh  on a tour?\nYeah. Oh  okay  no thanks then. Alright  it's kayaks  buddy  sorry. Do you wanna play 20 questions? I don't know how\nto play 20 questions. You just have\nto ask questions as— I'm gonna think of a person. You have to ask questions \nyes or no questions  and you get 20 to figure\nout who the person is. Okay. Are they a New Zealander? No. No  that'd have been too niche. Are they female? No. Are they a singer? No. Are they a sports star? In a way. It probably depends who you ask  whether or not it's a sport. Okay  so there's\nan island there. There's an island there.\nThere's an island there. We need to get to all of them  and eat cream on them  I guess. Kayak's up there. I think we're gonna be fine. Yeah  so we want a double 45. Somebody in here? There's no one in here. I don't love that. Is there another kayak rental spot? That place. Is their sport a... card-based game? Yes. Is it... one— is it... one of the people\ncurrently playing Jet Lag? Yes.\n(giggles) So my final guess at\nquestion number 20 is... is it Adam Chase? No! Oh no! It was Ben! Devastating. Well  there's no one here. So... Seemingly someone\nwas here earlier. I mean  they left\ntheir glasses here. That guy's dragging kayaks. Oh  is that our guy? That looks like it might be our guy. Do you have kayaks? No. No? Yep  I do. Take the blue on the\nleft hand side there. Right  thank you. No problem. Alright. We're gonna stop\nrecording for a minute so that Ben can help me paddle. Yay. So we'll see you\ncloser to the first island. This one. Okay  bye. I can announce\nthat not only are Ben and Adam in Paihia\ndoing the cream trip  but their tracker is\nno longer on the land. Oh no! They are  in fact \nin the ocean on their way to the first or the second or the\nthird of their islands. Whether they're in a kayak\nor a jet ski  I'm not sure. A jet ski  that\nwould be quite something. That would make it easier. So I just realized\nthat we could have asked the guy with the jet ski tour if he could\ntake us to the island. He probably would've\ntaken us to the island. I think he probably would've. So we're doing it in\nthe good old fashioned way. We've arrived to the first island. Come here and\nlet me feed you cream. Be careful of your little feet. These little guys  I hate them. (squirt) Bwuh. (squirt) Yay. Yeah  that's not great. Alright  we are on route... To island number two. To island two. Okay.\nIt's that little one. Okay. I'm gonna be honest  Ben.\nBefore  when I was like  we can definitely do this in\n30 minutes  maybe even 20  I think I was wrong about that. It seemed bold. It is harder\nthan I'd like it to be. It's getting pretty forested. Weaving through the forest  off to find\nwhat I believe to be the largest known kauri\ntree in New Zealand. Admire Tāne Mahuta. Tāne Mahuta is the world's\nlargest known living kauri tree  estimated to be between\n1 250 to 2 500 years old. You must admire it for\nat least five minutes. So it's gonna\nbe a real big tree. I'm looking forward to seeing it. Yeah  we gotta do our best\nto not be obnoxious YouTubers  because this tree is considered\nsacred in Māori tradition. So that's why the challenge is really just go look at\nit and appreciate it  rather than  I don't know... Carve your name into it. That would be bad.\nReally bad. It's very pretty. It's very different from what\nwe have been driving through. I made Ben get the camera  'cause I have an awesome\nbit that I'm gonna do. You ready for it?\nI'm so excited. Bay of Islands... more like Bay of Water! Most of this is freaking water. That's so true. That's not even a joke. That's so true.\nIf it was the Bay of Islands  I feel like this\nwould be a lot easier. Oh (bleep) Okay. There's the island. We're getting closer. Oh! Alright  we gotta be quick while also not distressing\nall of the tourists. We have to go clean our shoes. They have the kauri\ndieback disease here  so they've got these stations for us to clean our shoes before going in  so we don't spread disease. Biosecurity is rad.\nThese are some healthy trees. Oh wait  that's it. Our five minutes starts now. Kind of amazing. Ohh. You excited to\neat some whipped cream? Oh  it's no. (squirt) Okay.\nRight. That's island number two. We are off to\nisland number three. Look at that cool bird.\nLook at that cool bird. It's got a big... Oh my god  that is a cool bird. Round beak. You're so good at\nspotting cool birds  Ben. Thank you. I love— I actually mean that \nyou genuinely are good at it. I love a cool bird. You're almost always\npointing out a cool bird. It looks like the Avatar tree. You know the tree\nfrom Avatar? Yeah  yeah  I do. Must be based on it.\nI wouldn't be surprised. Is that a penguin? No. We're almost at island three. Alright  Ben.\nAlright. I really gotta say  I really don't\nwant more whipped cream right now. Yeah  I know.\nI'll give you just a little bit. (squirt) Okay. (squirt) We've done it.\nWe've eaten cream. Challenge complete.\nMake the thingy pop up. Ohh. Okay.\nOhh. Now we have to get back there. I'm very tired  very full of... Full of cream.\nCream  and my back hurts. Yeah. We're channeling some powers. We're channeling\ngood  good vibes. We're channeling some good\nvibes for the rest of our journey. Yeah. Any last hot takes? I don't wanna make a hot take. I just wanna admire it. Alright. That's a hot take in and of itself. Oh  okay  Tāne Mahuta. Unfortunately...\nIt's time to go. Unfortunately  we must depart. Yep. That was  I'm glad we added the\ntime to admire in the rules. 'Cause that would've sucked to just\ncome up and look at it and wait. Yeah  almost as if we went\nall the way to Rainbow Falls and then left in the\ncar park with a... Rainbow Falls\nisn't the life giver. This is. New driver alert! And we're off. Sam and Toby are moving. So we gotta move. How long have\nwe been doing this? I have no idea. ♪ The ship we sail is a kayak ♪ ♪ It's a kayak that we rented here ♪ ♪ We love to sell our big kayak ♪ We're back! We're back. We've made it back to land. Ah! Oh Jesus.\nAlright. Christ. And stop. Alright  well  I'd say\nthat took slightly longer than I would've hoped. Let's go. Okay  so I'm just gonna\nlook at where Ben and Adam are. Yeah  they've left\nPaihia  but only barely. They've like just left. Oh  so they\nfinished the cream trip? They've finished\nthe cream trip  yeah. Okay  but it still took them\na decent time  I think. Yeah  in terms of geography  we've moved down the country. Yeah  we're a good bit\nsouth of them now  yeah. We're off now... To the \"Hunterwassen\"\nPublic Toilets. Use the Hundertwasser\nPublic Toilets. Not a lot more to explain. Okay  welcome back to... Snack Boyz! Oh  Snack Boyz. Do we want a new name? I don't know.\nSnackin'. No  I think we need\nto have the same name. With Ben and Adam. Well  'cause I'm gonna\nget the motion graphics team to make a special little... like logo and stuff for this. So I think we have to decide on one. The Ben and Adam Snacktacular. Welcome back to... The Snack Zone. Ooh  The Snack Zone. That's good. Today  we're gonna\nbe reviewing... Bluebird Thinly Cut potato chips. Adam  would you do the honors\nof trying a potato chip? I'll tell you what  that\ntastes like a potato chip for sure. Okay  we gotta hurry. We're running behind. And there they are. They got a weird  cool design. We just thought it would\nbe fun to put them on there. Why? I don't  you know. Yeah  I mean \nquit yelling at us. We're just trying to have fun. Here are the toilets. They look really weird. Alright  we gotta use 'em  Ben. Now the camera goes off. Ben  have you finished your use of\nthe \"Hunter Watson\" Public Toilets? (distant) Yes. Oh! You're out here  let's go. And now... we are headed to... Adrenalin Adventure Park. Oof. We're barely gonna make it in time. 2.8 miles— kilometers\nto the turnoff. Okay. So... let me check the... Well  let me wait until we turn  and then I'll check the\nrules for the challenge. Make a new friend at Kai Iwi Lakes. Snorkel in the waters of either\nLake Kai Iwi or Lake Tahoroa until you find a clearly visible \nliving  non-human animal. Tell it your name. You must get it on camera. ♪ We have made it ♪ Let's hope that they\nhave bountiful... things. Animals  non-human animals. Many friends for us.\nYes. Okay. Man  this is a gorgeous lake. I don't know. Yeah  this is gonna be tough to find\nfish with all these people around. Oh.\nThere is a cow in the way. You know  he's\njust hanging out. Oh.\nThere you go. There you go. Welcome to Lake Edwin \nhome of Adrenalin Adventure Park. Go extreme at\nAdrenalin Adventure Park. Both team members must complete ten separate obstacles at\nAdrenalin Adventure Park. Hi there. Can we still wrap\naround for 10 or 15 minutes? Yeah  sure. Great. This is actually \nlet's stick this out. Alright  here we go. I really can't emphasize enough that this is just on a farm. How you doing?\nIt's refreshing. It's lovely. Okay. You take the lead. I'm gonna\nfollow behind you  okay? Wow  truly barely completed it. Oh  Ben! Toby Cam is on. Just keep rolling  I guess. Alright. Best of luck. I'll see what I can do. Okay  come on  come on. Here we go  come on. Up  up  up! Here we go. I've completed it. You got it  buddy! Just hold on to something. Just making a game plan. I think the game plan\nis just run straight down it. How many have we completed? One. (distant shrieking) Shut up. Just go fast. Go fast. Key is speed. Just run across it. Is that— You got\nto the other end of it. Is that complete?\nI clearly completed that. Okay. You got the other end. I'm saying that's complete. This is another one.\nThis is easier. So you just do this one. (wheezing) Just go fast  that's the key. Just go fast. Quick  quick  quick  quick  quick. Take a minute for setting yourself. Quality  quality. Great job  great job. Nailed it. Nailed it.\nLook at that. Okay. Just spotted Toby running away. Hopefully that's good news. We've done it? I saw the\nworld's tiniest fish  and I hope it's on the GoPro. Is there any way to check? We can check. Okay. Okay.\nAnd you introduced yourself? Introduced myself.\nI said my name. He said his name. Everyone introduced themselves. I couldn't see nothing! The visibility was so poor that as soon as\nI got in the water  I knew that I wouldn't\nbe able to see a fish  even if there was\none right underneath. Well  as long as you saw it. Great  okay. So that's\nfive we've both done. Alright  you got it. So just run and grab\nonto the big pillar. You gotta kinda stretch\nyour way around it. I'm too small\nfor the big pillar. Gotta try the other big pillar. I think they're the same. But  I like the\nfeel of this one more. Okay  okay. Other pillar was a winner  great. You're doing so good.\nYou're doing so good. And I'm proud of you. I'm gonna go over. Oh  I think\nthat's a huge risk. Okay  over worked  great. Alright  ready to head? Did you make any\nfriends on or off water? Absolutely not. We should just write\na big decal on our thing. On our cars. \"Get outta the way.\nWe're in a race.\" Jet Lag  yeah. This is for content! We gotta be\nmaking the content. Gotta understand\nthe sanctity of content! So this will be nine. (bleep) hate it here. I know  I know.\nYou're doing so good. That's nine. No  no  no! (wheezing giggles) Just get up.\nJust walk onto this thing. I'm so weak. Okay. Don't fall in. Okay  you did it  okay. Somehow they still seem\nto be at the Adrenalin Park. They think it would take\n20 minutes  that challenge. Well  I wonder if\nthey had to veto it. 'Cause that's the\nonly explanation for why they would still be there \nI can think of. Part of me just wants them\nto had to veto something. This is looking.... Coming up buildouts.\npromising. Yeah. Great job. Any concluding thoughts? We haven't\neaten any food today. We can't be climbing\nthat thing  right? So seemingly \nwe are climbing that thing. Give your partner a genuine\ncompliment at Tokatoka Peak. In Māori stories  Tokatoka Peak is\nto be summited with a loved one. In the spirits of platonic love  when you arrive at\nthe top of the peak  give your teammate a genuinely\nthoughtful compliment. Alright  gotta clean up again. Alright  let's get to it. That seemed like it was one of\nthe worst experiences of your life. I threw up a lot of lake water. I swallowed a lot of lake water. Yeah  I don't understand\nhow you swallowed— I just  my mouth was open  and then I went in the lake  and I just took in\na lot of lake water. But now it's gone. It's getting steep. It's definitely a steep one. So sweaty. So sweaty and sandy\nand et cetera. I see the light. Like we're nearly there. You see the light.\nYep. I see the light too. Nearly there. Where am I? This is gorgeous. Okay  well  we're still in a race  so we need genuine compliments. Sam  you are very patient. You've been patient with\nme climbing up this hill. Oh  thank you. And on our kerfuffle\non the navigation. I appreciate it. And for that  thank you. No problem. Also  I have a gift for you. You have a gift for me? I found this on the way up. It's a berry.\nOh my gosh. Should I eat it?\nIt may not be poisonous  but that's up for you to decide. That's one. I would like to compliment\nyour YouTube prowess. Because I'm someone... Don't let Toby hear this. I hate math. Math is like my\nleast favorite thing. You didn't hear that  right? Nothing. Yeah. Despite what I just mentioned  Toby's channel is\nso entertaining. And to take something\nthat you really don't like and make it genuinely\nfun and entertaining and interesting to watch  that takes real skill. Thank you  Sam.\nYou're welcome  Toby. That's so nice of you. Should we get back to it? Yeah  fist bump.\nFist bump. We're... way behind now. Yeah. So we thought that they\nhadn't done the hike yet  but they have done the hike. And we still have two\nmore challenges to do before we can get to the\nnext intersection point. Yeah. Hopefully quick ones  but... challenges nonetheless. So I'd say that\nthings aren't going great. No.\nBut... our next challenge is very fast. So we just need\nto do it really quickly. And then the challenge after that  hopefully quickly as well. And we just need to gain\nas much ground as we can. Somewhat soon  we should\nstart thinking about what happens when the roads converge again. And that's gonna be a\nreally crucial point. Because if\nwe're ahead of them  even by ten feet  we can start dropping\nsome powerups and stuff. Some roadblocks and stuff  which I think\nwould really help us. And really hurt them \nwhich is that's our goal  to hurt Ben and Adam. Now we are headed\nto Clapham's Clock Museum. Find the time at Clapham's\nNational Clock Museum. At the museum  find a clock that is showing the\ncorrect time to within 15 minutes. The clock must be on display— it may not be your own clock. This should be\nreally  really fast. Should be a breeze. This should take maybe\nlike 5 or 10 minutes  I think. And we also need it\nto take 5 or 10 minutes. 'Cause we are behind now. Alright.\nOkay. Let's look at those clocks. Clapham's National Clock Museum. No... No  no  no  no  no  no \nno  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no. Okay... Oh god  that is not good. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Ohh boy! That is not looking good  boys. But we're gonna have to wait\na whole week to find out. Unless  of course \nyou're a Nebula subscriber. Because every single episode\nis up one week early on Nebula  meaning episode three\nof Jet Lag... up right now on Nebula. And that episode \nI really think... I mean  that's where it starts\nto really heat up this season. It gets dramatic. But of course  you know \nforgetting about that for now  episode two  I'm sure you\nhave plenty of questions. So much happened.\nAnd we have a brand new way that we're really excited about\nanswering all of your questions and explaining\neverything that happened. It's our new podcast\ncalled The Layover. But just for\nlisteners of the podcast  we right now are going to play a punk rock cover of\n\"The Ōkaihau Express\" that we got made for something\nthat we can't tell you about yet. Does Ben drive? No  I don't drive\nit all this season. I technically have\na driver's license  but we would have to go\nback to when I was 15. Oh wow.\nGo back  go back  go ahead. I was in love\nwith my best friend. I remember after Ben\nkept talking about how much lake water he swallowed \nwhich I really didn't understand  'cause I'm like  swallowing\nis a voluntary action. I just have an easier time swallowing lake water\nthan most folks. He's got one of\nthose lake water mouths. Yeah. And that's what\nmakes Ben special. Yeah  I must have been a bit\nout of it when I got to the top  'cause I was watching the episode  and I had no memory at all of basically what\nwe said at the top  or me giving you the berry. Oh  easy answer.\n\"Truth Hurts\" by Lizzo. ♪ Why men great\n'til they gotta be great ♪ Sing more  keep going! ♪ I just took a DNA test ♪ ♪ Turns out I am a hundred\npercent that bitch ♪ ♪ Even when I'm crying crazy ♪ ♪ Yeah I got boy problems ♪\nKeep going  yeah! ♪ That's the human in me ♪ ♪ Bling bling  then I got 'em \nthat's the goddess in me ♪ A'ight  that's enough. Wow  we got so much more\nthan I thought we were gonna get. That's why you pay for Nebula. So every week\nwhen we're in season  we get on a call with Toby  and we talk through everything\nthat happened in the episode. Basically after we\nfinish filming a season  we don't know what\nthe other team did. And so we always get together  and we have a\nreally fun discussion where we find out everything\nthe other team did and we ask\neach other questions and we learn about their strategy. And we were like  what if instead\nof doing that on our own time  we recorded it and\nwe made it a podcast? And that's basically\nwhat The Layover is. But we also spend a lot of\ntime answering your questions. We've found that every episode  we get a ton of questions on\nReddit and Discord and Twitter. And we figured  why don't\nwe put all of the answers to those questions in one place? And that's what The Layover is  and we think that\nyou'll really enjoy it. And it's exclusive on Nebula. So we made the\npodcast in appreciation for our Nebula subscribers. Nebula  for those of\nyou who don't know  is the largest creator-founded \ncreator-owned streaming site. Co-founded by Sam here. And it's great. It's chockablock\nwith plenty of great original  exclusive content from— That's so true. It's chockablock.\nIt is chockablock with great exclusive\ncontent from people like past contestants \nBrian and Joseph. And us. We've made stuff\nfor other channels too. That's true. We have\na ton of exclusive stuff. And there's always new\nstuff coming out on Nebula. So you have all this exclusive\nstuff from other creators. You get every single episode\nof Jet Lag one week early. You get every single exclusive\nepisode of The Layover reacting with these. You get all of these creators'\nnormal videos early and ad-free.

        "transcript": "Welcome back to episode three\nof our race across New Zealand. Last episode \nmy partner Toby and I went from being about\n50 minutes behind to around 30 minutes ahead  largely thanks to our decision\nto take the longer western route. Despite its 192 minute driving time — 70 minutes longer than\nthe eastern route – its three relatively\nsimple challenges didn't slow us down too much  while Ben and Adam\non the eastern route spent over two hours completing their first three challenges \nwith two still left to go. Being behind is\nespecially bad right now  because we're approaching Auckland  the largest city in New Zealand \nwhich all paths go through. The team to complete\nthe Auckland challenge will earn a huge reward and have their pick of the\nmany paths headed south. All of which is to say  Ben and Adam are\ndesperate to catch up by blazing through their\nremaining challenges. The first of which is\nattempting to find a clock at Claphams Clock Museum that's telling the right\ntime within 15 minutes. The only problem is... the museum's closed. Oh god  that is not good. That is not good. (bleep) ♪ Back on the road again ♪ I need to learn the\nrest of that song. That's the only lyric I know. Toby  I have some delightful news. Mhm? I did the math. I know that's your\nthing  but I did it. It is currently the closure time\nof the Clapham Clock Museum. So it seems like they're\ngonna have to veto. Can we— we can\nsee clocks through... Okay. ...this glass. Alright  okay.\nYeah  yeah  yeah. Okay  we'll— yeah  yeah. Look through here. No  no  no. Oh  wait  wait.\nBen  Ben  Ben. What time is it? That one says 5:56. It's 6:11. That's within 15 minutes! That's exactly within\n15 minutes  look! Which one?\nShow it  show it. The grandfather clock there. Do you see that? On the left. Okay  I'm gonna zoom in for you. You see that? 5:57. It's 6:11.\nThat counts  right? That has to count. That counts—\nWe found the clock. That's the clock. The museum did not\nhave to be open. It didn't— it never said\nthat it had to be open. So let's get outta here. Okay  let's go \nlet's go  let's go! Well  that... We really averted disaster there. Our next location\nis the Waipu Caves. And our challenge is... Find a glowworm at Waipu Caves. I'm so excited for this. Thank you.\nThis is  in many ways  this is why I wanted\nto take the east route. I wanna see a glowworm.\nI wanted to see the glowworm. We just have to find\none glowworm. Look at that little guy running across.\nIs that a roadrunner? No  he's just a little guy. Okay  Waipu Caves entrance. Let's do it.\nAlright. Okay  so just be real careful. Oh man  it's\nreally just a cave. It's legit just a cave. Let's get our lights going. Oh  this is so scary. What's the hell? This is crazy! This is an insane thing. Oh my god. (softly) We gotta find glowworms. (hushed) Yeah  we gotta find\nglowworms. We should go... I'm gonna eat so\nmany (bleep) glowworms. Don't eat glowworms.\nDon't eat glowworms. We're gonna go left  Ben.\nLeft  left. This way? Left  that way is left. (whispering) This feels insane.\nWhat's happening? This should be so illegal. Okay  now that\nwe're back here... let's try turning our lights off and seeing if we can\nsee a glowworm. Okay. (gasp) Oh my god. Can you see them? I dunno if they're\nshowing up on the camera. Here  I'm gonna take some long\nexposure pictures of them. Oh my— They're so pretty. It looks like a night sky. I would describe that in you know  a very serious way as being quite magical. Okay  Toby  I just\nrealized something magical. We're actually safely ahead. That's good  because\nyou know what  Sam? I think I've done the thing. What is the thing?\nA terrible thing. Which is  you know when\nyou kind of close your door  but you don't really close\nyour door and it's kind of... Oh yeah  well  I've\ndone that twice today. I'm looking for the first\nopportunity to close the door. Well— And that makes me feel\na little bit less stressed. Best I can tell  you have\nthe time to close your door. That's great news  Sam. That's great news.\nWow  so that makes— Wow  so we just... That western route \nthat was... That was the right call. That was easily the right call. Look  I know we're in a hurry. Let's just go a little\nfurther down. Just keep going. Let's just really get in here. (whispering) Oh  you can\nsee 'em on the video now. Oh  they're so (bleep) blue. It's incredible. Oh my gosh. I really want to know\nwhat they'll taste like. Don't eat them.\nYou can't eat them  Ben. I'd really like to eat one. Okay... We gotta go.\nOkay. We've seen glowworms.\nThis was awesome. We've already spent\nextra time in here  just 'cause they're so cool.\nWe do have to go. They're so cool.\nThey're so cool. Right. That was maybe the coolest\nthing we've ever done. Yeah  that's amazing. I mean  after being so\nfar behind this morning  and now we're... I'm gonna guess we're gonna\nbe a full 30 minutes ahead. I would not be surprised\nif we get a curse soon. I'm sure Ben and Adam\nare thinking about that. Get this...\nOh yeah  it's closed. Nice. That rocked. So let's...\nA lot. keep going  I guess.\nLet's keep going. Okay  I think that we\nshould buy a curse. I agree.\nJust put it in our deck. See if it's gonna be\nuseful in the future. Just know what we\nhave  don't you think? I agree. Let's do it. We'll do it\nwhile we're driving though. Well  let's get going. Toby  we are on\nthe one road that is a choke point\nbefore Auckland. We do have a safe margin  but I wonder if we \nwhile we have the opportunity  maybe want to draw a roadblock and see if it'd be a\ngood one to put down. To be ahead on a\nchoke point is priceless. We don't have long. Let's get a\nroadblock if we can. Alright  let me\nshuffle the deck. We're gonna shuffle the curses. Okay  I can't really shuffle... when filming well. Let's take a look.\nLet's see what we get. Destroy one ring. Destroy one ring. Find a ring and destroy it. You may find any type of ring  but it must be\nindisputably a ring. That's reasonably hard.\nOkay  let me look— Let me look at what the furthest\nplace from a shop would be. Are you ready? I'm ready. Oh  it's a good one. For the next three McDonald's that are visible from the roadway \nyou must stop there  and each team member\nmust eat something. Oh  nice! That's a good one. I think that's a\nrelatively good roadblock. The best I can tell if we put\nit right before Wellsford... Think it seems like the\nonly shops that exist are gonna be closed by\nthe time they get there. This one  okay. So get ready to throw it.\nThree... Right... right... now.\ntwo... one... That's a good one. It really slows 'em down. (bleep)  they\njust roadblocked us! Okay  well... the powerups are in use now. (forced laugh) Alright. It's very\nnearly rugby time. Kick a rugby ball through the\nuprights at Centennial Park from a distance of at\nleast 49 feet or 15 meters. Team members must\nalternate attempts. Wellsford Rugby Club. Okay  I don't see the things. That's what I was worried about. Yeah  so bizarrely \nthis field does not have posts. Okay  so we need to\nmeasure this out. We've agreed with Ben and Adam. We're just gonna\nvisualize it against this. Okay  10 feet is\njust above these things. Put down my wallet as right.\nSo 50 feet back. We have to kick it\nbetween wallet and post. Above—\nJust above those little things. Yeah  does that make sense? Yeah  yeah. And hopefully we can\ndo a virtual overlay thing. Ready? Yeah.\nThis is gonna be it. I know it. Oh  I need more height  okay. That's alright. Okay. Nope. Oh! Ah  damnit. Oh! (grunting) Ah  damnit! Are they still\nat Centennial Park? Yes. Good. I mean  look  we're only\n20 minutes behind them. I know  but this roadblock... It just depends on how\ngood of a roadblock it is. Alright. This is the spot.\nOkay. We have arrived at the roadblock. Destroy one ring.\nFind a ring and destroy it. You may destroy any type of ring  but it must be\nindisputably a ring. This I think we can do. I'm thinking that the\nbest way to do this is to go to absolutely any\nconvenience store or gas station. Yeah  like a gummy ring.\nAnd get a gummy ring. I mean  just head\nback that way  right  and just go to the\nfirst thing we see. Do we need to start thinking\nabout other options? No! Yeah  it's a 45 minute penalty. We can definitely\ndo it in 45 minutes. I don't necessarily agree\nwe can do it in 45 minutes. I don't know  we've\ngotten relatively close. I'll say that I don't think\nI can do it in 45 minutes  Sam. This is about\nyour confidence now. I mean  I've gotten  not far. I've gotten the height. Yep. Should we watch\na YouTube video? So he's hitting it before. Let's try that  'cause\nthis is a beginner— Dropping it straight\nonto the front  okay. Yeah  'cause this\nis a beginner's one. Let's try it.\nSo maybe that'll help. 'Cause he seems to hit it like that. See  see?\nThat was amazing. Wait  is that— That was in!\nThat was amazing. That was in! Thank you  YouTube! I love you  YouTube! Oh man  that was looking\nbleak for a second. What in tarnation? Hey  wait  we need to quickly figure\nout which route we're taking. So at the next intersection  there's a choice of\ntwo routes to Auckland. They're approximately\nthe same length  but the east route takes\nyou through Silverdale  where you have to have 30 minutes\nof fun at the Megazone arcade. Whereas the west route takes\nyou through Helensville  where you have to have 30 minutes of\nfun at the Helensville Laundromat. Okay  so right now \n'cause the traffic  the west route is only—\nis five minutes... It's five minutes slower. So I guess we should\nstill do the east. We should do the fast route \n'cause there's no advantage doing the west route\nthat I'm aware of. Okay  left. There it is up ahead.\nAlright. That looks promising to me. These are ring-shaped. I mean  they're\ncalled burger rings. This literally says rings. That is indisputable. We can even do a\nsnack review with them. Thank you. Okay. Easy peasy. Alright. Let's destroy a ring. Super quick Snack Zone\nwith Ben and Adam. We're gonna have burger rings. Here's a burger ring.\nIt's indisputably a ring. It's called a ring. I've just destroyed it.\nYou just destroyed it. Okay.\nOh  it's weird. (laughs) Okay.\nI kinda like it though. They have left Wellsford  which is unfortunate \nwhich means... Finally done the drop kick. They must have\ndone the drop kick. We are now going to\nfollow directly behind them  knowing that they're going to\nclear this Megazone challenge. And we can just pass\nthrough without doing it. That way we'll be neck\nand neck with them. I think we could even probably\nget them with a Nerf gun. Ooh. They're following us. Hmm. They're following us? What that means is they're gonna try to shoot us. We need a Nerf bullet. Yeah. So a Nerf bullet costs 10. And the deal with it is that if we manage to shoot\nand hit one of them  then they get delayed\nfor 30 minutes. 30 minute freeze. So we're gonna\nspend 10 of our coins. We're gonna go ahead \nand we're gonna load this in here. So now we are armed and dangerous. We don't have a lot of options other than hoping they don't\nmanage to get us at the Megazone. Yeah.\nOr that we get them first. Should we consider... We should consider a roadblock\nif they're right behind us. Yeah. Shall we draw a thing? Oh  I really hope this is good. Perform a handstand unassisted for a total of one minute. You may string together\nmultiple attempts. Your teammate can help you\nget into handstand position. Ugh  no  it's not good. It's handstand for a minute. Which is really tough to\npredict how long that'll take. We have a good amount of coins.\nWe could pull another one. We could consider a curse card. But if we get lucky with a curse  that could really\nhelp us in Auckland. If you feel confident\nabout a curse— Let's pull a curse.\nOkay. Let's see. Fingers crossed. That's all the coins. During your next challenge  you may only walk forward\nafter rolling a die. Each time you roll a die  you may take the\nsame number of steps as the number you roll. Oh  that is a really good one. I like it. Okay  every—\nEvery time they walk. They're gonna be larking\naround Auckland  up mountains. Yeah  that is actually\nas good as it can get. OP  as they say. Oh dear. So we are stuck in\nhorrible  horrible traffic. One thing I'll say is that\nthis sort of thing can't happen during a normal board game. That is so true. This almost never\nhappens during Monopoly. Ugh. Yeah  let's find a good\nspot to drop the handstand one. Alright  Ben and Adam. I hope you have fun handstanding. Throw it! It's hilly and stuff. That's gonna be a fun\nhandstand spot for them. Sam has thrown down\nyet another roadblock. Yeah. We're not gonna get\nto the roadblock tonight. I think it's too far. Okay. (yawn) This is the spot. Tomorrow at 8 am \nwe will be right here. Oh  that's it.\nThat was our spot. We will see you tomorrow morning. Now it's time for the\nfirst rest period. If you hadn't noticed  everything you've seen so far\nin the first three episodes has happened on day one. Every night between\n9 pm and 8 am  the game pauses for 11 hours  so the players can find a hotel  take an unreasonably long shower \nand get some sleep. Now  here's day two. Here we are. Welcome back... to day two. It is 8 am. It's eight.\nOkay. It's eight  we're good.\nLet's go  okay. I checked the timing. Ben and Adam are\n23 minutes behind. All of that traffic\nthat we had last night  it's dissipated  so a lot\nof our margin is gone. Hopefully that handstand roadblock will buy us seven minutes of margin. Okay  here's the roadblock. Adam  are you ready to find\nout what our roadblock is? I'm ready  I'm worried. The handstand one. Oh  oh  we can do this. We can do this quickly.\nOkay  we gotta hurry. Do this as fast as possible.\nFor a total of one minute. We're blocking these\npeople's driveway  but we're gonna hope\nthat they're chill. Okay  come on  come on \ncome on  come on! If we hurry  then we can maybe\nstill catch them at the Megazone! There it is. Megazone. It's not very mega. Touch the building.\nStart our time. Alright  timer started. Let's start having fun. Alright  here we go. So it's probably only gonna\nbe a few seconds at a time. Okay  I think that's\nmaybe one second. That was one second. That was one second.\n(guffaws) We're at two seconds. 20 questions.\nDo you have a person? No  no  we're not\nstarting 20 questions. We're starting with\nour CookieTimes. So starting up  we have... Cookie Bake by CookieTime. A classic Kiwi snack. Would you like to\nexplain anything more? I don't know  CookieTime \nit's a classic Kiwi thing. You want a treat?\nYou can have a CookieTime. I'm enjoying this. I would even say I'm having fun. You wanna play 20 questions? Have you thought of anyone? Yeah  I've thought of someone. Okay. Is this person a man? No.\nIs this person a woman? Yes. Is this person American? No. Is this person\nfrom New Zealand? Yes. Is it Jacinda Ardern? Yes. (giggles)\nOkay  well there we go. Speaking of Ben and Adam  it seems like they're\nat our roadblock. Oh  our handstand? I think so. But think they've just got there  so we gotta track how\nlong that takes them. That's gonna be crucial. Six. Okay. Whoa! Oh! Here  let's move over here. We got it. Alright. Let's go.\nLet's go. They seem to have just\ncompleted the roadblock. Right  it didn't\ntake them too long. Yeah. I mean \nwe'll be fine for here. Auckland's gonna be tricky. I mean  we knocked\nthat out in 1:15. Yeah  not bad. We're not gonna be able to\ncatch them at the Megazone though. Let's just curse 'em now. —Cursed.\nOh no  I just got a text. Oh  no.\nWe're getting a curse. No  I just said they would be. I cursed myself. For the next three McDonald's\nthat are visible from the roadway  you must stop there  and each team member\nmust eat something. They're trying to slow us\ndown getting to Auckland. So that's... not awesome. It's okay. That's alright.\nI think it's fine. We'll get some breakfast. Alright.\nAnyway  we're still having fun  Sam. Okay  they just said \n\"completed Megazone.\" (bleep) Okay.\nI'm literally... a minute from where I would\nturn off to go to the Megazone. Oh my god. They're way\ncloser than I thought they were. So we've only just\nentered the highway... a few minutes\nbefore these guys  so... Mhm. Dang  they're gonna\nget us at McDonald's. Two minutes behind 'em. (groan) The next three McDonald's that they see  they gotta stop \nthey gotta eat something. And we'll be able\nto fact check them  'cause we'll be looking for it.\nWe're going the same way they are. So if we see a McDonald's \nthey better be stopping at it. Hopefully...\nbefore we get to Auckland... we will be able to pass them. Then if we pass them  we\ncould throw it down roadblocks. We can throw roadblocks. So I'm hoping we can pass them\nafter the next McDonald's. Oh my god. They're right\nbehind us on the motorway. They're— Why are they\nmoving faster than us? I saw the corner of a little red— Oh my god  they're coming.\nThey're coming on the left. They're gonna talk about\nhow the zipper merge is ethical. Zipper merge  baby.\nWe did a video about it. See  right there. There is a McDonald's\nthat will be visible on the right coming up here. Yeah  you can  you can see it.\nIt's right there. You can?\nYeah. Ahahaha! Oh  that is clearly visible.\nLook at that. Yeah.\nShow them. I showed them. Okay. That is clearly\nvisible from the road. They have to go there\nand order something  which means that we\nhave now taken the lead. Here we are.\nThis is the McDonald's. Maccas! (indistinct) Hey  just two hash browns  please. That all for today? Yeah  that's it. Thank you.\nThank you. This is good. McDonald's curse  baby! It's a good curse. One of the best ones  really. Oh  they're on the\nHarbour Bridge right now. Okay. So they're just crossing\nover this harbour in front of us. Should we give 'em the news? Let's give them the news. I don't think\nthey're gonna like this. Shuffling our roadblocks  and then we're gonna just pull one. Maybe we use it \nmaybe we don't  but... We'll see  good to have.\nAgain  the more... You know  if we can slow them\ndown just another 10 minutes... Yeah  it'd be huge for us.\nHuge. Okay. Okay. Oh  okay \nthey've just cursed us. (bleep) Really? What's the curse? Uh-oh. What is it? During your next challenge  you may only walk forward\nafter rolling a die. That's gonna slow us down. Nooo... No  no  no  no  okay.\nThat's gonna slow us down. Nyaaagh! The reason Adam's so\nupset is because this is the Auckland Challenge: Destroy five rings\nat five volcanoes. Acquire five rings of any kind. Starting at the Sky Tower  both team members must go to the top of five different volcanoes and destroy a ring. You must include at\nleast one volcano from three different basalts. Creativity is encouraged\nin ring acquisition. Anything that could reasonably\nbe considered a ring counts. Look—\nWe're (bleep)-ed! We still have—\nWe are absolutely (bleep) Still ahead. Most of these  we don't\nhave to walk very far. No  I know. Some of them\nwe don't have to walk— And we can roll\nthe dice really quickly. We need to have our\nNerf gun ready to go. Oh god  they're probably\ngonna be able to shoot us. Here we go. Can we talk about\na self-defence bullet? I think we  yeah  I mean \nprobably should get one  yeah. I think we\nshould just buy one. We've got 10 coins  right? Yeah  and now's the time\nwe'll want it on hand  yeah. I wanna buy one. Get to load up... one of these. This is parking here\nfor this shopping center. This seems fine. Alright  we're starting\nwith the dice now. One. Three. We're so (bleep)-ed. So with the gun  you\npull this back  right  to load? Yeah  so we should\nhave it cocked basically. I need to put the\ncamera down for this. Okay.\nYou wanna get this? Just properly\nloaded the bullet. Okay  parking.\nComing into the car park. Alright  ready?\nReady to rumble? We don't want 'em\nto see I'm strapped. Americans. This is the Sky Tower. So we can go to that\nconvenience store over there. Two. Oh my gosh. Two. Five. Six. Four  five  six. Or— oh  burger rings. I think it's just gonna\nhave to be burger rings. Burger rings. I mean \nburger rings are rings. Okay. One  two  three  four.\nGonna load this. One  two  three  four.\n(laughs) We're playing a little\ngame with our friends here. One  two  three  four.\nOne  two  three  four. One  two. Okay  here's— No  here's what I\nthink we should do. I think we should go\nhide at the Sky Tower and try to shoot them. Because we know they\nhave to go there  and that's our only shot at winning. What do you think?\nShould we go after them or... Okay. Yes? Let's at least see—\nOkay  but you have to shoot. Let's at least see\nif we can spot them. I think they're across the street. I think they probably\nalready are buying stuff. Let's tap the Sky Tower\nto start the challenge. So we just rolled a six. We need to use our six steps. Try to get them. And he's close. I mean  he's right around\nthe corner of the block. Oh  there he is.\nThere he is. You see him?\nThere he is. Yeah  I see him. This is our chance.\nThis is our chance. There  we've started. Yeah! Ahahahaaa! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Because I don't think they're\ngonna complete this in 30 minutes. We should hunt them down. We're biking on a highway. Just stay to the left! There he is! There he is! That's them! Why are they going that way? Oh  it's moist! Okay  let's go.\nThere's a bit of cheese! We are at the\ntop of a volcano. I feel like I'm gonna throw up. I don't know if it's the stress\nor all the burger rings. Yeah. Probably both. All that and more\nnext week on Jet Lag! Unless of course you're\na Nebula subscriber  because every single\nepisode of Jet Lag is up one week early on Nebula. And next episode  next episode \nI don't even know. I mean  it's one of those episodes where I think we were\ngenuinely worried. Because there's one\nmoment in particular that is just so unbelievable that we don't even know how\nwe're gonna convince y'all that it's not scripted. It's 100 percent not \nbut it's... like... I remember that was our\nprimary concern after it happened. I don't know how. But next episode\nreally is something  and I can't wait\nfor y'all to see it. And of course  but you\ncould see it right now if you head over to Nebula. Because again  we put every single\nepisode there one week early in appreciation of the fact that\nour Nebula subscribers  they basically fund this show. They don't \"basically\" fund this show. No  they literally do.\nThey literally fund the show. Literally all the\nrevenue for this show is from Nebula subscribers. But there's even more than\njust next episode up early. Like  for example... Our Nebula exclusive\ncompanion podcast  The Layover where every week we get together  we break down the episode—\nWith Toby. With Toby.\nWith Toby. Answering y'all's questions. We break down the episode.\nWe answer your questions. We get into the strategy \nthe nitty gritty. So if you're wondering about\nanything with this last episode  and there's a lot to break down. You can go listen to our Nebula\nexclusive companion podcast. And  again  keep in mind \nthat's Nebula exclusive. That is not a\none week early thing. You can only get that if\nyou're subscribed to Nebula. And Nebula has so much\nmore than just our podcast. There's a ton of Originals\nfrom other creators. We've made a bunch of Originals  that I imagine will pop up now. Brian and Joseph \nformer Jet Lag guests  both have original\nseries on Nebula. There are Nebula First videos  where creators put\ntheir videos up early exclusively on Nebula. And most importantly \nwhen you subscribe to Nebula  you're supporting the show.

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nback to episode four of our race to the\nbottom of New Zealand. Just as a refresher  the highway system has been\nturned into a board game. Players have to clear\nchallenges to progress  and powerups can be used\nto sabotage the other team. Right now  both teams\nare in Auckland competing to see who can\ncomplete the Auckland challenge and claim its\nmassive reward first. Toby and I were feeling\ngood about our chances  because we had just\ncursed Ben and Adam with a devastating walking curse \nwhere they have to roll a die every time they\nwant to take a step. But the tables turned at\nthe end of the last episode  where Ben and Adam managed\nto hit us with their Nerf gun before we could\nclaim any volcanoes  freezing us at the\nSky Tower for 30 minutes while they were free to\nroll their way to victory. Yes!\n(triumphant laugh) Yes! Alright  hurry  hurry! 1  2  3  4  5  6.\n2  3  4  5  6. Roll it. It clear— I was sure\nthey were buying stuff  'cause it showed them across... It showed them right\nin that building. Damn. Overconfidence. I— Well  let's see. We touched. We got shot. They ran away. One  two  three. You wanna get scooters and\ngo to the first volcano? Yeah  I think\nthat might be fastest. Okay  so here's how the\nAuckland challenge works. Auckland is built on\na large volcanic field consisting of 53 volcanoes. We have to travel to\nthe top of five of them  spread across at least\nthree different basalts  which are these\nblobby regions here  and then destroy a ring each time \nLord of the Rings style. The closest volcano\nto the Sky Tower is this one here  Albert Park  which is where Ben and\nAdam are headed first. 1  2  3  4  5. So this is Hobson. We have to go this way. Okay. You lead the way. Gotta learn\nfrom experience  Sam. Somehow  they knew\nexactly the right one to be. How smart are they?\nDang. I guess they figured out\nwe would come from that direction. How did they know we\nwere coming to this pylon? They must have known we\nwere coming from that way  so... We're not walking! Bye! That's a little cheeky. I don't think you're allowed\nto bike on the sidewalk. Which way? Which way? One more block. I think that's another\nUber bike up there  Ben. Let's switch to it. You okay? You okay?\nYou okay? Whoa  whoa  you okay? Yeah. Start by going downhill. Yeah. You got it? (clattering) No. So we have to\nget to the top... of the volcano. Probably unlikely to\nbe able to complete this challenge before them. Unless we go on the offensive now. So I think when this is done... we should hunt them down. Alright  I'm pretty\nsure this is the top. Yeah. I bet the\nfountain's the middle. Let's go there. The one ring.\nWe are at the top of a volcano. Volcano one down.\nOkay  that's one down. Okay  where's the next one? I think we should bike\nas much as we can. It's a nine minute bike.\nI think that— Yeah  that's\nworth it for sure. It's definitely worth it. Taking a right here. So it looks like\nthey're at Albert Park  which is presumably\ntheir first volcano. Well  they've been\nat Albert Park for a while  and they're  I think \non those bikes. I think they've done\none volcano of the five. Yeah  they're going down. I wonder if they're\ngoing to Grafton now. On a bike  do you think? Yeah.\nYeah. They could be on the bike. It can't want us to go\nthrough that bridge  can it? Just stay to the left! Which way? This is it. Oh  this is it? Welcome to Grafton. This is a neighborhood in Auckland that was just paved\nover a volcano. So we're gonna\ndestroy another ring. Sorry.\nSorry. That's volcano number two  and the next one is\nonly three minutes away. Oh  really? Follow me. Wait  wait. If you're gonna walk the bike \nI have to roll the dice for you. Alright. You can take five steps. Okay. One... Two... This is the Auckland domain. I guess let's go to the middle. So it seems that there's\nno more path to the top  and we don't wanna\nbike on the grass. That seems rude. We're gonna have to roll  okay? Okay  six. One  two  three  four...\nLove it. Do you have the burger rings? Oh  nope. Roll. Three. Well  what we should\ndo is complete the curse once we're done with the freeze. Just run to two\nMcDonald's quickly  'cause that'll free us\nup to follow them  right? Three  two  one. And we're free  okay. Alright  here we\nare at McDonald's. That looks like a ring. Yeah  I mean  bagels\nare definitely rings. We can use both ends \nso I think we only need three. So I'll get three Benedict Bagels. And then remove\nsome of the ingredients? Yeah  same charge. Oh  that's just bread! Thank you. Bag secure. Okay. Five. Oop. Four. ...three  four. Six. Great work. This is interesting. Okay  I'll\ndestroy this ring. Is this tree... Seems significant.\nIt's framed. I hope  I think that's\nsome significance. Maybe we'll put that up on screen. That's volcano number three. Number three of five.\nOkay  here we go. Six! Gorgeous. They're at the\nAuckland domain now. It looks like it'll take them\na good while to get back here  where presumably their car is. So I think we'll have\ntime to do Albert Park  run back to the Sky Tower  hopefully find a\nway to cut them off. Let's just track\nthem almost constantly  and our plan's gonna change. Depending on if we think\nthey're close enough to catch. Okay. God. Okay  looks like that's\nthe center up there. Ready? You rip it in half. You don't want to eat it? We rip half each. Okay. There. Okay. We're back. So back up towards the Sky\nTower to hopefully cut 'em off? Mhm. So I think the key\nis gonna be to figure out where their car is. Then we can maybe find a spot  like a hidden spot at the entrance\nto the car park or something. Oh  if we could wait\nby their car and find it  that would be amazing. And we have to route\nback to the car now. Oh  we do? Yeah  'cause the other\nones are too far away. That sucks. There's not one\nthat's closer to here? No. You've checked the map?\nYou're sure? Okey doke. Let's go to the car. Here we go. We're biking on a highway. This is what the map said to do. I don't love this \nbut we're gonna make it through. And it's gonna be okay. How many do\nyou think they have? I have no (bleep) clue. I wonder if there's\nany other car parks. We didn't see them when we\ndrove into the car park. Do you think we should\nlook in this car park? Yeah. Nothing. Nothing. No. Nothing. We're not that far. We're doing good. Wait  let's get\nonto the sidewalk. We turn? We are off the highway.\nThat was terrifying. That was terrifying. Damn  that sucks. Let's check the tracker. Yeah  they're not far at all. Yeah  they're... just blocks away. Anyway  I guess they're\ncoming from this way  yeah. So... Yeah  I think this is unlikely \nbut we might as well try. Here  let's hide around\nthe entrance to that. Can you just\ncheck where they are? Not right now. Okay  fair enough. I think this is a\ngreat hiding spot. Okay  they're right... See if I can... I think we want to go one... Well  no  actually \nlet's go this way. Oh  wait.\nThere he is. There he is. Sorry. Sorry. They're coming. They're coming.\nThey're coming. There it is  the Sky Tower. Yeah  yeah. Oh—! Oh (bleep)! I got you. I got you. For sure. For sure.\n100 percent. (bleep) He got you? Start the timer... Okay  they're frozen.\nLet's go. Let's go. Bye  kids! I can't believe that worked. Okay... so Grafton\nVolcano next  right? Yep. Picking up where they left off. We're basically covering\nwhat they just did  and then seeing who\ncan get the rest. We hadn't looked\nat where they were. We knew there was a\npossibility  but we just... We were on a (bleep) highway. We were literally\nbiking along the highway. We also didn't think that\nhe'd be able to get us while we were on bikes  but... He's a sharp shooter. I think down? We were on something like this. Bye! I don't know how\nmany volcanoes they got. Yeah  I have no idea. It can't have been that many. Maybe none. I think we're still in it. We're definitely still in it.\nWe only have two more to go. And they should\nboth be pretty easy. Well  'cause the thing is they not only had\na 30 minute wait  they must have waited\nhere for a while. I think we're\ndefinitely still in this. Okay  we're just above. We just need to run down\nthat road  20 meters. Alright  let's go.\nLet's go  go  go. This would be in it  yeah. Alright. Disappointing. Those people. Wonder what everyone thinks. We have 12 minutes to go. Mm-kay. The second the\n12 minutes is up  we'll bike as close\nto the car as we can. Yeah. Then we'll roll\ndice to walk to the car. Then we're gonna do\nMount Saint John. And then we have to\ngo to one more basalt. So we have to go a little east. Yeah  Little Rangitoto. Okay  great. Parking is gonna be\nhard for them. That's part of why we did bikes. But maybe we're overestimating\nthe difficulty of parking? We'll just see. I think it's pretty\nneck and neck right now. Go straight. So you're 100% sure\nabout no McDonald's on the way to Rangitoto? No. You're not?\nNo  I checked. And there wasn't any on\nwhat was the direct route. Okay. Go to the right. Three  two  one.\nReady? Here we go. Okay  let's put them here. Okay  five. Love it.\nThree  four  five. Right  we're still\nvery much in this! Okay. Let's boogie. I've got the bagel. Three. Oh  it's moist! Okay  let's go. There's a bit of cheese. Oh  they're driving. They've just left the city.\nThey're on Hobson Street. I think it's pretty much go \ngo  go is the approach right now. Yeah. We're not gonna\ngo to Mount Saint John. We're just looking at that.\nIt's pretty tall. It's tall and\nwe're too slowed down. With the dice. So we're gonna go to one\nthat's a little further called Te Pou Hawaiki \nwhich is a little out of the way  but it's seemingly just\nanother neighborhood. It's like a volcano\nthat got flattened. Yes  which is allowed \nis specifically allowed. So this one should\nbe easier for us to Yeah  totally.\ndo quickly. Okay  so this volcano\nis at the intersection of Cecil Road and\nEpsom Avenue. So we actually won't\nhave to even walk at all. No  we can just get right\nout of the car and do it. Okay  so this is Epsom up here. It's this intersection. Alright. Five. One  two  three  four  five. Two. Six. One  two... Okay  this is good. So this inter— I mean \nright here  this is— We're on top of a volcano. Flattened. There you go. Volcano number four.\nOkay  that's four. Alright  let's hurry \nlet's hurry  let's hurry. Perfect on the parking. I think probably\nright here  right? Oh  yes. We're in. Yeah  that's\nthe zone right there. Alright  let's just run\nright in  right out. Done  back. Okay  what do you think now? Let's check with— I need one more minute\nto look at the map. Before you drive  can I just... That's where we've just done. That's a crater in the ocean.\nWe can't go there. That's where I wanna go \nMount Hobson. Mount Hobson. It's just all down to how fast\nwe can get up it  I guess. Yeah. They're a couple\nblocks behind us. It's a small park. Okay. I think we need a Nerf bullet. Okay. We're gonna\narm ourselves. We're gonna spend 10 coins\non another Nerf bullet  because it looks like we might be\ngoing for the same last volcano. Yep. We are loading a\nbullet into the gun. Just in case. This is what\nMount Hobson looks like. Yeah.\nIf we park in there... It might be steep \nbut we might get to the top. Yeah  it's\njust gonna be a run. It might be really steep. Well  too late to change now. It's too late to change. That's them! Wait. Why are they going that way? Do you think\nthat's the entrance? Yeah. (bleep)\nSorry. Go  go  go. You didn't park  Sam.\nYou didn't park  Sam. I did parking brake. Let's go  let's go. Whatever  doesn't matter. All we have to do is\nfocus on our volcano. Yeah  yeah  yeah. I don't know where they're going. And we're five minutes away. So  I mean... (bleep) Ben. Didn't lock the car \nbut it's a problem for the— Go  go  go  go.\nI need to lock. Oh my god.\nI feel like I'm gonna throw up. I don't know if it's stress\nor all the burger rings. Yeah.\nProbably both. Probably both  okay. Once this car goes... This is the park. This is the park up here. I'm just gonna\npark behind these people. Sorry! A little bit further! It's right over there. One  two  three. Okay  it's just up that hill.\nSix. 1  2  3  4  5. Bagel! Done! Texting  texting  texting. Three!\nAh (bleep)! They texted. That was amazing. I can't believe we\npulled that off. Okay  shall we? I don't leave Jet Lag\nin an ambulance. Haven't tried hard enough. (bleep) Really?! Oh  sorry  there's\na playground there. I'm so sorry! No. No! That's literally  I mean \nBen  that's literally... maybe 45 seconds? It was there. If we got there  we would've won. Feeling good. Ben said that they were\n50 feet from the summit. Whew. So  the run was worth it. That was really tight. Oh my god  I knew it was. Because when I was running up  I just knew it was close. And I was so suffering. But I thought...\nYeah  the effort was worth it. The last thing I want\nis to lose this by a second. That was so devastating that it seems like it was staged. Literally  literally 50 feet. I can't— I just— I know that sometimes\npeople are like  \"Oh  they stage\n(bleep) on this show.\" That is absolutely what\njust happened to us. Okay  we gotta get... to the stupid goddamn gate. (bleep) That sucks  Ben! I can't believe that. I cannot believe that! So we are off. So we do still have to stop\nat one more McDonald's. But it's a little cheeky  but it was designed this way\nto be a little cheeky. Ben and Adam\nare not allowed to pass through the next\ngate until we do. So there's a McDonald's\non the way to the highway. Oh  okay  before the gate.\nYeah. So we're just gonna\nhave to stop at that one. So we'll complete that  and then we'll be\ndown to Hamilton. Oh my god!\nI'm just— And this is such a\nhorrible thing to do  but I'm just imagining my head  any number of things that had we done them\n30 seconds faster... Yeah. It's like even if we had\nrolled better numbers on the dice. That's what we call... content.\nI'm genuinely... ...shell-shocked. Maybe shell-shocked\nisn't an appropriate word to use for how I'm feeling. I'm just shocked.\nI'm regular shocked. No  I would\nsay that we suffer as much as soldiers do. Thank you. Mac 'N Cheese Bite review. I'm a little whelmed. Well  they've just\npassed through the gate. They've passed\nthrough the gate  so we can go through it now. Now the roads diverge. And they diverge quite a bit. We are approaching Hamilton  which is where things deviate. So we have got to decide. Okay  here we reach one of the biggest\nroute divergences on the map. But before I explain it to you  let me tell you why making\nit through this next region first is so important. As you may have noticed \nNew Zealand has two islands connected by a ferry. Whichever team gets\nhere to Wellington first and completes its challenge\nwill earn tickets on a ferry two hours and 45 minutes\nearlier than the other team's. It's a huge advantage. Now let's talk about\nthis divergence. It starts with a simple choice:\neast or west. This side leads to two options. Normally it would be three  but this road \nand therefore this route  shut down for maintenance today. Of the remaining options \nthis one's faster  but you have to knit\nand make cheese. This route's slower \nbut all you have to do is Zorb and\ngo to a hot spring. If you really wanna get ahead \nyou could go west  but it's a bargain. You can unlock what's\nby far the fastest route  but only by completing a\ndifficult challenge: milk pong. You only have five attempts\nto throw a ping pong ball into a solo cup full of milk\nfrom eight feet. If you can't  vetoing isn't\nan option for this one. So the road stays locked  and you're forced onto\na much longer route with several difficult challenges. So  as is often the case \nteams must decide just how much risk\nthey're willing to bear. I'm a bit on the fence\nbetween the two options. Ugh! I genuinely have no\nidea what we should do. I mean  milk pong is... That's tough. That's risky. That's very risky. uuuaaaAAAAGH! I dunno. The milk pong thing\nis so nerve-wracking. It scares the hell out of me. The milk pong is sort of\nlike a Hail Mary route  and we don't need a Hail Mary. We're right behind.\nNo. But if they go east  I'm also really scared\nto follow behind them. Because they\nhave a lot of powerups  and they can slow us\ndown with roadblocks. We could both go east and then take different\nroutes in the east. So there's\na route going east that does this... Zorb track. That's what I would\npredict that they would do. And so we could go\naround the other way  but there are two pretty\nchallenging things that we would have to do.\nIt's faster. But we would\nhave to knit a square and we would\nhave to make cheese. You know how to knit  right? I can do the knitting. Okay  we just\nneed to get materials. It's actually\njust the cheese. It's actually an easy trip  except for the cheese. I don't think\nthey'll do that route  because I don't think\nthey know how to knit. And I don't really\nwant them following us. Should we— okay \nshould we lock it in? Should we go for that? Yeah. I'm happy\nto do the knitting. Yeah  and there's a\nKnit World in Hamilton if we wanna go there. That's  yeah  yeah. Okay  well... we are in the lead. They got to\nthe decision point. They stopped and started driving\naround in Hamilton. Yeah. So we passed them. Which means that\nthey've now left open what we believe is the\nbest route through this region. It includes the Zorb track. Yes.\nWhich is our next challenge. We just gotta Zorb quick. We do have to\ndo a very quick Zorb. We have to do one of the quickest\nZorbs anyone's ever seen. Complete a ZORB track. At least one team member\nmust complete any track available at Zorb. Zorb  by the way  is a thing\nwhere you roll down a hill in a big inflatable ball. Why is it called Zorb? No idea. Thank you.\nThank you. Okay  we are now on\nour way out of Hamilton. We're making it to Tirau.\nIt's our first stop. Knit a square in front\nof a giant metal sheep. Tirau is well-known for\nits giant metal sheep. In this challenge \nteams must knit a square of at least two inches\nby two inches in front of the sheep. Looks like the\nboys are going up. They're not going to Tirau. They've passed the junction. So they're going\nto the Zorb route. They're going\nto the Zorb  yeah. I would— personally \nI would love to Zorb  but I don't think that\nit's the right move here  'cause all of their\nslowdowns yesterday seem to be to go to\nplaces like Zorbing. Zorb. Zorb. Zorb. Zorb.\nZorb. Zorb. Zorb. Zorb. Zorb! Zorb! Zorb!\nZorb! Zorb! Zorb! ZORB! ZORB! ZORB!\nZorb! Zorb! Zorb! We're Zorbin'  baby. Oww  ahh! We're Zorbin'. Eyy  we're gonna do a\nlittle bit-a Zorbin'  y'know! Oh  it's very pretty up here.\nThere's so little— Ooh  show everybody. Beautiful! ♪ Oh  we're Zorbin' ♪ It's like we're in\nOz or something. Wow! The trees are pretty cool. We're gonna Zorb the fastest\nanybody has ever Zorbed in their (bleep) life. So I guess\nwe go down there... and then they send\nyou up to Zorb. Welcome to Tirau! Oh wait  I think I see it there. Oh yeah  wow  yeah.\nThe white thing. That's pretty giant.\nThere's a dog and a sheep. There it is. Yeah  I gotta say  that is the largest\nsheep that I've seen. Do you want a tutorial? I want\nas fast as possible. The first step is I\nhave to cast on the stitches. Good luck  Adam! Okay  this actually is\nmore frightening than I expected. Here we go. It's supposed to be\n[indistinct]. You alright? I'm ready. Oh my god! Oh no! (laughs ecstatically) Alright. Whoa! Just knitting. Last couple of stitches here. My handy pink little pocket knife. And then... Alright  quick measure.\nGot a little jellyfish. We want at least two\ninches by two inches. Easy  oh  by far. More than enough.\nAlright. Nicely done.\nThat was so efficient. I think this route was\ndefinitely the way to go. They're probably bumbling about\nboth literally and figuratively. Oh  Adam really seems like\nhe's struggling in his Zorb. Whoa! Adam  how was your Zorb? I Zorbed the heck outta that! Yeah! Let's go. I was totally\nZorbing in there. Let's get out of here. Alright  let's keep going.\nLet's go make cheese! Make cheese in front of the\nlargest cheese factory. At the Fonterra cheese factory  the largest cheese factory\nin the southern hemisphere  make at least one\nmarble's worth of cheese. So it turns out apparently\nmaking cheese is easier than I would've thought. We only need milk and\nvinegar to make a kind of homemade cottage cheese. So the broad steps are\nto boil some milk  and then once it's hot \nadding vinegar to it. And that should straight away\nstart this kind of reaction of the curd separating\nfrom the whey. Alright  here's a gas station. Milk and vinegar. Oh  malted vinegar.\nYeah. Oh yeah. Perfect. Thank you.\nThank you. Okay. Okay  extremely quick Zorb\nas promised. I loved the Zorb! The Zorb was awesome! We had a great time Zorbin'. I can't believe that they\ndecided instead of Zorbing... that they were gonna have to\nknit and make cheese. Okay  I think I see it.\nOh  I see it. I see it on the horizon.\nBig white building. Alright  let's hope that they\nhave a cheese-making zone. Yeah  let's just pull off here.\nThis is the perfect spot here. Yeah  this is\nactually made for us. And this is the\ncheese-making spot. This seems almost like\nit's a designated cheese— It is the designated\ncheese-making spot. Alright  this should be good to go. Alright  that is on. So I don't think we\nshould put too much. I actually worked out that\nif you got 50 mL of milk  it would be two mLs of Okay  I have no idea\nwhat 50 mL is. I'm gonna just cover\nthe bottom  basically. Yeah  it should... So  I turn— Once it starts\nboiling  I turn it off  right? And then  pour it in\nand then start stirring. Yes. It's almost boiling. It doesn't have\nto be fully boiled. Hey  ready? You think that? Yeah. So our next challenge\nis actually sort of a fun little joke about how the other\nroute involves making cheese. Eat cheese at a\nrelaxing hot spring. The team must visit and spend\n20 minutes in Kerosene Creek  where both team members must\neat a piece of cheese and say  \"Gee  I sure am glad I'm\nnot making cheese right now.\" Okay  we're having a little\nbit of trouble finding cheese  'cause this city is laid out\nin a really confusing way. Yeah  we were on the wrong\nside of the highway  but there's a median  and then\nwe tried to get to the other side  and then we couldn't \nand it was a whole mess. Oh  it's already curdling.\nYou see that? Oh  that's perfect. Yeah  see? It's perfect.\nOh man  that was so easy. I mean  we definitely\nhave a marble worth of it. And that's what it was about. See that? That's cheese! There  just have a little bite. Cut to Toby suffering\nfrom food poisoning. Yeah  no  it's actually legit. Alright. Let's send it! That was really quick. I think way quicker than\nthis challenge was expected to be. Sam and Toby are\non the move once again. Really? Which means that they\nmade cheese pretty quickly. I thought that would\nbe almost impossible. Turns out it's really\neasy to make cheese. That's kinda cool. Not cool for us though. It's fine. We need to relax and\nenjoy Kerosene Creek. (sigh) Okay  Ben and Adam seemingly\nare just leaving Rotorua  which is basically where\nthe Zorb track is. So they're on their way\nto that springs that they have to\nchill in for a while. So we're basically\nneck and neck in terms of how far \nin terms of latitude. Okay.\nBut they have to stop. So hopefully that\nbuys us enough time to do the Huka Falls challenge. We've done both of\nour challenges on this one. Yeah. Here we are. The two cheese selection. Well that's as many—\nNo  it's a three— Three cheese selection. Great. That's as many cheeses\nas we need  certainly. Alright. Kerosene Creek. Okay  here we are... at Kerosene Creek. Here we go. It's actually\nvery lovely here. Oh (bleep) Oh... that rocked. Well  I sure am glad that\nI'm not making cheese. Well  I sure am glad that\nI'm not making cheese even though apparently that\nwould be (bleep) way faster. I sure am glad that\nI am not having to chill at the thermal wonderland. That'd be a\nvery stressful chill. It's time for a really special\nedition of The Snack Zone. No  I'm very stressed out\nand I don't like this cheese. Yeah. There's no one here. There's literally\nno one (bleep) here. And this is like\na lovely natural bath. If I lived here  I would\nbe here every day. What gives? Okay  I'm gonna check\nwhere Adam and Ben are  but first  it's time to be real! I think we're\nnearly done here. Yeah. In Kerosene Creek. They're gonna\nbeat us to Huka Falls. We could potentially buy a curse. We do wanna slow them down\nas much as we possibly can. Yeah. 'Cause we... really want to\nget on the 1 pm ferry. But even more \nwe want to stop them from getting on the 1 pm ferry.\nYeah. 'Cause if both teams miss it \nthen we're just both on the 3:45. And it's still neck\nand neck and we could still pull out a victory. Yeah. So remember that ferry\nwe're talking about before? We're getting closer to it. Quick reminder \nthe team that completes the Wellington challenge first\nwill earn a ticket on the 1 pm ferry tomorrow. The next team will have to\nwait until 3:45. But  and this is important \nif neither team makes it in time to get on that 1 pm ferry \nboth teams will be on the 3:45. Because they're behind  Ben and Adam's strategy\nis pretty simple. They don't need to\nmake the ferry. They just need to\nmake sure we miss it. Which means slowing us down\nany way they can. Yeah  I mean I just can't\nthink of that many curses that are gonna slow them\ndown at Huka Falls. That's true. Most of them involve\nslowing down your movement  and you just don't\nhave to move that much. I think that we should just\nmake an attempt for the Nerf. We should attempt to Nerf them. At Huka Falls. Yeah  we'll put\non our disguises. We'll see how well\nthat could work. Maybe they'll be gone by then. Yeah. But then we can just catch\nthem at the next intersection. Alright  that is\n20 incredible minutes of relaxing in Kerosene Creek. And now we have to very\nfrantically get our stuff and go 'cause we are behind again. Alright  Ben. I think it's disguise\ntime  my friend. Time to get our disguises. Hello. I for one am excited to utilize my androgynous features. Okay  we gotta run. Next stop  Huka Falls. I'm optimistic  but we gotta\nmake sure I think we're ahead and have enough time\nwithout worrying about Nerf  but only if we are\nefficient with our time. I've got gun fever  Adam. Yeah. I want to shoot Sam so bad. We're out here really\nBonnie and Clydeing. We're embracing our \nyou know  feminine wiles. Absolutely. And... Yeah  I am gonna\nshoot Sam in the eyeball. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Well  if you want to\nsee if these guys catch up to us at Huka Falls... you can find out\nnext Wednesday  or... if you're a Nebula\nsubscriber  right now. That's because every\nsingle episode of Jet Lag@12 we post one week early\nand without ads on Nebula. And we're even doing more\nthan that this season with what's called The Layover. Now live on the podcast  I'm going to attempt\nthe milk pong challenge. I have red solo cups  and I have ping pong balls. Okay.\nHere we go. Okay  we ready? He's taking his first shot. There it goes. It was really close.\nOh  it hit the top of the cup. I think what led to the mess up was just literally the same thing\nthat happened in Tag Across Europe of just being overly\ntrusting in the tracker. I love cheese that's\noptimized for speed. That's a quality\nI look for in my cheese. Yeah. The fastest. In my YouTube profile picture  I'm wearing a knitted\nKlein bottle hat  and there's a video\non my YouTube channel of me knitting that hat. But it's from five\nor six years ago. Guys gotta up your\noppo research game. We got punished for\nnot being huge Toby heads. So if that sounds interesting  if you have a ton of free time\nand you want to hear us break down in\nexcruciating detail all of the ways that Adam and I\ncould have pulled out Auckland because it was that close. They really like\nto make that point. It was that close! It was that close. I would even say\nit was that close. We do this podcast\nevery week with Toby. And we break down the episodes\nand we answer your questions. And you can listen to that\npodcast exclusively on Nebula. Nebula  you've definitely\nheard us talk about Nebula before. It's a creator-owned and\ncreator-founded streaming service that's designed to be the\nbest home for our content. And it's definitely the\nbest place to watch Jet Lag  because of course \none week early episodes  you get access to the podcast. You also get access\nto the aftershows of all of the other\nseasons that we've done. You also get access\nto Crime Spree  which is an entire\nseason of Jet Lag that is exclusive to Nebula. And if you watch any\nof these creators who I'm gonna pop up\non the screen now  they're popping up on the screen. They all make things for Nebula. A lot of them have\nexclusive content on Nebula. A lot of them are\ndoing episodes early  just like Jet Lag does \non Nebula. And also when you\nsubscribe to Nebula  you're helping to\nsupport the show. And how does that work? It's actually not just\na broad concept. It's actually that\nevery single month  if you use our link \nbut only our link  nebula.tv/jetlag\nYou have to use our link. You gotta use our link \nbut if you use our link  we get a portion of\nyour subscription fee for as long as you\nstay subscribed. So that's predictable \nrecurring monthly revenue  which is the best type of revenue. And what do we do\nwith that revenue? We reinvest in the show.\nWe make it bigger and better and more frequently\nand everything. I mean  you can already\nsee the difference between this season\nand season one. Big difference. And we want to just keep\npushing that bigger and bigger. So that's why we're\nso appreciative of our Nebula subscribers. They really do make\nthis show work  and they also make\nthis show better. So yeah  head to our link  nebula.tv/jetlag to sign up. And you'll actually get $20 off an annual subscription\nat that link. But only that link.\nYou gotta use that link. So thank you in advance\nfor signing up and... See you next week!\nSee you next time! Bye!"

        "transcript": "Welcome to episode five of our race across New Zealand. Here's the state of the game. Right now  both teams\nare racing to Wellington. The first team to\ncomplete that challenge at the bottom of the North Island will be able to take\nthe 1 pm ferry tomorrow  a full two hours and 45 minutes before the next ferry at 3:45. At the moment \nToby and I are in the lead on our way to Huka Falls. That's the site of\nour next challenge. Ben and Adam are\n30 minutes directly behind us  and if they want any\nhope of overtaking us to get on that first ferry  they're going to have to\nhit us with their Nerf gun  which would freeze us\nfor 30 minutes. Fortunately  they've got\na plan to avoid detection. Alright  we are\nheaded to Huka Falls. We are locked and loaded. Let's see if this works. Thoughts? It's so big and fast. Yeah. Anyway \nspeaking of fast. Wait  wait \nI didn't say hello. No  film me saying hello. Yes  say hello. Hello.\nHello. Hello. Okay  now let's go. Are you using\nyour sparkling water? I guess so. We need sparkling water \nbecause our next challenge is: Waterfall at Huka Falls. After saying hello to Huka Falls  one team member must waterfall any beverage into\ntheir teammate's mouth from at least 10 feet above. Once the teammate\nreceiving the beverage has caught enough to fill\n80% of their gold cup  the challenge is complete. I think let's look over here. I might have to climb a tree. Sam. I don't think\nthat's tall enough. You don't think\nit's tall enough? I'm gonna measure 'em here. Oh yeah  just does it. Are you sure?\nYeah. You're gonna have to pour and film. I'm gonna go here so that people are less concerned\nby what we're doing. I have to lay all the way down. Oh  this is so cray! Oh  you gotta be quick. Yeah  okay. Go for it. (wheezes) I'm so sorry  Sam. This is really difficult.\nThat's okay  keep going. Okay  it just updated. It's looking like\nthey're at the falls now. I mean  who knows how\nlong this will take? One sparkling\nwaterfall coming up. We're out. I'm gonna go get another bottle. Alright  it's full. It's full? Check.\nYeah. Alright  let's go. We gotta go. You really took one\nfor the team there  Sam. At times it felt\nlike waterboarding  but it's fine  'cause\nwe got 15 coins. Okay  well it would seem\nthat they've just left Huka Falls. We're  what  13 minutes\nbehind them? It would seem we may have\nput on the dresses for nothing. But we could follow them along the next route \nafter the next intersection. Okay  so Ben and Adam\nwill have to go through that roundabout that\nwe just went through. I believe they're gonna be\nabout 10 minutes behind us. One thing that's interesting \nand I'll do some research as we go  but I noticed that\nthere's a stretch that seems to be really\nempty on this route. If we pull the right roadblock  that could be a pretty\ndevastating spot. So maybe we should\nthink about that. Well  the route\nto Napier is coming up. Yeah  I mean  we could go east and get a lot of powerup points... but the challenge\nthere takes a while. But we're close enough to them\nthat I don't want to give up on still leading them to Wellington and getting on the 1 pm ferry. No  and we want to\nkeep open the possibility of being able to shoot them. So I think we're\ngonna follow them  and then we'll see... There's another intersection\nwhere they can go east or west. And we'll see what they do \nand then see how we wanna respond. Okay. I can confirm that\nBen and Adam are following us. They did not go the other route.\nFollowing us. Yeah  yeah. So here's my thinking. I think we have a really good\nopportunity now to give them just a\ndevastating roadblock. Because there's this\nreally long stretch on the drive that we're doing\nthat I don't think has any shops. And a lot of the roadblocks\nrequire you to buy something. Alright  well let's\nsee if we can get— Again  we want brutality. Are we doing it? Yep. So we get... Wear a new hat. Wear a new hat. Buy a new hat and wear it\nuntil the rest period. The hat does not necessarily\nneed to be advertised as a hat  but should it be removed\nfor any non-essential reason before the next rest period  you are frozen for\nthe next 20 minutes. The hat must be at least\nthe size of your hand. Buy a new hat and wear\nit until the rest period. That is perfect!\nI love it. Oh! That is not gonna be— That could not have gone better. Yeah. Alright  let me do some research and find a brutal spot to put that. Do you know anything\nabout that volcano? No... is that Mount... ...Ruapehu? It's... ...Tongariro? I think.\nOh! Do you have any\ninformation to share with us about that mountain  Ben? No. Okay.\nDo you? No.\nGreat. Well then  we'll just— No  I think I do.\nI think that this is where... I think... that this is where Mount Doom is. Right  this road\nright here to the left... Just past is gonna be our drop spot. Okay  you ready to toss it? Toss  toss it. Ready?\nReady? Go! Alright  Ben and Adam. Good luck finding a hat. Okay  Adam  I've got\nsome not so great news. Sam is thrown down a roadblock. I mean  it's the only\nroad we can drive on  so we've just gotta do it. And we'll find out what that\nroadblock is when we get there. But hopefully it's an easy one. I mean  the last one they\ndid was a pretty easy one. That's true. That's true. Alright. We have reached the roadblock. Now we're gonna find out what it is. But let's actually get\noutta the car to do it. First of all  'cause it's beautiful.\nAnd second of all... I'm gonna change out\nof my dress. We're gonna\nfind out what it is. Wear a new hat.\nOh no. Okay. Well  we have to buy it. So we're gonna need to find\nwhat the nearest store is. That would sell\nsomething resembling a hat. Right  it doesn't\nhave to be a hat... But we do need something. We have to buy something. Let's see what the nearest If there's—\nstore is. Yeah  if there's not\na store within 15 minutes  then we should just veto it.\nYeah. Because the veto period\nfor roadblocks is 30 minutes. I've got a feeling... that Sam knew exactly\nwhat he was doing. Yeah  this (bleep) is sparse. God dammit.\nLet's look on Google Maps. Sometimes they have—\nOkay  lemme get my phone. I mean  I don't—\nI literally see like nothing. No  it's literally just— The Google Maps is\njust  it's green. Do you see anything? No  I don't\nsee anything at all. I don't see anything. I literally\ndon't see anything. I think we\nshould just veto now. Okay  okay. Yeah  yeah. Veto  we're vetoing it right now.\nOkay  we're vetoing it. Touché  Sam.\nThat was a well-placed roadblock. Fair enough. Fair play. So what time is it?\n(bleep) 6:51. 7:21  we can keep going. Damn it! Mm-kay. That sucks. So you might notice\nBen and Adam are not moving. They'll probably\nrealize pretty quickly that it's gonna be a tough one\nto do there and veto it. But still  30 minutes \nthat's a good amount of window. That's a good margin for us to do the next couple challenges.\nThat's enough to eat carrots. But yeah  I mean \nI think this will build us a healthy margin for\nthese challenges. Hopefully for the\nPalmerston North challenge to allow us to close in\non Wellington ahead. That's our wish. That's what'll get us\non the right ferry. So here's the next intersection. When we arrive at Tohunga Junction  we'll have two options. We could go west\non a route that's 135 minutes and has one challenge\nhere in Whanganui. Frankly  it's hard to predict\nhow hard this one will be. Or we could go east\non a 125 minute route and do two challenges  but both of them are\npretty reliably easy. There's no real need\nfor us to take a risk  and we should get\nmore coins going east. So that's our plan  which means\nour next challenge is: Eat a carrot at the\nOhakune Carrot Adventure Park. Between both team members  you must consume\none full-sized carrot or five baby carrots\nwithin the boundaries of the Ohakune Carrot Adventure Park. Okay  so in five minutes  we'll be at the\nsupermarket in this town. Every minute matters at this point. So it's just\nsuper  super quickly. I'm gonna look for baby carrots. Big carrot we'd have to\npeel and stuff. I can eat a full carrot.\nIt's not that big a deal. The soil is good for you \ngives you selenium. Yeah  New World Supermarket. Alright  good news \nno carrot shortage. Alright  I got a\nfew different options. There's this short and stubby one \na long and thin one. I think this one seems\nlike the lowest volume one. I really hope it's fine that we\nhaven't peeled it or washed it. I wouldn't have thought twice\nabout eating a carrot that I just bought\nat the supermarket. Alright  we should\nsee the carrot soon. Oh  I see. Oh  well  I think\nthat's probably it. Wonder how this town\nhas decided on \"Let's make a big\ncarrot adventure park.\" Alright  let's go. Okay  welcome back to...\nAlright. Wait  wait. I had a line\nI wanted to do. Oh  you have a line?\nOkay  great. Alright  we're\nstill in the veto period  but more than that... We're in The Snack Zone. Welcome back to\nSnack Zone  baby! It's a show within a show where we review\nNew Zealand's very best and sometimes very worst snacks. And these are Baked Oaty Slices. See  the thing is \nI don't know if this is iconic or popular or anything.\nWe just found it. This is what annoys\nme about those \"Oh  we're trying American snacks\" and it's just stuff\nI've never seen before. Yeah.\nSo I don't know if— This might be nothing.\nThese are Afghan flavored. I don't really know what that means \nbut it seems to have pictures of walnuts and chocolate and some other things that\nI can't figure out what they are. It is oaty. Here's a carrot. Here  break it in half. What  you haven't\nbroken it in half yet? I was filming! Oh  no.\nOne person  it's just too short. Okay. There we go. But now you're not gonna want it \n'cause you don't want my germs. It's fine. I'll sacrifice here. Come here  come here. Alright  let's go. Oh  good carrot. I wish we had time to\nplay in the Adventure Park. (coughs profusely) Eating it too aggressively. Alright  I'm gonna get\ndirections while you finish up. I think that's it.\nOne more little bit? It's still my carrot.\nOne more little... Come on  we gotta go!\nWe're to race! Alright  that's it.\nThat's just the stem. Oh my god  come on  come on! Urgency! I have to finish the challenge. I know. I'm saying urgently finish. This is still a carrot.\nI know. Urgently finish! No  I'm still fine.\nOkay okay  sorry. Don't mean to rush you.\nTake all the time you need. Don't eat the stem. I'm not eating the stem. That is the stem. Okay  there we go  let's go. And now we have more snacks. Alright  send it. Okay  our 30 minutes is up. So we can continue\nalong our route. Fair play to Sam and Toby. That was a well-placed roadblock. You bastards. Looking at the tracker  Sam and Toby have taken\nthe turn towards Okahune. So we have to decide\nif we wanna follow them or if we want to go the other way\ntowards Palmerston North. Okay  so here's my logic then. The challenges that they're doing\non that route are very easy. So yeah  they're\nclearing them for us  but it's not like it's\nactually helping that much. No  we're not gonna\ncatch up that much. No. So we might as well... just take the other route and actually get some\nmore powerup coins... in Whanganui. And we'll converge in\nPalmerston North anyway. Yeah  and I don't want to\nget hit with another roadblock. No  that's the other thing. I mean  they've\nmade it clear that if we follow behind them \nthat they're gonna drop roadblocks. Yeah  I agree.\nLet's go towards Whanganui. Yeah.\nAnd hopefully... we'll be able to\ncatch up after that. It's the po-po. Oh  he's getting a talking to. Ben and Adam.\nOh yeah  news. Ben and Adam  they have\ncontinued to Whanganui. So they're not following\nus down this route. Which seems to make sense \n'cause they need those 15 coins. They've probably just\nhad enough following us. Alright  we're\nturning right soon. We're looking for the giant gumboot and the Gumboot Throwing Lane.\nIt's right there. There's the giant gumboot. The giant gumboot\nmeans we're in Taihape  the location of our next challenge: Throw a gumboot at the\nTaihape Gumboot Throwing Lane. Taihape  the self-described\ngumboot capital of the world  is home to a massive annual\ngumboot throwing competition. At the Taihape\nGumboot Throwing Lane  throw a gumboot at least 15 meters. We gotta be efficient about this. This makes or breaks whether\nor not we make the ferry. Okay  so take this right. I did the math on the ride here. We do have a shot of\nmaking the 1 pm ferry. So it's gonna be this right. But it's tight. It is very tight. Oh yeah  there's our\ngumboot throwing lane. Here  I think  park here. Oh  I think I see some gumboots. That's going to save us our— That's gonna get us our 15 coins. Alright  let's send it. It shows 10 meters  20 meters. So we need to get it to here. Men's record  56 meters.\nWomen's record  36. Okay  I don't think\nthis'll be hard. You ready? Holy (bleep)  sorry!\nWhoa! (laughs) Almost sat on the train tracks. Ready for this?\nYeah. Okay. That's... bold approach. Okay. Oh  that was it. That was it. That was it  that was 20. That was beautiful. Let's go. What a delightful sport. Yeah. Back on Route One.\nStill the exact same highway as the one we started on\nup in Cape Reinga. Would ya look at that? Oh my god  what?\nLook at those! You know the motto. What's the motto? Anything for views. Anything for views. Oh  look at that!\nLook at those views! Awoo! Hold that out there.\nOh god. ♪ It's pretty ♪ And you know who gets\nto enjoy that pretty landscape? This is just incredible.\nIt's just sheep. It's just for sheep. I wonder if the sheep appreciate it. I wonder if the sheep\nare like  \"This rocks.\" One thing I have to remind\nmyself going through this  'cause we're so focused\non the game  is just how far\nfrom home we are here. On these drives  like now \nwhen we have really nice lighting  great views  and we know\nthat we don't have any more challenges left for today. This is exactly when I'm like  I finally feel like\nI'm able to take it all in. And that's super nice. Yeah  these\ncows are on the hill. Hey friends. No big deal. No big deal. Just cows on a hill. Cows on a Hill would be a\npretty good name for a band. Yeah  I agree. Seconds left in day two. There we go  that's it. Right... right there. Right at the school sign. That was our spot. It is 8:59 and\na bunch of seconds. Oh  and now it's 9. And we'll see you here this\nexact time tomorrow morning. Okay  it's 9 pm \nwhich means day two is over. That's right  we're only through\ntwo out of our five days. The game is now paused\nwhile both teams find a hotel  go to sleep  and dream of\nmaking the 1 pm ferry tomorrow. And now through the magic\nof YouTube  it's 8 am. Alright  it's 8 am.\n8 am  okay. Let's go  go  go  Sam. Happy 8 am. Happy 8 am to you  buddy. Alright  every\nminute matters today in terms of whether or not\nwe can make that first ferry. The good news is both\nof our challenges I think are rather short\nand straightforward. Mount Cleese... If we're supposed to\nsummit Mount Cleese. Summit Mount Cleese. After British comedian John Cleese\ndescribed Palmerston North as the \"suicide capital of New Zealand\"  Palmerston North renamed\ntheir dump to Mount Cleese. Reach the top of the\n45.2 meter mountain that has been dubbed\nMount Cleese. Then we'll be off to  presumably  I think we want to\ndo the western route  the one that involves walking\nthrough the woods blindfolded. As long as there's a chance for\nus to get on that first ferry  taking the shortest route\nseems to make the most sense. Yeah  I think so.\nThat's what I wanna do. I suspect that\nBen and Adam know that. And therefore I suspect that we might have some\ncurses hailed our way. I think the\nname of the game today is just to do\neverything in our power to stop them from making that ferry. I don't think that we\ncan make that ferry. No. But I do think that potentially\nwe can prevent them from making it  and then we're both on the 3:45. And I think the\nfirst thing we should do is buy a curse.\nYeah  okay. Curse stack. I'm gonna go ahead  pull a curse. Okay.\nIs it a good one? No  it is not a good one. What is it? You have to\nlisten to Tom Lehrer's \"Element Song\" loudly on repeat until you reach your next challenge. That's not great. Shoot.\nIt's funny  and it's annoying. And I would love to\nput this on them. But it's not gonna do\nwhat we need it to do. We don't have enough\nfor another curse  but we will after we\ncomplete Whanganui. Shoot. Okay. So let's go complete Whanganui  and then we can reassess and see if we have any other way to slow them.\nThat's not great. That's not great. Okay  so just in case\nwe haven't explained yet  let's talk about what\nthe Whanganui challenge is. Find Whanganui and Wanganui. Whanganui has voted several times on whether or not to\nspell its name with an H  which it has in its traditional\nMāori pronunciation. No widespread consensus\nhas been reached. Find three signs\nthat say \"Whanganui\" and three signs that say \"Wanganui.\" I would say that this\nis looking relatively dense. Yeah.\nHere. Okay  parking. Okay  so it's just three of each?\nYou're sure? Yep  and I would look\nright behind you. Alright  Wanganui with no H. Right there.\nOkay  let's get a move on. (whispers)\nWanganui  Whanganui... Okay  there's a... big banner. Does it say anything? Oh  it might. Oh wait. Yeah  oh  ooh. \"Wanganui Branch\" there. That's without an H. So we've got two without.\nTwo without an H. We don't have any with. Oh  there's one \nanother without an H. Oh  yeah  yeah. So you see that  so. \"Wanganui Branch.\" Okay  so we're all\ngood without the H. So now we need the Hs. Ooh  I think that says Whanganui.\nOfficial. Wait  is that an H? That's an H  yeah. Wait  wait  right here.\nBNZ  right there. That says Whanganui with an H. Kiwibank. Oh  oh yeah  yeah. Kiwibank. Whanganui with an H.\nOkay  that's three of each. That's very fast.\nThat's three of each. Great work.\nGood  efficient challenge. Back to the car.\nThat was very efficient. Woo! How many coins was that? I have no idea. Okay  now I'm\njust gonna route us straight to Palmerston North  right? Welcome to beautiful \nsunny Palmerston North. Exhilarating  right? I think this is the\nentrance to Mount Cleese. aka the landfill. Alright  we're climbing up. There's the sign. Okay  so that's 30 coins. I think another curse. I think we gotta\nbuy another curse. 'Cause if they get\non that 1 pm ferry... We're in trouble.\nWe're so screwed. Okay  we're\nbuying another curse. Okay. Curse is... Oh  this is not helpful either. No  really? What is it? For the next three hours \nyou may not say any words with the letter E in them. Anytime you say the letter E \nyou must stop walking or pull over your vehicle\nfor five minutes. The Wellington challenge\ninvolves a lot of talking. That's true. So let's wait.\nLet's wait. Damn it  that sucks!\nWe had two bad curses! We just blew through 50 coins. 50 coins. 50 coins for\ntwo garbage curses. The Element Song\nwill be funny though. Will be funny \nbut that sucks  man! Okay  well hopefully\nPalmerston North will take them longer\nthan expected or something. Alright  we've summited. Well  we gotta go. Alright  no\ntime to look around. No. Now let's confuse\nthe person at the gate by leaving immediately. Alright on the road down to... I forget the name of the next thing. The hiker thing.\nThe blindfolded hike thing. The blindfolded hike thing. Lead your teammate\nthrough the jungle blindfolded. Blindfold one teammate. The other teammate must lead them\nalong the Mangaone Walkway until they reach the\nmarked stream crossing  and then lead them back. We should check what\nBen and Adam are up to. Whether they've left\nWhanganui yet. See what sort of margin we have. They have left Whanganui. They're on the highway. Okay.\nIt's gonna be a race. Adam to us  31 minute drive. Okay. That's a nice margin. Yeah. But I think we want to grow it  because this challenge could\ntake more than 30 minutes. Wellington could definitely\ntake more than 30 minutes. What do you think?\nShould we pull a roadblock? Yeah.\nAnd then take the top one. Eat something grape flavored. Eat something grape flavored. It must clearly say on the packaging\nthat it is grape flavored. Grapes count. Okay  that can be decent. That takes some time\nif we leave it far enough from a gas station or\nanywhere that they can buy. Maybe you want to research\nalong our route south a good spot to drop that. Okay. Alright  so best we can tell  this is the last gas\nstation for a little bit. So we're gonna drive \nyou know... 15 minutes this way\nbefore dropping the pin. Hopefully Ben and Adam cannot\nfind anything grape-flavored in anywhere closer to our pin. That is the devilish plan\nthat we've concocted here. Alright  Adam  welcome\nto Palmerston North. Thank you so much. We have nothing to do here. We're just gonna continue\nright on through. Yep. And hopefully we'll catch up. Alright  just\nafter this intersection. Ready?\nYou get ready. Three  two  and one. Go.\nGo. Okay  well... our time in Palmerton\nNorth is not going well. They've just thrown\ndown a roadblock. Ugh  okay.\nSo now I don't think we'll be able to catch up\nto them at the river crossing. No  I think they probably\nsaw that move coming. Yeah  probably. (bleep) So this curse we're\nputting on them now. Hopefully it does something. Yeah.\nThat's all we can hope for. I'll let them know. I've just had a text\narrive from Ben saying  new curse on you. Oh?\nFor the next three hours  you may not say any words\nwith the letter E in them. Anytime you say the letter E \nyou must stop walking or pull over your vehicle\nfor five minutes. No talk. Okay. At least... they're kind of annoyed right now. At least they can't\nsay the letter E. And hopefully that's\nmaking them suffer. Walk is one hour. Ah. No talk. I'm trying to remember\nwhat the roadblocks are. Touch a body of water could be. There's a river right there. Oh  there is? Yep. I'm trying to think. Are there other roadblocks\nthat involve buying things? Yes. Eat something grape flavored. Eat something grape flavored.\nYeah  that could hurt. Yeah  I'll just have to see. Look at those mountains.\nPretty cool. ♪ Pretty ♪ Throw an object back and forth at least 10 times\nwithout dropping it. You must stand at\nleast 20 feet apart. Okay. We haven't even gotten\nto the first roadblock  and they just dropped another one. Agh! They're really throwing\na wrench in the works. Let's find out\nwhat this roadblock is. Okay  what is it? Damn! Eat something grape flavored. It's the one we didn't— It's the specific one\nwe didn't want it to be. Okay  let's see. Okay  we need\nto look really quickly if we can get to anywhere where we could buy\nsomething grape-flavored. Gas stations or\nconvenience stores behind us. Okay  there's a\ngas station back here. How far? 22 minute drive. So it's not worth it to go. It's faster to veto. And there're no\nconvenience stores? I mean  I don't see one. No  I mean this is\njust this  it's just this. I mean there's\na gas station  like... like 0.1 miles in front of us. But we can't pass forward.\nWe can't pass the roadblock. Veto  veto now. 9:33 veto.\nWe're vetoing it. (bleep) Ends at 10:03. 10:03  okay. Well... Sam and Toby \nwell played once again. Sam. Right. Loft. Right. Loft. Fast. Alright  well \nveto period complete. Yep. That was a long 30 minutes. But now we're onto\nthe next roadblock. Okay  here we are\nat this roadblock. Let's go ahead... and find out. Okay  okay \nhurry  hurry  hurry. What is it? What is it?\nWhat is it? Play catch. Throw an\nobject back and forth at least 10 times without dropping  and you must stand\nat least 20 feet apart. Okay  that's fine.\nWe can do that. We can do that really fast. Here we go. 10 catches without dropping it. Here we go. One. Slow. Fast. Stop. Follow. Two. It might be easier or\nsafer to throw underhand. Sure. Three.\nThree. This is easy. Four.\nFour. Plank. Straight. No talk. Five.\nFive. Six.\nSix. Seven. Doing really good.\nSeven. Ah! Turn. Go back. Slow. Eight. There you go. Last one.\nNine. Ten... Ten. Okay  done it. Let's go  go  go. Okay  that we nailed. So now we need to\nroute to Peka Peka. We might still be\nable to catch up to them. Stop. Okay  because we can't do a\ngreat explanation in-game right now  here's the next challenge\nlocated in the city of Wellington. The first team to complete this\ncan get on the earlier 1 pm ferry. That is assuming they\ncomplete it in time. Run for Prime Minister. One team member must\nrun for Prime Minister by making promises in front of at least four different\nprominent locations within New Zealand's\ncapital  Wellington. Knit. So they're leaving the\nriver crossing challenge. So we'll be maybe\n20 minutes behind them. So we'll arrive in Wellington\njust a bit behind them. Yeah  maybe like\n15 minutes behind them. That is still enough time. What's happening? Little bit of a traffic situation.\nWhat's happening? Track boys. On way. I think the only\nway we can stop them from getting on the 1 pm ferry is by shooting them. Oh god! If we don't hit them  they'll enter the South Island\nalmost three hours ahead. Nightmare. I'm hoping that we\nwill be caught up to them in the time it takes\nthem to buy a tie. Any delay that they experience... I think is enough. Yeah.\nTo stop them. Okay. No mistak-s. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Kia ora  I'm Toby  running for top job. Nooo! That's them! That's them!\nThat's them. Oh... no. Shh-sh-shh! Sea conditions\ntoday are light. It always is like  Wait  do they know\nsomething I don't? Are they smarter than us? We don't know.\nWe don't know. The entire season has been\nleading up to this one moment  the Battle of Wellington! Will Toby and I get that devastating two hour and\n45 minute head start  or will we have it\nripped away from us at the last minute by these guys laughing maniacally off into\nthe sunset or something? I don't know. You can find out right now\nif you're a Nebula subscriber. And that's because we put\nevery single episode out one week early for\nour Nebula subscribers in appreciation of the fact that\nthey basically fund the show. And you know  what makes\nNebula an even better deal is we're not the only\none that's doing that. Yeah  people actually\nloved the thing where we put Jet Lag episodes a week\nearly on Nebula so much that Nebula created this whole new\nsystem called Nebula First  and now all of these\nother creators do it  like Not Just Bikes or\nLegalEagle. So you can watch all\nof these YouTube videos from all of your favorite creators a whole cycle early\non Nebula. And Nebula's got a whole bunch\nof other great exclusive stuff  like the companion podcast\nfor this show  The Layover  where we break down each episode\nand we answer your questions. And you can listen to\nthat only on Nebula. It's a lot of fun.\nI really like doing the podcast. Yeah  it's great 'cause we love having these\nconversations anyways  'cause we only get to\nsee our side of the show. Right. And so I think we\nalways have questions when we start to see the footage\nand start to see the edit of \"Oh  why did you do that  Adam?\" And this is the—\nand now we just get— It's kind of our job to\nhave those conversations. Which is great  and we\nget to reconnect with Toby. Yeah  Ben and I\nget to hang out— Ben and I hardly got to\nhang out with Toby at all during the season \nso now we get to— And it was two months ago\nwhen we filmed  so now it's great. The reason we do all this\nfor our Nebula subscribers is because they quite\nliterally fund this show. I mean  that has been basically\nall of the revenue for Jet Lag since the day it was founded  and we've been able\nto grow off of that. So we're super appreciative\nof their support through time. And  we're actually... For anyone who really wants\nto help support this  We're trying something\nkind of experimental. We don't know if it'll work \nbut yeah  it's a little weird. So we are now\noffering on Nebula a lifetime subscription. You can become a subscriber\nto Nebula forever. You never have to pay Nebula\nany more money ever. You will always have\naccess to the service. Now  it is not necessarily\nthe cheapest way to get access to Nebula. That's the annual bundle.\nYou can totally do that. But if you want to especially\nsupport the show  right? If you want to really kind of do\nthis crazy thing to help support us  you can  and you\nget access forever. And what that is really great for is it gives us all of\nthis revenue right now that we can put towards\nmaking future seasons. Yep  and regardless\nof how you wanna sign up  You can do so at\nnebula.tv/jetlag. And you know \nif use that link  again  we'll get a portion of your\nsubscription fee for life. And you'll actually also get\n$20 off an annual subscription. It's a great deal for you.\nAnd  yeah. So thank you in advance\nfor your support and good bye! Good bye!"

        "transcript": "Welcome back to episode six\nof our race across New Zealand. The country's a board game.\nWe do challenges to unlock routes. And right now \nall eyes are on Wellington. The first team to complete\nthe Wellington challenge will be able to take the first\nferry to the South Island  a full 2 hours and 45 minutes\nbefore the next ferry. That is  if the team\ncan get to the boat before noon  when boarding ends. Toby and I are\nslightly in the lead  but Ben and Adam are\nright on our tail hoping to shoot us\nwith a Nerf gun  which will freeze us\nfor 30 minutes  which would cause both\nteams to miss the ferry  putting everyone on the 3:45 ferry\nand tying up the game. The Wellington challenge \nby the way  is to run for Prime Minister\nby creating a campaign video  making promises at\nfour of the following nine notable Wellington locations. Already not easy \nbut especially difficult because Ben and Adam\nhit us with a curse that means that if\nwe use the letter E anytime in the next three hours  we have to freeze in place\nfor five minutes. Plan words? Plan... words. Good. Words...\nMmph. Okay  so looking at\nall of the locations Yeah.\nThat they might possibly go to... There are two that are\nright next to each other: the Wellington Museum\nand the Waterfront Walkway. They would have to be\ncrazy not to go there. Right. That's a really good idea.\nOkay. Make that our destination. I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous too. Park. They're in Wellington.\nThey're at the Beehive right now. They're already there? But presumably\nthey're at the Beehive  and they're trying\nto find a tie nearby. But it's okay. I mean \nwe're only 14 minutes... I guess we didn't specify\nyou had to buy a tie. They might have just found\nsomething they can use as a tie. It's true. Kia ora! I'm Toby \nrunning for top job. If I win that job  I'll construct many\ngood buildings... that you'll say wow about. Okay. Okay. I think they're\nback on the road. Really?\nYeah. Shoot  that was fast.\nThat was fast. Okay. I think put\non your disguise. Park  walking all. Fast. Faaast. I'll look at our old stuff and put it on display for all to look at\nand think about. Looks like they\nmight be going out to the Waterfront Walkway now. Seven minutes.\nSeven minutes  Ben...! (sustained wincing) Oh dear. Oh dear  oh dear \noh dear  oh dear. I don't know if we're gonna make it.\nI don't know if we're gonna make it. I'll build many amusing\nwalks along our bay. Come on! Here we go \ngreen light  green light. Oh  four minutes away. Four minutes. It's gonna be... nnngh! (pained grumble) No  red light  red light. No! Park... map. Okay  two minutes. Oh (bleep) You might have to\njust jump out  Ben. Fast  fast  fast. Now  now. I'll ban all Adams\nfrom Waitangi Park. Thank you  thank you  thank you. Woo...! Car. They're on this same street  like a block ahead. Okay  keep an\neye out for their car. We're so close  we're so close. Good. Gat. Gat.\nGat. What we're trying\nto say here is 'gate.' See  even though we've\nfilmed our four locations  this challenge is\nnot technically over until we pass through the\nchallenge gate on the highway just before the\nentrance to the ferry. At that point  the game\nwill essentially be paused. Basically a mini rest period \nexcept we're allowed to strategize until we reach the South Island. Okay. I think we're— That's them! That's them!\nThat's them. That's them  okay. That's them. That's them. That's them.\nOkay. Okay  okay  okay. Okay  hold on.\nThat's them. I'm gonna take off\nthe wig  so that we don't... they don't see that\nwe're in disguise. Okay. Okay. W–W–Wait. Jump out  jump out  jump out. No  no  they're in the car. (bleep) Okay  okay  okay.\nThey're in the car. Then we have to\nfollow behind them. Oh... no. Shh-sh-sh-shh. Good. D-O-N. I good. Okay  wait  wait  but... Wait  does that mean that they— Just keep following them.\nAre they done? Wait  but if they're\nleaving the waterfront  then that means that they might\nhave gotten to four already  and they're just going\nthrough the gate. I just— no  like... All we can do is follow them. Got. Okay  the game\nis now neutralized. It's basically treated\nby a rest period. So the curse is pushed until\nthe other end of the ferry. But...\nWhat a relief. Oh my god. Let's text them. Let 'em know that we officially\njust passed through the gate. Oh  they're not gonna like that. (sigh) So we missed 'em. So they're gonna\nmake the 1 pm ferry. Seemingly they're\ngonna make the 1 pm ferry  which means that\nwe're on the 3:45. One Nerf bullet and five coins. That was critical. And that was decided by... once again  seconds. We should have just\nenough time to make it. Let's see what they're\nthinking in the background. Not  not good. Not ideal. Shoot. Hi. Lane three. Thank you. I think that's our boat. Nice. The Kaiarahi. It's a big boat. Here we go. This ferry that\nwe won by 60 seconds. Alright. Well  we had a little lunch. Yeah. We're... stressed. Yeah  I'm pretty stressed. ...is how I would describe it. We're in trouble. Yeah  yeah. Much like Fleishman \nwe're in trouble. That's a great reference  Adam. Yeah  thank you. In a very similar\nway to Fleishman  that's the same way\nthat we are  which is that we're in trouble. Anybody watch\nFleishman [is] in Trouble? Any of our viewers\nbig Fleishman heads? Seems like we're leaving. Unfortunately  20 minutes late \nbut still a good margin. Okay  well... We are now two hours and\n45 minutes behind Sam and Toby  and we have five coins and\na bullet  so the question is... how do we win the game? A big question is just gonna be \nwhich way do they go? And we don't know yet. Okay  so we\nhave to decide now. Basically there's\none big west route and one big east route. When we reach the South Island  after completing the\nfirst challenge in Picton  teams will face arguably the\nbiggest decision point on the map: whether to go east or west. The west route is roughly\n10 hours and 20 minutes of driving to the next convergence\nwith eight challenges. But the challenges are \nat least theoretically  faster and more reliable. The east route has a few options \nbut all of them save roughly an hour and a half\nworth of driving compared with the west route. Plus  there are fewer challenges. The thing is  the challenges are \nat least theoretically  much harder and riskier. Christchurch could\ntake hours to complete  and catching a fish in\nKaikōura is a major gamble. Teams will have several\nchances to converge later  but this turn will be\none of the most impactful decisions of the game. We haven't\nspoke about it yet  but I have a big\npreference for one way. I wonder if you do as well. I don't have a strong preference.\nOh  I'll tell you mine. Mine is to go on the east. Okay.\nTo go that straight path. Because even looking\nat the challenges  like you mentioned \nthey're kind of risky. They're kind of difficult \nbut I think they're doable  and that's our favourite\nword for a challenge. I think so. In my opinion... the smart move for\nthem is to go west. The west route is longer. It actually has more challenges \nbut they're all easier. Which means that\nproportionally less time will be spent doing challenges \nand more time will be spent driving  which means that following\nbehind someone going west is not a very good plan  because... The driving time is the same. The only time you gain\nis the challenges  and the challenges\nare pretty short. Also because... the east route involves\ncatching a fish. Yeah.\nWhich... as this show\nhas shown many times  is much harder than you think.\nWe caught a fish. We caught a fish in\nthis part of the world. We did. We did. It's true that we did do that. But that was pretty fluky. I don't know if we\ncould do it again. I think I'm pro east route. It's just  I'm really\nworried about fishing. I'm worried\nabout fishing too. To be honest \nwhat I'd love to do is to skip fishing. The thing about\nskipping challenges is not only\ndo we get to skip it  but they still have to do it. Yeah. So... I think skipping the fish\nwould be so good for us. You know what I'm\njust realizing right now? What? They might go east\nand skip the fish. They're gonna skip\nthe fish  aren't they? They might skip the fish. I'm afraid that they\nmight skip the fish. It'd be a really smart move. It would be a really smart move  because it would\nput us in a position where we would have... no good options. (bleep) Let's hope they\ndon't skip the fish. We'll find out. We have a very\nlate ferry to go catch. Yep. And we wanna\nget there as early as possible. Adam  good news. Sea conditions today are light. We're some of the very\nfirst people to get on the ferry. This could be good. Again  maybe it'll take\nthem a really long time to get off the ferry.\nThat'll be huge for us. Then we'll score\nanother half hour. Yeah. Alright  so it looks\nlike we've docked in... Pickin'? Picton.\nPicton. So we have made it\nto the South Island. So we'll see when we get off. How the game restarts essentially  this kind of mini rest period... will end the second we\ndrive off of this boat. So at that point we will have\n35 minutes of curse continued  where we're not gonna talk. Technically  we can talk \nbut we're not gonna risk it. So all we have to do is\nour little boating challenge. Dock a boat in\nPicton Memorial Park. Construct a small boat\nout of any material. On the beach \nmark out a one-foot \"dock.\" Using only your breath \nguide the boat from a distance of 49 feet or 15 meters\nin the water into the dock. But we've made a plan for that. We've taken advantage\nof this non-curse time to make a bit of a plan. Here we go! That was a long wait \nbut we're finally moving. My last words are  we're gonna dock our boat faster\nthan they docked this boat  right? Mhm.\nYes. Because we couldn't talk then  I'm gonna walk you through\nwhat happened next in VO. To make our boat \nwe went to Hammer Hardware  where we bought two sponges\nto serve as a buoyant base. Then we headed over to\nPicton Memorial Park  where we built our boat using a paint swatch and a\npencil as a sail. Toby went out into the water\nand quickly determined that the boat was too big to be\nsteered by blowing on it. We switched to the\nsmaller sponge  tried it again  and it immediately sunk. So we tried the big\nsponge without the sail  which didn't work at all. At which point someone\nwalked up to us and asked... No. And proceeded to tell us that\nthere were stingrays in the water. Stingray. Stingray. We were already pretty sure\nthe challenge would take longer than the 60 minute veto period  and the stingray\nwas the last straw  so we were forced to decide. No do. Not right. V.\nV? O–Okay  V? Okay. Okay. So Ben and Adam's microphones\ngot messed up on the boat  which means good news:\nyou get more VO. While we waited out\nour veto period  they had a blast. They did a Snack Zone  hung out on the deck \nlooked at cool islands  and were shocked and\ndelighted when they realized that between docking \nchallenge time  and veto penalty  we've been stuck on Picton\nfor nearly two hours. They're getting really close.\nI don't like this. I saw that. That's why\nI started asking you about how long we have left. Yeah  I mean  I think we should be\nable to get outta here on time  but we're not gonna have\nbasically any margin. That really sucks. Their ferry's going so fast.\nI don't know how  but... Yeah  and ours was\ndelayed  theirs is early  and... We basically just eroded all\nof our Wellington advantage. See that ship in the distance? That's Ben and Adam. Oh no. 6:42. Let's go. Alright  well\nclose but not quite. They have now left. But Picton is right there.\nThat's Picton. I mean  Picton's\nright there  and they left... Looks like they're... I mean  six minutes out. Welcome to Picton \ngateway to the South Island. As the ship will been\nberthing shortly  those passengers with vehicles are asked to proceed\nto the vehicle deck and prepare to drive ashore. Let's go. Alright. We are getting\nto the official decision point. Are we going on the... I keep getting this\nwrong— east route? 100 percent?\n100 percent. A hundred percent? A hundred percent.\nWe aren't even talking about it. Let's lock it in. I mean  I feel like at this point  Ben and Adam are almost\ncertainly gonna follow us. I'd be very surprised if\nthey even the west route. It would be a bold play  and they might need to do\na bold play at this point. But I think given that the\ngap has reduced so much  It probably makes sense\nfor them to follow us  from their perspective. They've gone past... (sigh) East.\nHighway six. So yeah  it looks like\nthey're going east. East  okay. Well  I think that\nmeans we're going west. If they're going east  then they're gonna skip\nthe fish challenge. And if they're gonna\nskip the fish challenge... then that means\nwe have to do it. And I just think... Yeah. The odds of\nus pulling that off in enough time \nit's just too big a risk. We'd just hit more delays. We wouldn't be earning any coins. No. And the thing is... and I don't know if\nthey realize this. I think the west route\nis actually faster. Yeah.\nIt's longer  but the challenges\nare much easier. You don't have to deal\nwith Christchurch. Okay. Okay. West. We're going west. Hopefully by the\ntime they get off— It took us like a\ngood  I don't know  20–25 minutes to get off. I would guess that\nthey're gonna be quicker  'cause I think their\nboat was less busy. But still  hopefully it's \nyou know  good 10–15. I mean  these\npeople are moving. These people are moving.\nI'm feeling pretty good. I mean  look  this\nroom is emptying out in a matter of minutes. Yeah  show 'em. I mean  look \npeople are moving. I mean  it took them 40\nminutes to get off the ferry. But maybe there\nwas some weird delay. Maybe this is fast.\nYeah. Oh  here we go!\nHere we go  here we go. Yeah  I mean  look. That was not too bad at all. No  no.\nIt was not too bad. That was not too bad. I mean  now we're like  what? We're 45 minutes behind 'em. I mean  we thought it was\ngonna be so much worse than that. That is... good news.\nThat is pretty incredible. Alright  west route \nhere we come! So they just found out\nthat we're going the west route. We're not following them. I wonder if they\nwere expecting that. Okay  Toby. I have some interesting news. They're going west. No  they're not. No.\nThey're just kidding with us. No they're—\nThey've done the turn. They're coming back. That is interesting.\nThey're coming back. Well... It doesn't seem\nlike the right move  but it so doesn't seem\nlike the right move that it almost makes me wonder\nif it is the right move  and they're just smarter than us. I guess they're\ngonna try to win this with curses and stuff? I don't know\nwhere they're going  or what they're doing. Bold strategy. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus As you all know \nthe next episode of Jet Lag is up right now on Nebula  because every single\nepisode of Jet Lag is released one week\nearly on Nebula. But here's something\nyou might not know. Did you know that originally  this channel was not going to\nbe called Jet Lag: The Game? It was going to be called\nAmerica: The Game. Yee-haw. And actually our\ninternal Slack channel is still called\n\"America: The Game\" because we can't\nchange the name of it. The reason it was gonna be\ncalled America: The Game is that every game was\ngonna take place in America  because that's all we thought\nwe'd be able to afford to do. And then towards the end \nwe were like  we should change it\nto Jet Lag: The Game because that opens us up to do more stuff in different places\nif we could ever afford it. And it turned out we were\nable to do those seasons a lot sooner than we expected because so many of you\nsigned up on Nebula to support our show. And that's how we fund\nthis entire thing. What Nebula basically is  is it's a creator-founded and\ncreator-run streaming site. And creator-owned actually  too. Basically myself and a bunch\nof other creators got together  and we asked  you know  how do we make the best viewing\nexperience for our audience? And we had a few\ndifferent answers to that. You know  first of all \nyou know  easy answer. No ads  no sponsorships. It's a subscription-based service. So the revenue source is\nfrom the users themselves. Which cuts out kind of\nperverse incentives about  you know \njust optimizing for you know  purely for views rather than for how good\nthe videos themselves are. Then  you know \nwe did other stuff. Like we decided that  you know \nsome videos we'd upload early  like every single episode\nof Jet Lag. And then we also decided\nto do original content. We call them Nebula Originals. We basically use the revenue that\nwe generate from subscription fees to basically fund big\npassion projects by creators. What is the kind of thing\nthat they would want to do but never had the money\nor resources to make? And then we just make it\nand put it on Nebula. And so it's a lot of\ncreators' best work all on this platform \nwhich I think is so cool. And there's even more  I don't have time\nto go into it all. But in all  you know  Nebula is the best viewing\nexperience for Jet Lag. Because again  no sponsorships \nno ads  one week early. We haven't even mentioned\nThe Layover  the podcast. You know  the exclusive podcast\nthat we do every single week. Weekly podcasts! You know  reacting\nto a given episode. So it's the best viewing\nexperience for Jet Lag  and then it's the best\nviewing experience for all these\nother creators  too. Many of which  I mean \nwe actually know from our audience\ncrossover statistics. We know that many of these\ncreators you already watch. So  take a look. The best way to sign up\nis through our link  nebula.tv/jetlag. And you can get $20 off\nan annual subscription. By signing up that way \nyou're supporting the show. A part of your subscription\nfee will go to us for as long as you\nstay subscribed. So  that'll help support the show\nand keep everything running and help us fund bigger  more absurd\nseasons in the future. Yep  so... Episodes one week early.\nLayover podcast. Everything from other creators.\nHelps support us. nebula.tv/jetlag\nThank you for signing up! Good bye!"

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome\nto episode seven of our race across New Zealand. Last episode  my partner Toby\nand I got a massive advantage by earning tickets on the\n1 pm ferry to the South Island  forcing Ben and Adam\nto take the 3:45 ferry. But our good luck didn't last. Our ferry left late and\ntook a long time to dock  and then we couldn't\ncomplete our challenge and had to veto  all but eliminating\nour once massive lead. We're hoping to widen the gap by taking the much\nshorter eastern route  while Ben and Adam have\nmade the surprising decision to take the longer western route  banking on its challenges\nbeing easier than ours. Things are— things have\nimproved dramatically. Things have\ngotten a lot better. So here's the deal.\nWe're going on the west route. And the first challenge\non the west route is to get drunk on a local wine. Get drunk on local\nwine at the Wairau River. The Wairau Valley is\none of the most famous wine regions in New Zealand. Buy any New Zealand-made wine and get one team member\nlegally intoxicated with it at the Wairau River. After we get one\nteam member drunk on wine... Obviously only one\nperson will get drunk  and it'll be Ben \n'cause I have to drive. 20 minutes later  we both have\nto complete a Math Minute. Complete a Math Minute\nin Saint Arnaud. Both team members – including the one who\njust got drunk on wine – must successfully\ncomplete a Math Minute within a minute\nwith no mistakes. If either team member\nmakes any mistakes or does not finish in time  both team members must try again. We're gonna do our very best. I should study my math.\n(imitates percussion) In one kilometer  we're\ngonna take a slight left turn to stop and drink our cake\nin front of the pink lake. Drink cake at a pink lake. In front of Lake Grassmere  which often turns pink due to\nits high salt concentration  consume at least one third\nof a slice of cake using a straw. The cake may be in any form and may be mixed\nwith other things  so long as it is consumed. I'm excited actually\nabout seeing the pink lake. Yeah  although I just\ngot a view from the distance. It doesn't look\nsuper pink right now. Oh.\nUnfortunately. But I'm sure it is sometimes pink. A little bit of cream. Ooh. And stir. Oh yeah  see \nthese are vineyards. This is a wine-growing region.\nYep. That's the point\nof the challenge. I'm going to eat\nthe fermented that. You're gonna drink it. I'm gonna drink\nthe fermented that. Okay. Go to the median. Here we go. Alright. Any wine from New Zealand. Bay of Islands. Great. Thanks very much. Thank you. So they're currently\nat Lake Grassmere. They're— the challenge is\ndrink cake at a pink lake  which... Sam is gonna hate that one. It just rhymes.\nIt's just— only— that— It doesn't teach you\nanything about the lake or... It's just 'cause it rhymes. Alright  I think I've got\nit to the right consistency. Nice and viscous. Okay. This must be\nan American cuisine  'cause it sure ain't\nfrom around here. Oh yeah. This is... This is what I have for\nbreakfast every morning. This is harder than I thought. Every minute matters  Sam. What Toby's saying is true. Every minute counts. Even though the teams are on\nopposite sides of the South Island  we're still in a\ntightly contested race as we approach the finish. Ben and Adam went west \na longer driving route  banking on the idea\nthat our challenges will take longer than theirs. So to help you keep track\nof whether their plan is working  we're going to\nperiodically show you both teams' estimated driving time to Lookout Point \nour final destination  assuming both teams take\nthe shortest routes from their current points. Right now  we're an estimated 12 hours and 30 minutes\nof driving time away  compared to Ben and Adam's\n13 hours and 50 minutes. Basically  ignoring challenges  we've got an 80 minute lead. So  let's see if we can keep it. That's it. Alright  let's turn\naround and send it! I'm not sure whether\nI should turn around. Do you think I can— I think you can\njust do it here  yeah. Alright  we're getting\nvery close to Kaikōura. And to sleep.\nLooking forward to that. But we need to decide\nwhether or not we are skipping. So  we had basically decided  but then they went west. Do you still think it's worth it? I'm unfazed on\nthe skipping challenge  because I think it's just\nour best bet to save time. We're gonna have so many\ncoins going this way. Yeah. The boys aren't\ncompeting with us here. I think that\nthey're banking on us getting unlucky. They've gone that way\nhoping this will slow us down  but this ain't slowing us down. So I think it's the\nright move just to mitigate  just to minimize risk. So... should we do it? Send it. Alright  we are\nskipping Kaikōura fishing. So glad to not have to\ntry to catch or I guess touch a fish again.\nI'm relieved  yeah. My fishing experiences\non Jet Lag have not been\npositive in the past. Sam has informed\nus that he is skipping the fishing challenge \nwhich is... not a shocker. No. We had figured out\nhe was gonna do that. Unfortunately  the\nreason we figured out he was gonna do that is that\nit is very clearly the best move. Yeah. In response to us letting\nBen and Adam know that we were skipping Kaikōura  Ben said  \"Yes  we figured lol.\" What does that mean? What do they know that we don't\nabout the western route? I thought they would\nactually be kind of surprised. Yeah  I thought that they\nwere banking on us getting really slowed down  but... If they're not banking on this \nthen what are they banking on? Ben and Adam's mics cut\nout for a few minutes here  but because we skipped Kaikōura  it meant we were on one of the\nlongest empty stretches in the game  giving them the\nperfect opportunity to use their useless \nbut annoying curse. You must listen to Tom Lehrer's\n\"The Elements\" song on repeat until you reach\nyour next challenge. Toby  we have received\nsome somewhat fortunate  somewhat unfortunate news. We have to listen to the\nElements song by Tom Lehrer until our next challenge. And because we've\nblown past Kaikōura  that means we have to\nlisten to this song all the way until Christchurch.\nNo... no... This might impact our sanity  but this should not impact our... ...progression.\nSure. So it's a good thing\nfor our gameplay.

Alright  alright  nice! Alright  I feel like\nthat went really well. That was not bad at all. No  I mean \nwe were in and out in about ten minutes \nI think. Challenge complete. Now our next challenge is at the Motukiekie Beach Walk. Find a starfish on the\nMotukiekie Beach Walk. Find a real starfish \nliving or dead. It cannot be a\ndepiction of a starfish. If able  you must\ngo onto the beach. I would love\nto see a starfish. It is apparently very\ndifficult to access the beach during high tide. And I do think it's going to\nbe high tide when we're there. We found a blog that said that there's like a secret entrance\nthat you can take. So we're gonna look into that. Brrrr... You've gotta find what\nthose subtle indicators are that you can look at and know— Selfie. Thank you for visiting Antarctica in ten minutes. Alright  Botanic Gardens. It's a whole 16 minutes. That kind of sucks. Alright  so it looks like\nBen and Adam have already left the rock skipping challenge. I was expecting that to be\nharder  but I guess not. Pressure's on. Do you think there are\nany stingrays in there? Alright  parking\ntook way too long. There was not a single\nspot in that lot. We had to get a little creative. But we think it's fine \n'cause it's only for ten minutes. Alright  welcome to the gardens. Alright  11:13  ten minutes. Seems like a memorial. We're sneaking.\nOkay. One day  you'll\ngrow to be this big. Alright  plant selfie. Okay  it's 11:23. Let's go. Oh  it's gonna take forever\nto get out of the parking lot. Good news. They are still\nin Christchurch. Okay  that's really good. It's exactly what we want. I mean  longer is better  but... I mean  we  I will say... are breezing through\nthese challenges about as quick as we\nhad been hoping to. I'm hoping if we can find\na starfish quickly... I mean  we're gaining  I would say we are\ngaining on them. We're definitely\ngaining on them. Alright  coming up on the: ...I think. Alright  let's go. Can we have two adult tickets? Two adults? Yeah.\nNo worries. Yeah. Hi. Look at Hogwarts. Yeah  I used to have this. Planes! Oh  that's a\nlot of Hot Wheels. Oh  look  it's the Pez Museum. Ben  Adam. Yeah. Oh we gotta go  our time's up. This museum's too good. I know  I know  I know. I wish we could stay. It was such a good museum.\nIt was such a good museum. Air Force Museum of New Zealand. Oh  another 15 minutes.\nGeez  these routes. I mean  this is the\nquickest route  I did look. I didn't expect\nChristchurch to be this big. Oh  are they\nstill in Christchurch? Let's check where they are. I really hope that they are. That would be really awesome. Seemingly they are \nhave not left Christchurch. Really? Yeah. I mean they might  you know \nthey could leave any minute. But as of— That's current? As of right now \nthey are still in Christchurch. I mean  that's awesome. That means they've been\nthere for a really long time. I mean  things are going pretty\ngood for us so far today  Ben. Yeah. I don't wanna\nget ahead of myself. But things are going\npretty good right now. I'm pretty pleased. If we can find this starfish...\nIf we can find a starfish... That's the last big thing\non this route that I'm worried. That's like  I'm worried\nit's gonna be impossible. If it wasn't for\nthat damn curse card that they could pull\nat any moment that would force us\non a terrible route  I'd just be chillin'. Yeah  I would just be\nJ Chillin  you know. Curse Ben and Adam. Well  specifically  well \nwe could curse Ben and Adam  but metaphorically\ncurse Ben and Adam. We're at 30 coins now  which means we could buy\na curse if we wanted. I'm intrigued by the\nidea of buying a curse  but I want to have\nthe potential to do a challenge skip late in the game. I don't think we\nneed a curse right now  so I think we should\njust hold onto our coins. Yeah. Free entry. Nice. I love a big plane. (whispering) There's more planes. Plane with skis. What could be better? We've done it  Toby.\nOkay  we're in  we're in. We're safe for now. Safe for now.\nWe're safe for now. Ben and Adam are crafty. If there's any potential\nthat they could win  they're gonna identify it. They know what's up  yeah.\nYeah  they know what's up. (rapping)\nLet's go to the beach. Beach  let's go get away. They say what they gonna say. Have a drink  clink \nfound a Bud Light. Bad (bleep) like me\nis hard to come by. Ninki Minaj  Ninki Minjaj. What's that— it's a Vine. I don't know. Ninki Minjaj. Adam? Yeah?\nWelcome to the beach. Thanks buddy. There's even cows at the beach! There's cows everywhere\nin this dang country  buddy. Cows deserve\nto be at the beach. Every cow deserves a\nlittle trip to the beach. That's true. Every cow does\ndeserve a little beach trip. I'm sure they—\nEvery cow deserves to take a little trip to the beach. Do you think they like it? Yeah  I think they do. Good. I think they love it. Look at that. We really  really need\nto find a starfish fast. Is this the random pull off that they were talking about?\nMaybe. It could be. That turnoff looks kind\nof promising right there though. Okay. What is this?\nOkay  let's try this. What is this? No  no  no  no. No  no  no. Definitely not. I think we need to turn around\nand try that other one. Okay. Think just over here. And there is a—\nThat's a little path. There's a secret little path.\nLook  look! Okay  we're gonna try that.\nThat's a little path. This has gotta be it. Wait  wait  Ben  slow down a sec. Okay  so our\nnext challenge is... couldn't tell you where. Somewhere south of here. Isn't it Timaru? Maybe. Ride your snowboard at\nTimaru Skateboard Park. Modify your snowboard to\nhave at least four wheels  which may be obtained anywhere. Ride the snowboard down an incline\nat the Timaru Skateboard Park. You do not need to stay on\nthe snowboard the whole way  but the modified board\nmust remain intact. We gotta convert this bad boy  our snowboard  into a skateboard. We're carrying\nthis annoying thing around in the back seat.\nYeah. We're glad to get rid of it. So there's a massive\nhardware store here. So we're gonna stop there  and hopefully they\nhave some wheels that we can attach to it  and hopefully should\nbe pretty easy. This sounds like a bit of a\ncursed challenge in a way. Alright. We're looking for wheels\nto screw onto something. Do you know where that might be? Like small little\nskateboard type wheels. Oh yeah  come\nwith me  guys  yeah. This is for sure it. Nice  nice!\nWe found it  okay. Just be careful. Okay. Careful  careful. Hug the side. Great job. There's a rope. Seeing anything? No. I'm not seeing anything. Shoot. I think we might\nhave to veto this one. Shoot! Oh yeah  that's perfect.\nThank you. Thank you.\nYeah  no worries. Alright. What do you think? I think these guys would be good. Yeah.\nIt won't take that big a screw. Yeah  these\nlittle ones look good. Little rubber ones. Then we need to\nfind screws and... A screwdriver. Yeah  screwdriver for sure. I'm gonna look\naround the corner! Okay. So the problem is...\nit's high tide. At low tide \nI think there would be starfish washed up on the shore. Gonna go down there though \nand check on it. Gonna run while the wave forms. Whoa. Ha-ha! Yeah. No  this is a lost cause. Okay. Alright  we're gonna\nhave to veto for sure. Uh-oh! Ack! (bleep) (cackles weakly) Hi. Alright. Thank you. Thank you. No starfish? No  veto for sure. Okay  let's veto. Okay  veto. Veto clock starts now  one hour. This sucks. But it's so pretty \nit's kinda hard to be mad. Alright. Alright.\nWell  that... was quite bad. So at 1:26  we can\ncontinue on to Hokitika. Where the challenge is... Make your own\nHokitika Beach sign. Hokitika Beach is known\nfor its driftwood sign. Anywhere else on the beach \nconstruct your own upright sign – out of any forged wood –\nreading Hokitika. It must be at least one foot tall. After this is over  I mean \nthis could be a good place to get some sticks and stuff. Yeah  maybe. But obviously we can't do that until the veto period is done.\nNo. Okay  it is... 15 seconds until the\nveto period ends. I think... in five seconds  we are going to start\nforging sticks for Hokitika. 'Cause there are some\nsticks right over here. And let's go. Alright.\nAlright. So theoretically we need\n18 sticks to spell 'Hokitika.' We are trying to be\nvery good boys. We will only be picking up sticks that are dead \nthat are already on the ground. We will not be disturbing\nanything living. That's probably a foot. Some shorter ones for the\nconnective parts as well. Okay  I feel like this\nis probably enough. Let's put these sticks in Dan \nand let's go to Hokitika. I just need to make sure\nthese don't fly outta the car. I think I'm officially\nall outta bits. So I can't think of anything more interesting to\ndo while driving. There are trains at least. Do you have anything interesting? Not off the top of my head. Is this Hokitika? Maybe this is Hokitika. Welcome to... Hokitika. Now  we may or\nmay not need tape. I think we should get it. But I think\nwe should be safe  and we might need tape later  so it's not a huge\namount of wasted time. Okay. That looks good.\nYeah. Hi  just this. Alright  let's go. Alright \nhere's the actual sign. We're gonna go out\nonto the beach... make our own. Come on  buddy. To make the O... There we go.\nIt's standing up on its own. Hokitika. Let's go!\nOkay. Goodbye  real sign! Well  we need to buy an\negg for the next challenge. Egg drop at the\nlanding site of Guy Menzies. Visit the landing site\nof Guy Menzies  the first person to cross\nthe Tasman Sea by airplane. While there  create\na vessel for your egg and throw it at least\n10 feet in the air. It cannot crack once\nit hits the ground. You may bring material to\nthe site of the challenge  but you must construct your\nvessel at the landing site. Yeah  New World. Okay  thanks. Are they out of eggs? Aren't eggs not refrigerated\nin other countries? Oh. Eggs. Let's get fewer.\nNice  okay. That's what happened. They don't refrigerate them\nin other countries  Ben. That's why we couldn't find them. Transaction accepted.\nLet's go. First of all \nwe got the eggs in Hokitika. We also got some cotton balls. We have cups in the back and tape. So we kind of figure that we can\nkind of just cushion an egg with cotton balls and\nput it between some cups and... that should do the trick. Yes. So we will see you at the\nlanding site of Guy Menzies. So as you can see on the map  this is the moment when\nBen and Adam learned that we were going on the east route\ndown to Invercargill  and not taking the west route that would converge\nwith them earlier. Toby and I didn't say\nmuch about it on camera  because it was\nobviously the best move  but it wasn't particularly\ngood news for Ben and Adam  because  well  it was\nobviously the best move. This means that\nthere's no possibility we'll clear challenges for them\nuntil the very end of the game  which means there are\nvery few ways to catch up. Their only realistic\npath forward now is to go high risk  high reward \npull as many curses as possible  hoping to get the one they\nneed to even out the game. So  they have gone east. It means that there's\nno possibility that they'll be able to clear\nany challenges for us... until Invercargill  which is\nthe second to last one. So I think that... we should be buying curses. That we can afford one first. But after the egg drop \nwe'll be able to afford another. So  we're gonna just\nstart pulling curses  starting with... with one now.\nYeah. We really need it to be good. So  okay. I'm gonna pull it. You get no reward for\nyour next challenge. Okay  that's pretty good. Yeah. I mean \nwe'll just hang on to this and use it at the\nbest possible time. Welcome to Timaru. Home of the Timaru Skate Park slash snowboard\nused as sandboard modified into skateboard park. Oh my god  there are a\nbunch of scooter kids. This is terrifying. You've got some\ncompetition  Sam. Alright  this concrete\nis very hard. (chuckles) Oh... Okay  it didn't say\nI had to stand up. Alright  you ready?\nYou wanna go down there? Oh  that's your ramp? Yeah. I was waiting for\nyou to walk over there. I'm not going\ndown that on this! I'm not breaking myself. Okay  well it works. Hang on  are you sure\nwe can't find another one? I'm not going\ndown that on this! In the middle? That? I don't wanna get\nin all their way. You sure  it's just... Okay  let's try this one. Do you think he\ncan skate down that board on that little square down there? On that?\nYeah. It might be quite\nhard  but probably. Yeah  well \nI told him he can do it. Hey. This is steep! Okay. I think I'll pass that. Wait  is that a\nsnowboard with wheels? Yeah. It's  I made it\ninto a skateboard. Oh nice. It's a DIY skateboard.\nYeah  it works out well. I recommend it if\nyou ever want to try... you know  upgrade from that. Oh yeah. I do have\na skateboard at my house. Oh  yeah? Well  these\nguys are even bigger  so you know  better. Alright.\nAlright. See ya. I'm gonna reckon a guess\nand say that we're in the middle of a\nmontage sequence right now. It could be true. All of the rivers\nseem to be really dry. I don't know if that's normal\nor a really bad thing. I have no idea. Let us know if that's normal\nor a really bad thing. Alright  next stop  penguins! We've already seen penguins today.\nWe have. We're gonna\nsee more penguins. Hopefully. (stammers) I'm optimistic. Okay  here's the deal.\nWe're about eight minutes out from the landing\nsite of Guy Menzies  where we can do our challenge. They are also about 15 minutes from the next point where\nthey could take a turn. Now  obviously they really don't\nwant to take a turn up west  and they won't. But there is a curse where we could force\nthem to do that  and we'll be able\nto buy another curse after we do this thing. So what we need to do is do this egg drop\nin one minute. Buy a curse. And if it's the one that\nallows us to force a turn... Then...\nThey're (bleep)-ed. They would\nbe totally screwed. Yeah. Alright. We can learn all\nabout Guy Menzies. Alright  we gotta hurry \nhurry  hurry  hurry  hurry. Car. Where are the cotton balls? They're right\nthere in my seat. Okay  okay.\nLet's hurry  hurry  hurry. Guy Menz—\nYeah  Guy Menz-egg. Okay. Here we go. Okay. Okay  ready? One  two  three. I mean  that felt like nothing. If he survived \nthen we can buy a curse. Okay  okay. He survived  let's\nbuy a curse right now. Go  go  go  go  go  go  go.\nOkay. Okay  okay.\nHere  I got it  I got it. Okay  hold on. Okay  here we go.\nTop one. Top one. (gasp) OH MY GOD! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus We're back in it  baby. We're back in it.\nWoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! It's come down this close.\nI honestly don't know how. but Ben and Adam have had\nplenty of time to think of how. We need to be so quick. I'm gonna scroll Twitter. That'll reduce my anxiety  right? Well  that's better than\nscrolling around on the tracker. We barely pulled that one out. Barely made that one work. Our plan is\nabsolutely devilish. We will see. We'll see. We're still coming for you. We're not gonna stop. The Jet Lag season five\nfinale is available right now on Nebula. It's epic  it's amazing. And you know  it's actually\nnot what I expected. Toby and I were very chill\nat the end of day four  because we thought we\nhad this so in the bag  I actually took a nap\nin the car on that day. While Toby was driving. While Toby was\ndriving  to be clear. I remember there was one line\nthat I said that was like  \"Don't worry too\nmuch about filming. I'm pretty sure we're just\nin a montage sequence.\" 'Cause I thought that\nthere was gonna be so little drama at that point that we'd probably just be\nmontaging until the finish line. Clearly it didn't end up that way  'cause of that little\ncurse thrown our way. But you can find out exactly\nhow this all came to an end right now on Nebula. And there's even more that\nmakes Nebula worth it. Like for example?

Nebula has all\nkinds of other things. Exclusives from other creators. A lot of creators put\ntheir videos up early. It has our podcast and the\none week early episodes.

        "transcript": "Alright  welcome to the finale\nof our race across New Zealand! At the end of this episode  one of these two teams\nwill arrive here at Lookout Point in\nBluff  New Zealand and be declared the winner. But before we get there  our teams will have\na lot of distance to cover and challenges to complete. Last episode  Toby and I put ourselves\nsquarely in the lead  breezing through the\neast route challenges  while Ben and Adam\ngot stuck in the west. But at the very last moment  Ben and Adam pulled the one curse\nthat would be able to save them  allowing them to redirect us onto a route straight\ntowards them  slowing us down massively  and setting us up to clear\ntheir path to the finish line. Okay.\nHere we go. Top one.\nTop one. OH MY GOD! Yeeeees!\nNo— Wait  wait  wait. Tell them \ntell them  tell them! Holy (bleep)!\nHoly (bleep)! Okay  okay  okay.\nCall them. Call them. They haven't passed\nyet  have they? Oh my god  oh my god. Okay  call 'em \ncall 'em  call 'em. I'm calling \nI'm calling  I'm calling. It's not going through. You call 'em on your phone.\nCall 'em on your phone. Okay  wait  wait.\nWhoa  wait  wait  wait. I'm jittery. I'm jittery. (loud  shaky huffing) Stop. Okay. Is it ringing? No  I'm literally shaking. Okay  we need to go\nto where there's service. Come on  get in the car. Oh my god  oh my god \noh my god  oh my god. I'm gonna keep trying\nto call them. Oh my god  oh my god \noh my god  oh my god. I cannot believe\nthat that happened. That's gonna seem fake! We're gonna have a\nlot of explaining to do. Ben  it's gonna seem fake! We're gonna have a\nlot of explaining to do. Hello? Hello? Did you get through? Sam? Turn right  turn right.\nYou've been cursed. We get to choose your next route  and you have to go to\nthe Elephant Rocks route. Okay  understood. We just got a call from Adam telling us to urgently turn\nright at the next road  and that he's sending us\nto the Elephant Rocks  because we've been cursed. Yep. Yeah  one would assume that\nwe can go to the Elephant Rocks  come back on this\nroad we were doing  and then resume. I don't think so. I think we have to continue on. You mean go up there?\nYeah. But that would be a massive... change to our plan. Yeah  it would be. That means if we have\nto go all the way up there  then we have to go through\nQueenstown and everything. With this diversion \nwe've gotta take the two and a half hour\ndrive over to Wānaka  where we'll converge with\nBen and Adam's route. From there \nwe can continue south  but we'll be clearing some major\nchallenges that were in their way  giving them ample time\nto catch up. Okay!\nYeah— (hyperventilates) (cackles) We were a little worried\nthat it wouldn't go through. But they got it. They got it. They have to take the turn. We literally\ngot that within— It was five or ten\nminutes before the turn. I just... I'm so afraid that people\nwill think that it's staged. We did not stage that! We did not stage it. I mean... You could see a— You could see Ben shaking. I mean  if you don't— If—\nAnd we also— We aren't that good at acting. Look at Ben's hands in the shot. Look at how he is (bleep) shaking! Oh... my... god. We're back in it  baby. We're back in it.\nWoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I'm a bit upset to have\nour plan thrown like this. We're gonna have\npretty mountains. It'll be fine. I was disappointed that we\nwouldn't see the mountains. It might be fine. It'll be fine.\nIt might be fine. They are definitely\ngonna get to Wānaka first. Not by a lot \nbut just enough time that I think we're gonna catch up\nto them in Queenstown. And then it's gonna be close. Alright. Back in crunch time. Let's... Let's be quick  but also\nlet's focus on accuracy. Yeah  I think these rocks. Remember the Elephant Rocks. Assign ten rocks different numbers. Then  using a randomizer  put those numbers\nin a random order. One team member must\nthen memorize the order and touch the rocks\nin the correct order  with the other team\nmember verifying. If the first team member\ngets the order incorrect  you must pause for 15 minutes\nand then try again. One. Two. Three  four  five  six. Seven for the tiny one. Eight  nine. Ten for the small one. Oh  we have zeros.\nWe didn't assign a zero. Oh  I guess that makes sense.\nWhy don't we just replace them all Yeah  yeah. Okay  yeah.\nfrom zero to nine? So 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7. Seven  eight  and nine \nfinishing  yeah. Ready? Yeah  gimme the string. Yeah  I can see the string.\nI'm allowed to know the string. Yeah. So what I would recommend\nis visualizing your path. 2-4-6-0-5... Adam  I have no idea\nwhere we are right now. I know where we are. Where are we? We're in\nThe Snack Zone  baby! We're in The Snack Zone! Welcome to The Snack Zone.\nIt's a show within a show where we review New Zealand's\nworst and best foods. And maybe their most iconic. We actually don't really know. Today we're gonna\nbe reviewing Weet-Bix. This very busted up\nbox of Weet-Bix that we've been traveling\nwith this entire time  but have not eaten from yet. Weet-Bix is\nlike Wheat Thins  but if they were thick. I mean it pretty much\ntastes like nothing. You'll never guess\nwhat's happening  Ben. What's happening? We're stuck behind\nanother slow camper van. Yaaay! It'd be really awesome\nif you were a friend and let me pass. I would sing you a song! I would sing you a song\nif you let me pass! (whispering) Five  two... (whispering) 5-2-4 \n6-0-5  0-3-4  8. Five. Two. (softly) 524-605-0348. Four. Six. He's just chosen\nto go down to... Oh  yeah  yeah  yeah. Yes  yes  yes! (in deep drawl)\n♪ Thank you for bein' a friend ♪ ♪ A-travel down the\nroad and back again ♪ ♪ Your heart is true ♪ ♪ You're a pal 'cause\nyou let me pass ♪ Alright  you ready for the good part?\nI'm about to give it to him. (belting)\n♪ And if you throw a party ♪ ♪ and invited everyone\nyou knew-hoo ♪ ♪ Well  you would see ♪ ♪ the biggest gift will be from me ♪ ♪ and the card attached would say ♪ ♪ thank you for letting me pass ♪ Everyone in this little town\nis looking at you. Yeah. (muttering)\n605-0348. 0348. Five. Oh. Three. Four. Eight. Nice job. Turns out that\nwas a running challenge  not a memorisation challenge. Yep. Okay  we are headed\nthrough Franz Josef. And I think that we might be able\nto see the Franz Josef Glacier if we look really closely. Okay  check them out. Check out the cool glaciers. May or may not be a glacier. They may or may not\nbe glaciers. We don't know. But there are glaciers\nright around here. So that's cool. There's a big dam down here. Dam. Okay  so I've done\nresearch for Queenstown. 'Cause the challenge\nin Queenstown is about you've either gotta skydive \nbungee jump  or do one of the giant swings. So... here's the challenge. We're  I think  backed\ninto a bit of a corner. The problem is that as of now  including the stops for doing\n#ThatWanakaTree... Wānaka Tree and Bra Fence.\nYeah  and Bra Fence. We should get into Queenstown\naround 8:45 – 8:50 pm. So just before the rest period. And tomorrow morning... the earliest possible available of any of these is 9 am. The game starts at 8 am. So the earliest we could\nbungee jump was 9 am. And that company \nthey say to leave an hour and a half\nfor the actual jump  between the time it takes to \nyou know  go through the safety stuff  strap up  jump \ngo back up  and all that. So that means that\nwould effectively be two and a half hours\nto do that challenge  which would give Ben and Adam\nplenty of time to catch up and Nerf gun us. The alternative is that... we should have the budget going into Queenstown to skip it. That would force Ben\nand Adam to do it. Yeah.\nIt would probably take them an hour and a half hopefully. Plus driving time and all that. Logistics time  et cetera. And I think that would build us\nenough margin to do the challenge in Invercargill.\nYeah. And I'm not as\nconvinced as you are that that challenge is impossible. Yeah  I was thinking \n\"Oh  we have to skip it.\" It's catching a Nerf bullet\nin your teeth. I thought \n\"What  that's impossible.\" But maybe? With enough time. We would be able to do\nhundreds of attempts. But that makes me think that the best move is gonna be skipping Queenstown. In order to do that  we need to be sure\nthat we can get at least five upvotes on\n#ThatWanakaTree. Create content at\nThat Wānaka Tree. You must spend 30 minutes\ncreating the most obnoxious tumblr-ified picture\nof #ThatWanakaTree that you possibly can \nthen post it on Reddit. It should include\nat least one quote and ought to have gone\nthrough multiple filters. You receive one coin\nfor every upvote you get in the first 10 minutes \nup to 20 coins. To add to our five points that\nwe'll get from the Bra Fence to get to 100 coins. 'Cause right now we're at 90. I think that this is our\nbest path to victory. It's much narrower than\nI would want it to be. In fact  it is crazy narrow\nfor the fact that we were almost three hours\nahead on driving time. Sam was napping in the car\non the way to the skate park. Yeah  I was napping.\nHe was so comfortable. Because my\nanxiety was so down. But it is... (click)\nback up again. Mountains...! Love some good mountains. Okay  we are nearly\nto our next challenge. Tell 'em what the\nnext challenge is  Ben. Identify 10 plants\nat Knights Point Lookout. This region of New Zealand\nis known for its diversity of plant life. Using iNaturalist or any\nother plant-identifying app  successfully identify at least\n10 different types of plants. Any successful identification\nthe app provides  regardless of how general  counts. One little hiccup... is that we don't have service and haven't had service\nfor about 10 minutes. So if we get there \nand there's no service  then the app won't work. And we'll have to veto it. Yeah  that would be bad. Augh. Alright  seven kilometers. Still no service. Not good.\nNot good. Alright  we're getting\nclose to #ThatWanakaTree. Remember  our\n30 minute timer starts when we get\nin front of the tree. So we gotta make sure that we  you know  go once we get there and not waste any time. Every minute matters  right? Sorry  #EveryMinuteMatters. Alright.\nAlright  alright  alright! We're back  service is back. We're five minutes away.\nWe have service. Thank god! Woo! Whew! Ohh!\nOkay. That's good  that's good. That is really good. So even if there's\nnot service there  we can always just\ndrive backwards. Yeah.\nAfter we take the pictures. Just a couple of minutes. Oh  Ben! Pretty. Welcome to\nKnights Point Lookout. There is not a soul here. Let's go see the lookout quickly. There we go. #ThatWanakaTree. Isn't it worthy\nof tumblr-ification? Point to the tree? That Wānaka tree. The one with the people. Are you still wondering\nwhich one it is? I have no idea what\nyou're talking about. That one?\nThat Wānaka tree. The one sticking\nout in the water? Yeah! The one with\nall the people around it. That small  scrawny\nlittle tree right there? Well  it's very pretty. Look at that. Very pretty. Alright  okay.\nLet's start taking pictures. Down for the closeup? It's gotta be as\naesthetic as possible. Let's just get a lot. Debating. Good. Okay. Nice. Shoot these. Get these. Okay  I think that's good. The mountain's in the background. What do you think? I like it now. That's actually a\npretty nice photo. Colours are great. Time to ruin them\nwith some filters. That's probably enough. That's at least 20  right? To do these.\nOkay  let's go. Let's hope for the best. Okay. We're just driving\nbackwards now until we can... find any service. It should be easy. I mean... Wait  what's that? Is that saying that there's\nservice in 700 meters? I think it's saying that\nthere's service in 700 meters. That's really weird.\nIs there— Is that a thing? It's like  oh there's a spot. Yeah. Yeah  it just popped up.\nMaybe? Oh  nice  nice.\nOkay  start going. I'm gonna start\nuploading them. Increase the\nsaturation by quite a lot. Sharpen all the way. Okay  well  I'm\ngonna add some text then. Inspirational quote style? Inspirational quote style.\nHere we go. Do you have an\ninspirational quote? Yeah.\nOkay. I have one. Well  I have one too. No  it just keeps saying... \"Can't identify.\" Wait  really? No. Should we post that? Okay  I'm on\nr/wendoverproductions. Is that where you wanted to go?\nI think so. We're posting it anonymously to not spoil the season and as ethical influencers  right? It's there  it's there.\nIt's got two  it's got two. One of them is presumably mine  and I hope the second isn't yours. We just need three. Three more. Three more.\nAnd then we're good. Okay  well that's one. Chain fern. Okay wait  so let me show. Okay  that's one. Chain fern. Sunflowers  daisies. Astrids and allies  okay. Can't identify. Can't identify. Grasses.\nGrasses. Clovers.\nClovers  okay. Nope. Nope. Let's go back to the car. I'm just refreshing\nthe Reddit page. Looking for upvotes  but... Yep.\nNo more yet. Toby  what if you used your\nanonymous Discord account to drop the link in the Discord? Oh  that's brilliant. Do it quick. (bleep) They're really\nkilling me here. These have gotta be... Okay  nice. Irises. Give me something new. That's a really\ndistinct picture. That's gotta work. Nice. Six. Seven. Eight. Yeah? Yeah  yeah.\nYeah? Nine?\nThat's a new one. Come on. Come on. Ten! Ten!\nTen. Yay!\nYes! Yes. Ohh. Oh my gosh  incredible.\nOh  whew. Okay  we barely\npulled that one off. Barely made that one work. I'm feeling pretty good.\nPretty good. Pretty  pretty good. Pretty good. Any response? Silence. What? I've never got less\nengagement on a post before. Just say something like  they just posted from... I put the eyes\nemoji and the link. It's time  we're free. So we've cleared the challenge \nbut the question is  did we get the five upvotes\nwe'll need to skip Queenstown? We haven't done it. We only have three.\nIt went down from four. I said ask your\nfive closest friends. (scoffs) I didn't have time. Is it ten minutes? Yeah. It's been ten minutes. Damn. Wait  wait  wait  wait. We're gonna lose the game\nbecause of two uplikes? Maybe? Say what? I don't know. Ohh  alright. We're continuing on now. That was really\nnerve-wracking. That was scary. That was a little scarier\nthan I thought it would be. But we're moving on... to Haast. Complete a Haast Pass. With you and your teammates\nboth standing on dry land  throw a rugby ball\nacross the Haast River. Your teammate must\ncatch the ball. You may split this\ninto multiple passes  so long as you ultimately cross the entirety of one river width. It's a little pun for you.\nIt's a little pun. Hopefully that won't be too hard. It's a big river... but it has— it's split up a lot. And we can do it in multiple\nthrows if we need to. We just need to get the\nball across the river. Okay. Off to Haast. Yeah  Toby  I don't\nsee any way around it. I think we're gonna have to\nbungee jump in the morning. It's the middle of the night in the places that most\nof our audiences are. But there's heaps\nof Kiwi fans of Jet Lag. No  I don't buy it.\nThey're not active. Not active on the Discord. It was barely any movement. We got three upvotes and\none downvote seemingly. (heavy sigh) So... Okay  so this is the Haast River. So already I'm seeing.... places where we could\nprobably do this. A hundred percent. So it has to go\ndry land to dry land. Yep. So this is\nprobably too wide. I think that there's\ndefinitely an opportunity right over there. You think? I can't really look right now. But if you feel\ngood about it here  then I say we do it here. I mean  I'm seeing lots of spots where it would\nprobably be possible. Okay  great. Alright. We're going down the\nangler access path  but we have no angling to do. Not any angling at all. Is there any river? Yes  it's just\nfurther up here. Sure is pretty though. It's very beautiful. All these rocks are nice. Comment below what\nyour favorite rock is. I feel like you\ncan do a little jog  or are you kind of beat? Well  I mostly think\nI'm gonna twist my ankle if I do that.\nOkay  fair enough  let's walk. It'll be really tight  whether\nor not they can make it before we finish bungee jumping. I don't believe\nwe have 90  what  98 coins or something? 98  yeah. I can't believe it.\nWe needed 100. Sucks. And you know— We would've\njust won the game right there with 100 coins. The only person to\nblame is the audience! This is  we've\ngot the bra fence. How many coins is... That's five.\nThat gives us the 98  right? Yeah.\nYeah. Find ten green bras\non the Cardrona Bra Fence. Any shade of green\nor near green counts. Okay  so let's quickly  quickly \nquickly  quickly  quickly find 10 green bras. How far do you think\nyou can throw a rugby ball? I have no idea. Maybe we should test\nthat before we attempt. If we do lose the ball  we will have to veto\nthe challenge  'cause— And we'll also\nbe in huge trouble  'cause we'll have put a rugby ball into a beautiful river\nin this lovely country. Okay. This is not a\nhospitable landscape. No. This is taking a bit\nlonger than I thought. We're having to do a lot\nmore walking than expected. Okay  well  I can... ford this... river.\nOkay. It's a very slimy river. Okay  that's cool. Alright  here we go. Part one of the Haast Pass. I'm on land. Ben is on land. Here we go  you ready? I'm ready. Oh! Oh god. Okay. One.\nOne. Two. I think that's—\nMm  what do you think? Is that green?\nThat's green  yeah. Yeah  that's green. Two.\nThat's actually green. Three.\nThree. This is green. Four.\nThat's green  right? Yep. This is dark green. Five. Go ahead and toss it back. Okay. Well... we succeeded in doing\nthat  but wrong way. We did it backwards  yep. Okay  here we go.\nYou got it. Nope. Alright— Maybe you\nshould try and catch. Okay  okay  let's switch. Amazing. Alright  that's one\npart of the river crossed. Let's go over there. This sucks without shoes. Still stuck without shoes. Six.\nDid you get this one? Six. If you're going ahead of me \nI don't know which ones you got. Seven. Okay  here's an eight. That's definitely—\nThis is one. Nine  yeah. Here's a 10. Well  here's\nan 11 back here too. Alright. 11 for bonus points. Alright  let's get in the car. Err so far on the side\nof throwing it further. Alright  careful\nin this river too. No. No  I don't feel good about that. Okay. We need to\nwalk further down. Okay. We'll get there.\nOh  mother-(bleep) Alright. Didn't end quite\nas well as I hoped  but I still think we're alright as long as we can\nget out of Queenstown ahead of Ben and Adam. Go extreme in Queenstown. In Queenstown  one team member\nmust do one of the following: go bungee jumping \ngo sky diving  or do a giant swing. You're booking a bungee\njumping ticket for one  right? Just you?\nFor one. I mean  unless you want to join. I've never been bungee jumping. Sounds a little bit terrifying. I mean  I was ready to do it in\nSingapore a couple seasons ago until the boys got to it first. But yeah  this one's bigger. And... it seems a little terrifying. And everything that Ben\nand Adam ever said about it since then is like  \"It was way more terrifying\nthan we thought.\" It's so— I— It's like walking across Legos. No. It's just those rapids. That's too risky. Okay. It's too risky barefoot. I don't know what else to do. What's the veto\nperiod on this one? I don't know. Part of my worry is\nthat you won't be able to move to catch the ball \n'cause the rocks are... You won't be able\nto pop over and catch it. Is there more\nriver over there or are we done after this? I think there's more. I think there is more. Maybe we should veto. It's not working here. Yeah. Okay  what do we do? I think we need to decide now. I mean  I think... If we can't even get past this Right  right.\npart of the river... The part of the river\nover there is even thicker. Right  and I don't think\nit's gonna be a thing where... there's the same volume\nof water at any point. Right  so it's\ngonna be the same. So I think it's gonna\njust be like this everywhere. And this looked easy to me  but it is way harder\nthan I thought. Yeah. Also  'cause\nit hurts so much. This sucks so bad.\nThe rocks? Okay  I think we\ngotta veto right now. Okay  yeah \nlet's just veto it. Oh Jesus. I know. How far could we\nhave thrown it? Let's see. I hit Dan. Well  I'm saying even that... Might have been in the river.\nWould've gone in the water. You know what I mean? Yeah. 8:59. Rest period starts... right now. Okay  that was our spot. Alright. Good night!\nG'night. My feet are so\n(bleep)-ed up right now. I know  I know. The veto period\nends tomorrow morning  and then we can continue on to... Wānaka. I still think we\ncan catch up to them. They'll get delayed\nin Queenstown. Our hope is just\nthat Queenstown is gonna take them long enough that\nwe'll have time to catch up. And then it'll be\nneck and neck  and... we'll have a chance to win. That sucks though. That sucks.\nThat's very disappointing. Well  we'll see\nyou tomorrow morning. (blows kisses) Oh  8 am  back at it.\nLet's go. Hello and welcome\nto the final day of this crazy adventure. Okie-dokie. It's 8 am. We are still here at the big dried up river. But not that dried up.\nNot dried up enough. Not dried up enough. Okay  we can leave in \nI think it's 12 minutes. 12 minutes. They are about 25 minutes\nout of Queenstown. And while we are stuck here \nwhich does suck  we can take some solace in\nthe fact that we are about to hit them with a curse\nthat they really don't want  which is that they are not\ngoing to get any reward for their next challenge \nwhich is— They would be getting\n40 coins from Queenstown. Yeah. I also think they're\ngonna be relying— I think that they are saving\nup to skip Invercargill. And based on our math  that means that they will not\nbe able to drop any roadblocks. Yep.\nWhich means that we can straight up just\nfollow behind them. And I think as long as Queenstown\ntakes them a little while  which I think it will... I'm pretty sure we can catch\nup to them by Invercargill. Adam  I have\na question for you. Yeah. Did you also\ndiscover a lot of shards of rock in\nyour foot last night? No.\nI did. Oh  Ben. I have some advice for\nthose of you who are planning on crossing\nthe Haast River barefoot. Don't do it. Nope.\nIt's a bad idea. Oh  buddy  I'm so\nsorry about your feet. No  I got all the rocks out. How are you feeling about\nyour imminent bungee jump? Honestly  not\neven thinking about it. 3Not even thinking about it. I'm too focused on the game. I'm a little worried that\nthey're gonna have some  you know  some crafty power— some crafty curse they\ncan do to steal our coins or block us from\nearning coins from this. So I'm actually a little bit now\nin the mind of playing it safe and not roadblocking \ngiven that margin  and saving that budget\nfor later. You know  use this margin that\nwe have to go bungee jumping  then get that budget hopefully. And then after that we'll\nbe safe to  you know  use this. Let's not speculatively\nspend budget. Yep  alright. There's some places\nwe can do it later. Check out these views. Oh yeah. Let's go. So officially \nI think Ben and Adam will now know that we are\nnot skipping Queenstown as they might suspect we could  and maybe would've if\nReddit was nicer to us. They're nearly to Queenstown. I think now is the\ntime to hit 'em. Now let's hit 'em. With this curse. This is... It's gonna hoit. Yeah  that's gonna\nbe brutal for them. Alright  I will let them know. Just got a text. It looks like it might\nbe a curse coming through. Ah  that's not a good one. You get no reward for\nyour next challenge. Well  I sure am\nglad we didn't do the... Yeah.\nIt's fine  ultimately. It'll make things harder  but... the plan is still intact. The thing I really didn't want was the curse that they would get\nour reward for the next challenge. Yeah.\nSo... that's not great  but I think the plan\nis still intact. Alright  we made it\nto the Bungy Centre. Ben and Adam  we're still fine.\nWe're back in control. We're so fine.\nWe're back in control. We will see. We'll see. We're still coming for you. We're not gonna stop. As long as they're\ndoing a challenge and we're driving \nwe're catching up. So right now \nif they're in Queenstown  getting ready to\ngo bungee jumping  or you know  the giant swing... we are driving. Yep. So we are\ngaining ground on them  'cause we won't have to do that. Yep. Ohh. Alright  we're just\nwaiting around for the bungee jumping center to open. I'm gonna try to be first in  so hopefully I'm gonna\nbe the first one to jump. I don't love being\nthe first one to jump  being the guinea pig for the day \nbut it's what's needed. So  hopefully this can\nbe relatively quick. Ah  it's fine. Are they on that bridge? Oh yeah  yeah  yeah.\nOkay  it just  yeah. The Kawarau Bridge. Yeah. So Sam hopefully is\nlike  you know... He has to get on his harness. He has to get all set up. You know  there's hopefully\na lot of sort of like... administration\nannoyance to deal with. Hope— Maybe he gets scared. He's gotta wait.\nHe's too scared. That would be great. Are you too scared? Well  we've been without\nreception for quite a while now. So hopefully right now \nthey're still in Queenstown having a spot of trouble. It's not her yet.\nIt's not her yet. 'Cause she's signing\nup to the side. Okay. She's got that wait. Sam's really taking\none for the team here. I was scared just watching him. I was shaking. Sam  you did amazing! Thank you. That was something. What I liked is  9:14. That was efficient. They're still... Oh wait. If they've left \nwe're totally (bleep)-ed. They've left the Bungy Centre  which doesn't make me feel good. No. But maybe... No  I'd say that\nmakes me feel quite bad. Just gonna have to see. Not good  Ben. Not good. Not good  Ben. Were you shaking up there\non the bridge? No  not really. Again it's like  focus your\nfocus away from the scary thing. Yeah?\nAnd it's fine. Focus just on victory \nand it shall be. Exactly  exactly. That's what I was thinking about. Okay  so now we need to get... Supplies.\nSupplies  yes. With Queenstown out of the way  here's what the map looks like\non the way to the finish line. One route goes through\nthe Fruitlands. It's pretty long \nthree hours and 19 minutes  but it only has one\nsimple challenge. The other route is only\ntwo hours and 50 minutes  but the challenge \nwhere you have to devil an egg at the Devil's Staircase \nis a little riskier. For teams that need\na real Hail Mary  this route also has\na potential shortcut that can be unlocked by\ncompleting a challenge in Lumsden. But if they fail it  then they're going\naround the long way. I'm feeling more and\nmore optimistic  but... It's not over\ntill it's over again. Do you wanna\nfilm in the shop? Yeah  just a little bit. Yeah  yeah.\nOh  do I want to? Yeah.\nI mean  I can. I hate filming in the shop. Excuse me. Where do\nyou have your eggs? That's everything  right? Yep  mayo  mustard  eggs. It should be easy  right? Don't say that!\nDon't say anything like that. That's okay.\nI don't have to be optimistic. You're gonna jinx— No  it's jinxing it!\nThe cheese was easy. It's not jinxing it.\nYes it is! All we have to do is Don't  don't  don't  don't.\nboil an egg. I think our best outcome is they clear deviled\neggs for us  right? Yeah. But then they'd\nfail at the shortcut and have to go the long way \nand in that time  I think we could\nmake it to the shortcut. And if we complete\nthe shortcut  right? Yeah. Then I think... Then we could gain ground. Then we could\ngain ground on them. Vieeeews! We'll have quite the\naudience for our deviled eggs. There's the Devil's\nStaircase down there. Fire! I gotta look for the spoon. Unfortunately we're gonna\nhave some cheesy eggs  'cause our bowl is looking\na little less for wear from the cheese challenge. Just one or maybe— No  no  we want\nat least a few in case we screw up peeling it. They're at the\nDevil's Staircase  deviling an egg. (sigh) Okay. I could see that taking a while. Yeah  I mean  we're\nabout an hour behind them. Yeah  I don't think we'll\ncatch up to them there. I think a lot of this\nis gonna come down to whether or not they manage\nto get that shortcut. Yeah. If they don't manage\nto get the shortcut  we could get the shortcut \nand that might be enough combined with the\ndeviled eggs to catch us up. Yep. I agree. Do you like deviled eggs? Hate deviled eggs. Hate deviled eggs.\nHate 'em. I can't say I've\nhad a deviled egg. You've never\nhad a deviled egg? No.\nHuh. I mean  I'm not in\na lot of scenarios where deviled eggs\nare offered to me. Fair enough  I guess. I'm gonna scroll Twitter. That'll reduce my anxiety  right? Well  that's better than\nscrolling around on the tracker. Should we give it a look? Yeah  alright. Do you wanna fish\none out with... dare I say it \nthis mustard spoon? Delicious. Wow  look at that.\nI'm gonna show the camera. Look at this. Looks amazing.\nDelicious. Take the yolk out. Look  I'm gonna mush up the\nmustard  mayo  and egg yolk. There we go.\nThat is a devil's egg. Ah. There we go. How is it? Tastes alright  you know? It's not that bad. Alright  you know\nwhat's gonna taste better? Victory.\nSo let's go. They have departed. (bleep) They've deviled an egg \nand they've departed. How far out are they? Looks like maybe... 10 minutes. Yep. They deviled\nthe egg pretty quick. Okay. We'll just see. Up ahead of us in\nthe road is an elbow. One final route selection. Yeah  we can decide\nto do this challenge to unlock  you know \nwhere we have to run down a road with a macaroni. Carrying a macaroni\nbetween our elbows. Yeah  but take time to get the macaroni\nand then do the challenge. And if we fail it \nwe only get one shot. It's extremely high risk. We have to double back\nso it doesn't seem worth it. Basically we're gonna go\nthe slightly longer route  and it's a clear road all\nthe way down to Invercargill. Yeah  so that's\nin the town of Lumsden  and apparently it used\nto be called The Elbow. Yep. And that's how we create\nour challenges. It looks like as soon\nas they got to Lumsden  they just took the long way. Okay  so that means\nthat they're not even attempting the shortcut. No  it seems like they\ndidn't even attempt it. Which I would say is\noverall good news for us  because it means if we\npull off that challenge  we will get enough\nmoney for a curse  and we will save\nabout a half an hour. And those two things\ncombined might be enough. It's a really\ngood opportunity. Yeah  it's like... I would argue it's\nour last opportunity. I would say that\nif we fail this challenge  the game's over. I would say that\nif we succeed at it  that we're still in play. Oh... dear.\nSo no pressure on us. I know it looks\nreally good for us  but in my mind it's still like\nwe could lose at any moment. It's come down this close.\nI honestly don't know how  but Ben and Adam have had\nplenty of time to think of how. So  hopefully we're right. Hopefully this is a clear path\nall the way down to Bluff. I'm so nervous. Me too. Okay  here we go. Welcome to Lumsden. Transport a box\nof elbow macaroni down Elbow Lane\nwith your elbows. Holding a box of elbow\nmacaroni between you and your partner's elbows  run down Elbow Lane\nin under 30 seconds. If you do not make it in\ntime  or drop the box  the challenge has\nfailed and cannot be re-attempted by your team. We need to be so quick. Let's find\nthat elbow macaroni. Ben and Adam lost audio\nwhile filming the elbow challenge  but I'll just let the\nfootage speak for itself. And with that final defeat  Ben and Adam were\ndecidedly out of the game. They're moving\nthrough Lumsden  and it looks like they're\nfollowing the path that we took  which would seem to imply\nthey didn't pass macaroni. Oh no!\nIf they attempted it. They're headed out to the east? They're not heading straight down.\nThey're heading to the east. I don't know if  given\nhow long they were there  I don't know if they attempted it. But they're certainly moving\naway on the longer path. Sorry  Ben and Adam. Currently still\n50 minutes behind us. They must feel so sad. ♪ The driver doesn't worry ♪\n♪ The driver doesn't worry ♪ ♪ if he takes the journey slow ♪\n♪ if he takes the journey slow ♪ ♪ driving the Ōkaihau Express ♪\n♪ driving the Ōkaihau Express ♪ So we have our Invercargill gate\nin seven minutes  but I think we know what\nwe want to do  right? We know what we wanna do. We have the budget \nwe have our plan. I think we're gonna skip it.\nYeah. Our plan is absolutely devilish  and I would like to\nsee the boys' reactions when they find out\nwe're skipping this one. Is it devilish? It is quite devilish 'cause\nwhat if they have a lot of hope? What if they're driving\nright now thinking  \"Oh  you know \nToby and Sam are about to stop in Invercargill.\nWe'll catch them there.\" I feel like they probably\nexpect us to skip out. That would require\nthem to have a detailed accounting of all our coins. That's true. Okay  Adam  I have some predictable but\nextremely bad news. Lay it on me. They have blown straight\nthrough Invercargill. Okay  so they have\nskipped Invercargill. Yep  they just texted. I'm very grateful to have\ndone this with you  buddy. And I  you. It's been an incredible trip. It has been an incredible trip. We've seen and done\nso many things. We have packed a months-long\nNew Zealand vacation into five very  very intense days.\nVery intense days. Yep. Yeah. But we had fun. We had a great time. And you know  we'll say\nit to 'em in person. Congratulations to Sam and Toby. They played great.\nThey earned this win. They played  I would say \nalmost flawlessly. Very nearly. I mean  maybe one or\ntwo hiccups  but... I mean  in terms of anything\nthat they had control over... I don't think they\nmade a single mistake. I would say they\ndidn't make a single mistake that I'm aware of. Yeah. They earned the win.\nThey earned the win. This is the end of the road. State Highway 1 \nyou've done us well. We have survived the journey. Look at that.\nThat's literally it. It's the sign.\nThat's the end of the highway. There's the sign \nand there's no one with a Nerf gun hiding under it. Oh  this is so exciting! Alright  this thing has\nserved us incredibly well. I'm surprised this hasn't\nbroken down 'cause it's so old. Not once  not once  but— Neither of us really knows\nhow to fix a car on the road. Yeah  but we gotta\nfinish it up on foot. Nearly there. Nearly there. It's just a couple\nhundred feet further now. It's Lookout Point. We're nearly there.\nLet's go! Charge the last few meters.\nLet's go! Let's go! Let's go! We've done it. Hopefully  no Nerf guns here. Oh! We've done it! Amazing!\nHigh five! Season five. Oh my god. I can't believe we've\nactually done it. Wow. Congratulations to you  Toby. You are now the world's only\nundefeated Jet Lag champion. Number one. Number one. Congrats  Sam.\nThat was incredible. Your winning\nstreak has started. You were a fantastic partner. Couldn't have done it without you. Now let's just see when\nBen and Adam get here. We're on lookout on Lookout Point. Lookout Point. There they are. Sam... Toby...\nWelcome. Congratulations on winning\nJet Lag season five. Thank you  Ben. Adam... You have something for them? I do. Got it here in my pocket. Oh  it's so cute this season. Wanna hold it together? We're kidding. We're kidding \nwe're kidding here. Whoa-ho-ho! It's a big one. Look at that thing! Oh my god! To the ocean. We did it  Toby. Thank you! Amazing stuff. Toby  how are you feeling? Undefeated champ. You're an undefeated champ. And I'm feeling pretty tired. Yeah  I imagine\nyou might have been. Any particular expansion\nyou like to make on that? I might be... jet lagged. Ohhh!\n(group shouting) Whooaaaa! See you in season six! See you in season six!\nBye! Adam  wave bye. Bye! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Man  New Zealand\nwas pretty great  but... I sure do miss riding on trains. Yeah  I'd love to do\nanother train season  but we already did Europe. Where else has a lot of trains? I don't know \nwe'll figure it out. Was that good? Yeah  I think we got it. Okay  cool. We cannot wait to\nbring you Jet Lag: Japan! We think it's gonna be an\nabsolutely incredible season. We're recording this in the past \nbut when you're watching this  we'll have actually just\nfinished filming the season. And the wait is not\nthat long actually. That's because we put every\nsingle episode of Jet Lag one week early on Nebula. Also on Nebula  you\ncan listen to our Nebula-exclusive podcast \nThe Layover. It's our weekly recap podcast where we talk about the\nlatest episode of Jet Lag. And now that the\nwhole season is out  we can talk about\nthe whole season. So we're gonna have\na whole big recap talking about everything\nthat happened  and we're gonna be able to\ntalk about what happened after the season stopped filming. Which was that  I don't\nknow if you know this  but the day that Ben and I were\nsupposed to fly back to New York  Auckland had the biggest\nflood in its history  and the airport flooded  and all the flights were\ncanceled for multiple days. Little bonus adventure  yeah.\nIt was bad. Adventure is one thing\nyou could call it. And so you can find out all\nabout that on The Layover. And if you need more Jet Lag\nduring the off season  you can watch our\nNebula-exclusive pilot season for Jet Lag\ncalled Crime Spree  where we found the 33\nweirdest laws in America  and we put them on a map. Sam had to go around the country\nbreaking them for a couple of days while Adam and I\nchased him around. It's a lot of fun. We really had no idea\nwhat we were doing. Yeah  we learned that season\nthat an important part of filming these\nseasons is eating. And rest periods.\nAnd sleeping! There were no\nrest periods that season. Zero rest periods. So if you want to\nsee the most miserable moments of my life... Crime Spree. Go watch it. As you can tell \nthe best Jet Lag viewing experience is on Nebula. And you know  there's\na reason why we make the best viewing experience\nfor Nebula subscribers. That's because this show \nsince day one  has basically been entirely\nfunded by our Nebula subscribers. You might have noticed\nwe've never had another sponsor. Essentially every dollar of\nrevenue we've had on the show is from Nebula and from\nour Nebula subscribers  which we appreciate immensely. And that's why we \nyou know  do things like release the episodes\none week early. That's why we do\nthe Layover podcast. That's why we want to create this great experience for\nour Nebula subscribers  and we would love for\nyou to become one. Especially because  you\nknow  when you sign up at nebula.tv/jetlag  our link  a portion of that subscription\nfee goes to us forever  which we  you know  again \nreinvest in the show. And you know  that's\nwhat's brought it from kind of this show that was season one  you know  just\nin one corner of America all the way to the other side\nof the world  New Zealand  which is obviously costlier. And we cannot wait for you\nto see the next season. And you can become the\nvery first person to see it and  you know  get all\nof that off-season stuff with the podcast and\neverything and Crime Spree. Again  nebula.tv/jetlag. Sign up and we\nreally appreciate it. See you there. Bye!\nBye!"

        "transcript": "We're racing to see who can\nvisit the most American states over the next four days \nand New York isn't claimed yet. So let's... Go  go  go  go  go! Okay  Brian  Brian. Ben  Ben  Ben! This way! This way  Ben! Okay  pull seven cards.\nPull the top seven cards. Oh my god  hurry up. We gotta draw seven cards. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7.\nPull the cards  pull the cards. 1  2  3. 4  5  6  7. Seven  okay  let's check them out. Okay  so the goal in\nthis game is simple: claim the most states\nby the end of four days. Both teams just drew a hand\nof seven challenge cards. In order to claim a state \nthe team must go to the state and complete any one of those\nseven challenges now in their hand. Once you claim a state \nit's yours. But there's a twist. In this game  one team can\nattack another team's state by claiming two bordering states\nand entering their opponent's territory to declare a battle... where both teams compete\nin a special challenge drawn from the new Battle Deck. If the attacking team\nwins the battle  they steal the state\nand lock its ownership. There are more rules\nand complications  but we'll explain them\nonce they're relevant. For now  the teams need to\nlook at their cards and start claiming some states. What are they?\nHere are cards. Photograph... Praise the ugliest building. Sell something from a pawn shop. Respect the weirdest—\nClean up national— Phew  okay. We can go to the\nugliest building. We need to pick one.\nQuickly  quickly  quickly. Go to Grand Canyon.\nThat's not possible. No  no. Ship this card  no.\nVisit every Spirit Halloween  no. Eat and In-N-Out  no.\nThat's possible? Why not? Eat soup in a helicopter?\nOh  oh. Let's check Blade. The ugliest\nbuilding is close to here. It's that giant skyscraper that\nall the billionaires live in. Oh  I hate that building.\nYeah  yeah  yeah  yeah. What's it called?\nWhat's it called? What's it called? 432 Park Avenue. Let's run.\nThat way's north? Okay  go north. Go north.\nOr actually start by going... Aaah! Manhattan to Newark \nas soon as possible. Oh (bleep)  oh. Why is it not working? Why are there no\nhelicopters available? So this is really bad for us. In playtesting  the\n\"Eat soup in a helicopter\" card has actually given teams\na huge head start in New York  because a company called\nBlade has regular helicopters from Manhattan to Newark Airport. But none of them are\nleaving today  because... It might be this weather.\nThe weather's kind of bad. Here  see the mist?\nOh yeah. Oh  that is so unlucky. What other ones do we have? There's not a whole lot there\nthat we can do at New York. High five at the highest point. Win a top-tier prize\nat a carnival game. Go to the Grand Canyon. Ship this card.\nVisit every Spirit Halloween. Oh  we're— these are really bad. What do we do? Okay. Cross  cross  cross. Alright  Ben  there's city bikes. Let's get a city bike. Okay  scan to unlock. Come on  come on  come on. Okay yeah  it's unlocked.\nLet's go  baby. Come on  Ben! Maybe the Spirit Halloween one \nbut we'll have to go up to Rhode Island or something. What is Spirit Halloween? We have to visit every\nSpirit Halloween in the state. Is that like a store? You don't know Spirit Halloween? You have so much to learn\nabout America  Brian. There's so many red lights! Look  all the lights are red. Turn green  baby.\nThere we go. All greens. Let's keep pace  we got this. Oh  what if we went to DC? For the purposes of the game \nDC is considered a state. Alright  look  there's only a single\nSpirit Halloween in Washington  DC. I feel like that's\nour only play right now. I think Spirit Halloween... Oh yeah  Spirit Halloween\ngets us a power-up  so we could use the power-up\nto exchange our cards. Okay. And then work our way north. In addition to claiming states \nsome more difficult challenges come with an extra reward:\nPower-up Tokens. Challenges like this earn you one \nand the very hardest earn two. These tokens can be spent at any time\non one of the four power-ups in the shop: Border Unlock  Card Swap \nCard Shuffle  and Tracker. We'll explain more later  but just know\nthat if played at the right time  they can completely change\nthe course of the game. What's the fastest way\nto get to Washington? Acela  train.\nOkay. Well  we could look for\na flight  but I think train. So we should go to\nPenn Station  34th Street. So... that way. Alright  we're five blocks away. Okay  three blocks away! We're one block away.\nNo word from them yet. Really hoping that they're\nnot about to claim New York. Stromae is coming\nto Madison Square Garden. Are you a Stromae fan  Brian? I am  I love Stromae. Oh hey. You are a Stromae fan?\nYeah. Oh  look who it is!\nWe should go to that concert. Two slim men. Two men  two slim men. Let's cross. Ben and Adam are probably\nbeing so frantic right now. We're at 432 Park Avenue. Things that we like about it \nwhat does the card say? How many things do we like\nabout it do we have to say? I think  it's either three or five. I like that it floods a lot. I like that when the—\nThat's one. When the trash goes from the top  it moves so quickly that it\nreaches terminal velocity  and it shakes all the\napartments below. That's very funny. I like that it uses this weird\nworkaround in zoning codes  so that it can be taller\nthan it should be able to be. Alright  that is New York claimed.\nLet's call them. Okay. Brian  the news is not good. It is eighteen minutes\ninto the game  and we just got the message\nthat New York is— Hello gentlemen  we have just\nclaimed the beautiful state of New York  home to the greatest\ncity in the world  baby! Oh  home state advantage\nis what I call that. Woo! Love that for us. Their videos are always very cryptic.\nHave fun wherever you're going! I mean  we knew that\nwas gonna happen. But it happened\neighteen minutes in. I would like for the record\nto show  to demonstrate that we got (bleep)-ed by our card. So (bleep)-ed.\nAnd clearly they got super lucky. (angry grumble) Okay. Now that we've claimed New York \nthat card gets discarded. We'll draw a new card into\nour deck  and that card is... I don't know what it is.\nI don't see it. File a Geodetic Mark\nRecovery Form. That's a really good card.\nIt's a really good one. It's easy. I think\nwe should save that. Yeah. I mean  the real question right\nnow is  do we go for New Jersey  or do we go for Pennsylvania  or do we go for Connecticut? Basically  we can go north \nor we can go south. Somewhat counterintuitively \nyou would think that the move is to obviously go straight north. It's actually hardish\nto maneuver up north. Once you go past Boston \nand that main northeast regional line is ended \nit's really tough. I think that New England is\ngonna be dealt with later in the game  like maybe at the end of today\nor beginning of tomorrow. I kind of think that the\nsouth is a better way to go. I think what we should do\nis we should get on a train that will go through\nNew Jersey to Philadelphia. If we can— If they haven't\nclaimed New Jersey by then  then we could consider\ngetting New Jersey on our way. But otherwise  we'll be\ngoing straight to Philly. Okay  so we need\nto go to Penn Station. Penn Station.\nGet on an Acela. There should be one at 9.\nI bet we could make that. We've made it  Brian. Oh  is this where Penn Station is?\nThat's Penn Station  yeah. It's right around\nMadison Square Garden. It's a little moist out  isn't it? It's a little bit moist.\nA little bit moist  but it's— I'm also a little bit moist. You mean sweaty  right? Yes  sweaty.\nOkay  just clarifying. Here  Sam. We've made it  it's 'To Trains'. It's the cousin of 2 Chainz \nyou know. That's the stupidest joke\nI've ever heard you tell. Thank you  Brian.\nI love it. Push it firmly  all the way in. Penn Station. Will you take a photo\nof me in the...? Yeah  just pose for a photo  Brian. Yep  pose  pose.\nNope  pose. I know it's a video.\n(wheezing giggles) Brian  what time did you... Picnic style. What time did you\nget to sleep last night? Like three hours ago. (giggles) Yeah. My flight got delayed  and I came in three hours\nlate  four hours late. And then a storm started and\nwe got delayed another hour. So I got into New York—\nDid you ask for oat milk? I didn't ask for anything. This is a\nWorld Trade Center bound... We need to go to\nlike Moynihan  right? Yeah. Okay yeah  we oughtta\nget out of here  I think. Gonna be honest  Ben \nwe don't have that much time. I know.\nEighteen minutes. But it's right here. Good thing about DC is we're\nright next to Virginia and Maryland. Yeah.\nSo we can  in fact  we can even take the Metro\nto Virginia and Maryland. Which means  that\nleaves super frequently. And 'cause the difficulty\nwith state borders is we can't cross them in Ubers or rental\ncars without having a power-up. This is another big rule. Teams aren't allowed to cross state\nborders in Ubers or rental cars. And actually  we're not even\nallowed to get within two miles of state borders in\nUbers or rental cars  which prevents us from\ndriving right up to the border and just walking across. We did this to incentivize\npublic transits  and also because a show\njust about us driving rental cars around\nwould be boring. If we really need to cross a\nstate border in a car  we'll need to unlock the border\nusing the Border Unlock power-up. Otherwise  we need to find a way\nto cross borders on public transit. So in a way  DC's actually... I mean  we can get to\nthree states pretty quickly. Yeah  we're gonna need\nto rack them up quickly. I'm actually feeling\na little more confident. Assuming we get lucky\nwith our cards. What do you think Ben and\nAdam are up to right now? There's every chance the world \nhonestly  that they're on our train. Yeah  they could be\nhere right now. The new remodeled Moynihan Station \nand it's actually shockingly nice. Sexy as hell. Thank you  Kathy Hochul. I actually don't know that Kathy\ncan really take credit for this. Oh  there's some squeaky shoes. Oh yeah.\nListen to that squeak  baby. That way they know we're coming.\nThis is the content you crave. Wait  I just realized \nthey might be on this train. It's perfectly likely. It's like very possible. I hadn't thought about that. Down this way. This  yeah  yeah  train hall. Let's see. 21  51. Ben  Ben  Ben. Hey guys! Go  Brian. We're just talking. Ow  look at these guys. Oh (bleep) How's it going?\nHey. My god  you wouldn't be\nhappening to get on the 9 am train  would you? Oh no  we're just hanging out.\nWe're just getting coffee. Oh  sure  sure. Nice to see you guys.\nNah  it makes sense. Good to see you  man.\nIt's been so long. But this will be interesting. I am now tired and sweaty. (laughs) It's a perfect combination. I'm fully dronched. Brian  touch my back. Oh  you're like me  ugh. Hey Brian.\nThat was sabotage. I don't know why I agreed\nto that. It was very wet. Bye guys!\nLet's go chat. That's interesting. Well  this will be interesting. I mean  we don't know\nwhere they're getting off. It's more valuable for us\nto know where they're going  than for them to know\nwhere we are going. Right. Let's just follow them around\nso they can't strategize. Oh no  they got further ahead of us. Did you know that the\netymology of Jamaica  New York and Jamaica  the country \ntwo completely different roots? Is it?\nYeah. What  how? Because the Jamaica from New York \nthat survived from an indigenous word. And Jamaica the country...\nOh. Yeah  just happened\nto be the same word. Hi  guys. 'Kay  we're on car six. We overheard them say car six \nso one of us can just hang out. The handy thing with\nAdam's talking so loud... He's very loud. You can hear him so far \nand his voice just travels. Newark is not close to Pennsylvania \nbut Philadelphia is close to New Jersey. That is true. So maybe it's worth going\nto Philadelphia regardless. I think Philadelphia regardless. ...throughout the train... Alright  so the deal is\nthat we really want to know where Ben and Adam get off.\nThat's gonna be crucial info. So we're gonna stop in Newark\nsoon  which is where they would get off for New Jersey. I'm gonna go just\nhang out near them to see where they get off. Alright  I spotted Adam in this car. I'm gonna stay hidden for now. So hopefully they don't realize\nthat we realize where they are. Sam is spying on us. I just saw him. Alright  we're in Newark. The question is \nare they getting off here? I'm gonna look for them. Looks like they're staying on. He's just staring at us. Guys  go back to seats  please. Alright.\nOkay. Okay  so Brian  wake up. Wake up. You awake? 'Kay  so juicy intel  okay? Juicy?\nJuicy intel. So they... Adam was off the train. He spotted me watching him \nand then got back on the train. Next stop is Philadelphia \nso we'll see if they get off there  'cause that'll makes sense. Where are they seated? They got out of their seats. They're in the cafe car now. Should I go bother them? You could. Hi  Brian. Hi  Brian.\nCan I get a coffee here? You can. What? You can get a\nStarbucks coffee here. How're you all doing? Doing well. How are you?\nHow are you feeling? Had a game of chicken there. We did a game of chicken. That's interesting. Alright  so looks like we're\nboth going to Philadelphia. We've looked at our cards. Pretty confident that we have a\nplan that is gonna screw 'em over. Oh  I guess  theoretically \nthey don't have to get off here. They could stay on until DC. They could. That'd be stupid of them. Would be. But they could do it. They could do it  but\nit'd be stupid in my opinion. Alright. I have to imagine that\nthey're getting off here. I'm gonna go find Adam and Ben. We're waiting. Are they not getting off? Are they staying on the train? Are they going to DC? Let's make sure\nthat they don't get off. I'll look at this one. (wheezing chuckle) You should rush. You've got some\nchallenges to do. Well  would appear that\nwe have a little bit more time in Pennsylvania than\nwe might've thought. So they're super sketched out. So they're still on? No  they got off.\nOh  they got off? They got off \nbut they were waiting to see what we would do again. Oh. Okay. Okay  I think we\nshould reconsider the plan. I think we should reconsider. I think we can do a\nlonger challenge here. I'm... surprised. So  I mean  we could do\nthe pawn shop one. I mean  my only hesitation really is\nthat I almost wanna save that card. It's a good one. But...\nBut we also— We could claim\nboth these states quickly  and I'm not that worried about\nthem getting either of them. No  cuz they're still going south. Yeah. Alright  so I know things\naren't looking great for us  but we've got a plan to\nget back in the game. The card we're doing in DC\nwill earn us a power-up  which we can use to swap\ntwo cards with Ben and Adam. Because DC is so close\nto Maryland and Virginia  and is connected to both by Metro  we can theoretically use the\neasy cards we steal from them to claim them super fast \nputting us at three states. If we can then race to\nnearby Delaware  we'd be at four and in a\nposition to steal Pennsylvania. We just have to hope that\nBen and Adam take long enough claiming Pennsylvania and New Jersey\nthat we can beat them to Delaware. Alright  let's get these bikes. We're headed to\nCash Express Pawn Shop  and we have to take\nbikes because... Philadelphia's right on the\nborder with New Jersey  which is convenient for this card  but also inconvenient 'cause\nwe can't take a rental car. So we're biking again. Bikes! Look everyone  it's\nbeautiful Philadelphia. Home of the... Phillies and\ncheese steak and... Big Bell. And a big bell \nand the Constitution. Alright. Adam.\nAlright. Pawn shop's a block away. Hello. So we have kind of a\nweird thing that we're doing. We have to buy something\nfrom one pawn shop  and then we have to sell it\nat another pawn shop  and we have to get at least 50%\nof whatever we bought back. What would be a thing that\nwe would be guaranteed to get back at least half\nof what we paid for it? 'Cause every pawn shop\nwould do one third. 'Cause the pawn shop's\ngonna have to make money. Alright  let's go. Welcome to the nation's\ncapital  Washington  DC. Why doesn't America\nhave more train stations? What the hell? This is so cool.\nIt is cool. I mean  I'm wondering if the\nkey is to get something that's really cheap so that they'll be willing to\nif we need an extra dollar for... That's what I'm saying. That they'll maybe just\nbe willing to be nice to us. What would you let that go for? Six and 10? Yeah? I think  let's give it a shot. I think we should try that. Alright. Okay  so we got stuck in the\npawn shop for a really long time. That guy thought what we\nwere trying to do was crazy. Yeah  the guy at the\npawn shop was like  \"There's no way you'll get\n50% back on like anything.\" Our plan is we've bought\ntwo rings. We bought the cheapest things\nthat they had at the pawn shop. And we're gonna go to the\nother pawn shop  and we bought one\nof the rings for just $6. And we're hoping that\nif we just beg them  they'll give us $3 for it. Three dollars.\nI'm nervous. We'll see. I'm from here  born and raised. So I insisted that we\nconsider this a state  'cause it kind of should be. And the only reason it isn't is\nbecause of politics and racism. So anyway  we're\nconsidering DC a state  which is actually super useful\nfor challenges like this  where we have to do\neverything in a state. We just gotta visit the one\nSpirit Halloween in the state. Is that the White House? No. Yes  that's the\nCapitol  Brian. Look at the Capitol.\nMy god. Show 'em the Capitol  we\ngotta get in the train though. \"God damned Libs!\" PATCO to New Jersey. We gotta do this quick \nBrian  because... So we just need to take the Metro \nthe Red Line to Friendship Heights. We'll do this quickly. And then we're going to steal\ntwo of their cards  right? Yes. And then we can just\nwalk across the border. It's literally across the street\nfrom this Spirit Halloween  and do something in Maryland. Wait  the border is across\nthe street from where we're going? From the Spirit Halloween. Yeah.\nReally? Yeah  it's perfect. Holy crap.\nYeah. Oh man  your legs are so fast. I only got little legs. That's yours. Isn't this nice? It looks exactly like\nsome stations of Paris. Yeah  the DC metro\nis so weirdly nice. It just catches on fire all the time. Catches on fire? Yeah  but it looks nice \nand that's what matters. How does it catch on fire?\nJust like casually. ...center of the car. For those of you  including Brian \nwho don't know Spirit Halloween  it's like this shop that pops\nup for a month or two right before Halloween \neach year. And all across the US  and\nthere's like loads of them. And very conveniently  there's\none and only one in DC. There it is  Brian. The Promised Land. See  the little Spirit Halloween?\nOh wow. Isn't it weird that we\ntraveled four hours to get here? Hello  how are you? Hi there.\nHow are you? Look  Ben  it's\nbeautiful New Jersey. The heart of America. Where are you? Alright. Oh wow. I'm overwhelmed by\nthe choices  Sam. Sam  I think you should\nget the bald cap. Bald cap? Actually yeah \nthat would be funny. Thank you. Success. Do you think you're gonna be\nable to fit it onto your head? That's a good question.\n'Cause I have a giant noggin. I just have to get this on \nand then we can call them. Oh Jesus (bleep)! (shudders) (chuckles) You look like Benjamin Franklin. That's Maryland.\nNo  that's DC! Sam's calling. Oh  hey guys. So you have a bald cap on? A bald cap  what? I'm trying to imagine what\nchallenge would involve that. I shaved. I shaved. You look great.\nYou're looking really good. We come to you from our\nnewest state  the 51st state of the\nUnited States  Washington  DC. We figured as much.\nWe figured as much. While we're at it  we just\nneed to quickly draw a card  and then we'll be taking\ntwo of yours. So... stand by. Alright  we're standing by. Brian  you wanna take the top card? Just take the top one?\nYeah  but don't let them know. Show the camera  but not them. That's pretty good.\nLet's keep that. So are we— we're\ndefinitely swapping cards? I think we should. Yeah  I think we need to\nget some rid of some cards. We've made our selection. You guys are gonna be taking\nhigh five at the highest point. Okay. And win a top-tier\nprize at a carnival game. Okay.\nWe get those  okay. Here are ours. We're gonna tempt\nyou with some options. Respect the weirdest\nroadside attraction. Weirdest roadside attraction.\nSell something... from a pawn shop\nto a pawn shop. File a Geodetic Mark\nRecovery Form. That's a good one. Clean up a national park. That's hard.\nCriticize the most beautiful place. Take a Chevy to a levee\nand eat pie. Photograph your\npartner from far away. I think we want geodetic marker and photograph your\npartner from far away. I think so too. Lock it in?\nYeah. We're gonna take the geodetic\nmarker and photograph from far away. Okay.\nOkay. Well  thank god they didn't\ntake the pawn shop one  but that still really sucks. In my mind  we need to\nspeedrun Maryland to Virginia  so I think we should use\nthose easy ones for Maryland and Virginia. Me too.\nSo... Let's maybe quickly look at the\nlocations of geodetic markers  see if there's one really nearby. By the way  geodetic markers are these\nsmall metal discs that are hidden all over the country\nto serve as reference points for surveying and map making. There's actually a pretty\ninteresting video about them. Well  not that interesting \nlike Half as Interesting. There's one just like down\nthe street  apparently. Fantastic. We have to find it and\nthen fill out this form. And then in that case we\ncould do the other one. And... and... I have a feeling Ben and Adam might be regretting not\nusing those cards sooner. I told you in the car!\nI know. About how if we don't use the\ngood cards that he is gonna steal them. That's exactly what he did.\nWell it was also  they did exactly what you had\nsaid they were gonna do  which is go all the way\ndown south. To DC. Get a power-up  swap \n'cause they had terrible cards. I just want  and it wasn't\non camera  so I'm annoyed. But I just want it to be known  I predicted this exact thing\nwould happen. Yeah  and it happened. And it kind of sucks \nbut it's also fine. You might have noticed\nthat we very intentionally stood with the pawn shop over here \nso they couldn't tell we were at one. Alright  it's now time for\nus to go and beg these people to give us $3 for this ring. Hi  good  how are you? So we have sort of a\nstrange thing to explain. We bought a little ring for $6 \nand we're hoping against hope that you'll give us $3 for it. We came all the way\nfrom Pennsylvania to sell you this ring for $3. Three dollars. Yes!\nYes! Yes. Thank you so much.\nThis is a miracle. Here's my driver's license. We got it  baby! We've done it. This is an official ad\nfor E&B Pawnbrokers. We love E&B Pawnbrokers \nfor all your pawning needs. If you are in... what  western New Jersey. Alright  time to call Sam. Oh  that's a huge relief. I was so nervous. Okay  we're getting a call. Alright  let's see what\nthey have to say. Hey guys. Hello gentlemen. We have claimed\nPennsylvania and New Jersey. Congratulations. Finally. What did they get? Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In one go? Yeah  so they probably\ntransported a pumpkin or something. Can we see your pumpkin? Yeah  show us your pumpkin. You just saw our cards. Show us your pumpkin\nin a eucharistic way. I think that as our boss  you saying \"show us your\npumpkins\" is harassment. Yeah.\nI said singular. This is going online. Your lawyer wants\nto see your pumpkin. Alright. Good luck  guys. See you soon. Bye!\nBye! Alright  now we gotta\ndecide what we're gonna do. We have bunch of\nreally tough cards. But we get to pull\none new one. But we get—\nMaybe that one will be good. Let's do that. Our new card is... What is it? Oh  Ben! Is it a tough one? Touch both oceans\non the same day. Touch both oceans\non the same day. It's not great. Look  Maryland. It looks like it\nmight be in this... on that side of the fence. I don't really have a good\nsense of how accurate this is. Yeah. I don't think that's it. They're usually smaller \nbut let's check it out. Yeah  that's not it. Did you get the coordinates? I can't get them to load in Google. So I think what we should do \nyou see there's that one... and then there's\n1  2  3  4 more right there. So how about we go over there? Howdy. Now you might be\nwondering  Ben and Adam  how are you able to\ntake an Uber across this state border from\nNew Jersey to Pennsylvania? Well  in the rules  if you\nhave claimed a state  then you can transit\ninto it however you want. So you own a state \nand we own Pennsylvania. We can enter it however we'd like. And the way we would like\nis anywhere. Alright  let's start looking. Could be anywhere\nunder these leaves. Anything? Could it be on the\nother side of the road? Brian? I don't think we should\nwaste time with that one. I think let's go to these ones \n'cause on the map  it looks like they're\nprobably newer ones. So we are in the\nPhiladelphia train station. We are headed to Delaware. Right... That cutie right there. Right there  baby. It's very close.\nIt's a very quick train. Yeah  so the reason that we're\ngoing for Delaware is that if we claim Delaware \nit's protected  because we own every state\nthat borders it but Maryland. So they wouldn't be able to\nget two states bordering it. Plus  they're almost certainly\ngoing for Maryland right now  I have to assume. And if they do that \nand with Delaware  we would have two states bordering\nMaryland and we could claim it. Also... we're able to get a power-up\nin Delaware pretty easily by going to the highest point\nand high fiving there. 'Cause Delaware is very small  and the highest point is\nquite near Wilmington. There's a 20 minute train\nfrom here to Wilmington. Yeah  and that's a card\nwe want to get out of our hand. Yeah.\nBefore we head west. We look like such\n(bleep)ing weirdos. This is the exact\nmarked spot  but... This challenge was not as\neasy as I thought it was gonna be. Yep. That could have been a mistake. What is this?\nCan you imagine if that's it? Oh no  this is like\nsome cart thing. There's another one  right? Yeah  should we just\ngo to that one? Oh my gosh. One real meal a day  baby. Okay so  good news  bad news. So it turns out that there\nare descriptions of what these look like on these. But this one  it turns out \nwas installed in 1969. And there's a mark from\nsomething called the US Power Squadron \nwhich sounds awesome. That they could not\nfind the mark in 2002. So they couldn't find the mark. And the Power Squadron \nI put  I trust the Power Squadron. I do too.\nSo... Ugh  all of these have notes saying\nthat they couldn't find them. The Power Squadron must\nhave found some  right? (bleep) Power Squadron. The Power Squadron did find this one. Oh  that's guaranteed. Okay  check this out. There's a photo for this one \nand the Power Squadron found it. It's in Bethesda. I think we\ncould take the Metro there. Let's go!\nMore running. Oh  we got one of\nthe new Metro lines. How great it is to get\nwater in there on the way back. You need to bring more water. You need water. I was already\ncarrying too much weight. It's why I'm so out of breath. I wondering if there's\nsomething that you could have not\nbrought  Brian  that you— This is foreshadowing\nright here  right Brian? I couldn't leave it behind. I spent $400 on it. I did not agree for\nyou to buy that $400— You told me to expense anything\nthat I needed for Jet Lag. You didn't need that  Brian.\nI expensed a (bleep) telescope. You didn't need that. There it is. We (bleep) found one. Nice job  Brian. Okay  now we gotta\nfill out the form. Okay  what's my agency code? I'm gonna put miscellaneous\ncommercial or private firms. We did it. Submission. My engineering\neducation did me good. Submission. Should we call the boys? We should call the boys.\nLet's call the boys. Okay. Ugh. Just got a video from\nSam and Brian. Not looking forward to watching it. Hey  Ben and Adam. We're coming from the\ngreat state of... M-M-M-Maryland. Maryland  okay. We have Maryland. We're hanging with the post office. Somehow that's the post office.\nCan't explain how. That's where we expected them to go. Now  I think that there's\nno doubt that it is going to be a scramble for Delaware. Fortunately  we're hopping\non a train to Delaware in  you know  15 minutes. And then it's a quick train\nand we're right there. So hopefully we can\nbeat 'em there. Let's go to Virginia.\nOkay. Right  Virginia? Are we going to Virginia?\nIs that what's happening? I mean  I think we\nwanna go to Virginia. Brian  we need to pull\nour next card. You gotta make it good.\nI mean  we can't shuffle these. So you're only allowed\nto pull the top one. What do we got? Spend $100 at Buc-ee's. So we gotta go to Texas or south. If you don't know \nBuc-ee's is a chain found only in the American South\nof extra big  extra fun gas stations ruled by an adorable  lovable mascot\nnamed Bucky the Beaver. I hate Buc-ee's so much  Sam. It's like  what if we\nmade a gas station... harder to get in and out of? Who wants to spend time\nin a (bleep) gas station? Alright  let's go. Which way? So  unbelievably lucky news.\nI did some research on the train  and there's a free\nobservation deck here. So... you can go up that. I'll go run a half mile away \nand this should be super easy. This is exactly where\nwe're gonna go regardless  'cause it's the closest point in Virginia \nand there's just a free observation deck. Amazing. And it'll be tied again. Oh  it's somewhere here. Just look for the View of DC. Apparently you need your ID to get in. I'll start running\ntowards that spot  okay? View of— the View? Yeah  it's this building.\nIt's this building? So just look for an entrance\nthat says The View of DC. It's on Google. If you miss it  I'm gonna\nstart running this way. We are coming from New York. We made some stops. Here  you wanna be on camera? Yeah! Hey  I'm so excited. This is exciting. We're going to the highest point.\nThe highest point in nowhere. It's not very high.\nNo. So what we have to do \nthough  is we have to... take a picture of us high fiving. Yeah? In midair. Drop off  then on the left. So if you wanna help  you\ncould take the picture of us. Okay.\nOh  that would be helpful. Which would actually\nbe really helpful. Yeah. Alright  we're here. Oh  incredible. Alright. The Metro is just there  and I just got straight into\nthis elevator within a minute. That was too easy. I now have to try to spot Sam from half a mile away\nfrom up here. Okay  now I have to\nfigure out where he is. I can see where he is. So he's at the top of\nthat skyscraper. So I just need to find\na clear line of sight. Alright. (giggles) This is so cool. Okay  this is the highest\nbenchmark monument in Delaware. I think we should stand on the\nbench  'cause that's even higher. Oh  that is true. Alright. Here we go. Alright.\nIt's scary. No  let's not. Oh  it's too slippery? Okay. I have to  I have a bit of a\nfinagling to do with this telescope. (bleep) Oh no  (bleep) I just twisted it out of spot. (bleep) I just need to be in the shot  and then I can start\nrunning back... and we'll have Virginia. and then I can start\nrunning back... and we'll have Virginia. Okay  wait.\nJump up and down. Here's...\nJump up and down. Okay  I can see you. I can 100% see you. You got me?\nI can see you. Yeah  I got you. Do some jumping jacks \nor something. I can't. One handed jumping. I can totally see you. Okay  you got a photo? Okay. One  two  three. Alright  I think I got it. You got it  you got it?\nYeah  I did. Yeah  yeah  yeah. We got it  we got it  we got it. Yes!\n(laughs) Alright  let's call 'em.\nWe got Delaware. Alright  I just\ngot word from Brian. I mean  I assume you just\nwatched him take a photo of me  'cause I was on the call with him. Oh wait  it's Adam. Oh no! Oh! That's not good. We  along with the help of\nour Uber driver  Keaundra  have claimed the\ngreat state of Delaware. Ah  damn. And we got a new team member. Yeah. Bye! Okay  so that is totally\nexpected that they got Delaware. I mean  that's exactly\nwhat we wanted them to do. Well  not that we wanted them\nto do  we expected them to do. That does mean that they're\nalmost certainly gonna initiate a battle challenge on\nMaryland pretty soon. Alright  with Delaware claimed  that means we have\ntwo states bordering Maryland. Pennsylvania and Delaware. Which means that we can go\nattempt to steal Maryland  which is exactly what\nwe're gonna do. Brian  what are you doing?\nWe gotta (bleep) go. Chicken nuggies.\nBrian  we're gonna race. We need to go— I think we\nshould move to Delaware. They haven't claimed Delaware.\nWell  news. They've claimed Delaware. Alright  we need to strategize. Actually first we need to call 'em  and let them know that\nwe've claimed Virginia. Sam is unexpectedly calling us. Where from? Hey guys.\nSponsor us  McDonald's. Hey guys. Hello? Coming to you from beautiful... Virginia.\nMcDonald's. Virginia.\nOh! Which is now our state. You hear that  Deandra? (laughs) I believe your name\nis Keaundra  right? Yes.\nWhat was it? The name's Keaundra.\nYou misheard her name. Keaundra.\nOur third team member. I'm sorry  Keaundra. Anyway  you hear that \nKeaundra? What'd he say? They've claimed Virginia \nKeaundra. Oh  wow.\nBut we don't even care. We don't care.\nWe don't care about that. Sure you don't  okay. Enjoy Virginia. Bye. Thank you for all your help.\nThank you so much  Keaundra. Yeah  no problem. We are back in the\nWilmington Amtrak Station. We have a train in about\n15 minutes to Baltimore. What could be better? Let's absolutely do it  baby. You still have your\nchicken nuggets here. Pull a card while we're at it. While we're here  it's\ntime to switch out our hands. What? (despondent chuckle) We are getting the worst cards. Ooh.\nOoh  this is a good one. This a really quick and easy one. Okay. Get your chicken nuggets.\nThese cards are screwing us. Where is there snow\nat this time of year? Aspen? Colorado  upper Michigan. There's like four resorts\nopen in the country. Well  we're off to war. If my guess is correct \nAdam and Ben are probably about ten minutes away\nfrom initiating battle challenge. So we think it's worth staying\nhere where there's shops and stuff around us\nthat we could use. So we want to give it\nat least 10-15 minutes to see if they start a battle challenge\nbefore going to the airport. Alright  it is 4:30. We are in the middle of\nMaryland on the train. So that means it's time to battle. Hello gentlemen. We've been expecting you. Yes.\nI imagine you might be. We hereby declare a battle\nin the state of Maryland. So here's how battles work. Once an attacking team has\nentered their opponent's territory and declared a battle  both teams have 30 minutes\nuntil a challenge card is drawn from the Battle Deck. Both teams will then compete in\nthe challenge simultaneously  no matter where in the\ncountry they are. Whichever team wins gets the state \nand its ownership is locked  meaning it cannot be\nchallenged again. It's currently 4:32. The battle will start at 5:02. Okay. Alright  our bellies are full and\nwe're in a really good position for the battle challenges  I think. We have a lot of stores around us.\nFeels like my stomach's too full. If I throw up a\nchicken sandwich  oh well. Okay.\nAlright. We are ready for battle. Are you prepared for battle? No  I— No  we're not. Are we filming?\nWe're filming. Your mic.\nYou ready? Oh yeah.\nYeah. Are you ready?\nYes  now we're really ready. The battle is...\nThe battle is... Oh  we're in a\ngood spot for this. Oh  we're in a very\ngood spot for this  Ben. Let's go! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Oh boy  that is quite the battle that Sam and those other\npeople have got going for them. I sure wonder how it ends. It's too bad that I have to\nwait a whole week to watch that. I just wish I could watch it now. Well  boy  do I have\nan answer for you  that person on the\nother side of the frame. It's called Nebula. Nebula is the streaming site that\nmyself and a bunch of other educational-ish creators\nfounded ourselves. And we post every single episode of\nJet Lag there one week early. That means that yes  you can\nwatch season four  episode two of Jet Lag right now on Nebula  and every episode after\nthat one week early. And at the end of this\nseason  just like last season  we're doing an aftershow where we\nanswer a bunch of your questions  talk about some of the strategy \nbring you behind the scenes a bit  and especially we show you\na lot of unreleased footage. So the best of that  we are\nshowing you on the aftershow that's exclusive to Nebula\nat the end of the season. You know  the reason we do this\nis because this show could not exist without Nebula \ntruly  as you can tell. It's an expensive show to film and\nthen do the post-production on. And the only way that we can\npay for that is the revenue that we get from the tens of thousands of\nyou that have signed up already just to watch Jet Lag\none week early. In addition to Jet Lag \nthere's loads of other really good stuff on Nebula. For example  we've made\na ton of stuff  our team. Here  I'll put on screen all\nthe different stuff that we've made that's exclusive to Nebula. And then 150 other really\nhigh-quality creators that you probably already watch\nare all doing the same thing too. You know  making exclusive stuff  posting\nstuff early  ad and sponsorship free. So there's loads of really good content. For example  if you remember\nthe guest from season two  Joseph from RealLifeLore  he has this\ngreat series called Modern Conflicts. It's about going nitty gritty\ninto how some modern wars and battles have have gone out  and that's stuff that you\ncan't really make on YouTube  because of their super\nstrict policies about talking about violence and war \nand advertiser guidelines and stuff. So this is something that\nlike  it's really good content and it's unique to Nebula. It could only exist because\nof the Nebula platform. And then in addition to all of that \nwhat's really crazy about this deal is the best way to sign up for it. And there has literally never\nbeen a better time to sign up. That's because we are running this\nbundle deal with Curiosity Stream  which is a whole other streaming site. They have really good non-fiction  smart content  documentaries \nand TV shows  and stuff like that. Really good stuff to add to your\nviewing repertoire if you wanna feel a little bit more enlightened\nby the entertainment that you watch. So we run a bundle deal\nwith them  where if you go to\ncuriositystream.com/jetlag and sign up for any subscription\non that page  they will throw a Nebula\nsubscription for free  for as long as you\nstay subscribed. It's a crazy good deal. Two streaming sites\nfor the cost of one  but it's actually less\nthan the cost of one  because they're running a\n42% off sale on that page. That is the deepest sale\nI have ever seen in the years we've\nbeen working with them. So it comes out to literally\n$11.50-ish or something. I'll put the correct number on screen. It's crazy low.\nThat's not per month. You probably think that's per month.\nThat's for the year. It's literally the cost of a burger for an entire year of\ntwo streaming sites  including exclusive content\nfrom Jet Lag  and every episode one week early. And you can watch the\nnext episode up right now  and boy is the next episode\nquite something. So I definitely encourage signing up \nand it helps support this channel  helps keep the lights on\nat this channel. So  click the button on screen \nor head over to curiositystream.com/jetlag\nto sign up right now. And thanks in advance\nfor your support."

        "transcript": "Welcome back to episode two\nof our race to get the most states. The rules are simple: the team that visits and\nclaims the most US states by doing a challenge from their\nhand of cards in four days wins. Eight hours into day one \nBen and Adam have claimed New York  New Jersey \nPennsylvania  and Delaware. Brian and I have DC \nVirginia  and Maryland  but maybe not for long. If a team has claimed\ntwo states bordering one of their opponent's states  they can enter the enemy\nterritory and declare a battle to steal their state  which is exactly what Ben and\nAdam just did in Maryland. The battle is...\nThe battle is... Okay  here are the\nrules of our first battle. At the end of 15 minutes \nthe team to find a license plate from a state or country furthest\nfrom their current location wins. The distance is measured from the\nlocation the plate was spotted to the closest point in\nthat state or country. Find the most\nforeign license plate. Oh  we're in a\ngood spot for this. There's a garage. Ho-ho  we're in a very\ngood spot for this  Ben! Let's go! Good luck  gentlemen.\nGood luck  gentlemen. Okay  time to go. Oh  it's time \ntime  time  time... Okay.\nSo we're at a train station. It's a hub. It's a travel hub.\nYeah. Seems like it\nwould be a good place. What is that? That's Maryland. Okay  Maryland  Maryland. Know where that is \nthat's Maryland. That's all Maryland. Can we go down\ninto the parking garage? Is there a parking garage? I think... there is? If there's a parking\ngarage  let's do that. Well  yes.\nOkay  that's a lot of cars. Great. That was—\nRetail and residential. Residential only.\nI feel like retail's gonna have— Yeah  residential will\nbe all around here. Here we go  here we go. Pennsylvania.\nPennsylvania. New Jersey  a little further. Virginia  Virginia. Virginia. Got a Colorado. Colorado? Yeah  that's pretty good.\nOkay. That's almost the\nwhole other side of the US. Delaware. Delaware. Virginia. Whoa  Virginia. We need like a California \nI mean California's... I mean Washington  I guess\nWashington State would be... Oh  don't tell me that's—\nOh  no  no. Oh  damn it. I thought that was\nthe Alaska one  but I remember Virginia has a\n\"no step on snek\" plate too. Remember  we need to keep a mental\nnote of where the good ones are. Ooh  California.\nCalifornia  yes. That's great.\nOoh  there's Washington. Texas here. We already got Washington. I have seen plenty of Hawaiian\nplates in continental US  'cause sometimes like \nyou know  people ship their cars back and forth. Alaska too. So there's still a shot that we\ncan get better than Washington. Well  that's great.\nThat was a really strong start. Maryland. Iowa.\nIowa. That's Maryland. Maryland  Maryland.\nOh  it is? Something feels very illegal\nabout just walking around  just filming license plates. Actually  I think our luck\nmight have turned. Turns out they're further to\nboth Washington and California. So if they manage to get\neither  we're screwed. Oh  I just know they\nfound a California one. There's so many Californians. California. Oh  California. I mean  come on. It's not gonna\nbe better than that. Let's hope. If this person comes\nfor their car  we have to implore\nthem to not leave. Okay. Alright  it's time.\nHere they are. Present to us your plate. What is that?\nWhat is that? I think it's a California. I can't see. Oh (bleep). You guys also\nfound a California? Found a California? But you're closer to\nCalifornia aren't you? Yeah  we know. We have the same \nbut you're closer. God damnit.\nFine  bye  I hate you. Alright  well... The state of Maryland is ours. A battle well fought. A battle well fought \ngentlemen. (silly grumbling) I hate this. Yeah.\nI hate this game. I'm not listening to them. Ben and Adam  I'm striking. We've claimed\nthe state of Maryland. We have battled them for it\nvaliantly  and we have succeeded. Ahh. But now  we have nine minutes\nto make our train to New York. We have  you know \nwe're busy people. We got places to be.\nWe got states to claim. We're going back to New York. But what do we do now? Because we only have\ntwo and a half hours left. So I don't know if we\ncan get on a flight. Maybe we fly to New York \nback to New York? Right now? Yeah  'cause then we're\nright next to Connecticut. You might be wondering why and\nhow we want to claim Connecticut. Well  let me take you back\nto a magical time called two hours ago. Why would we go\nnortheast  when we have all these\ncards in the west? If we get Connecticut\nand Massachusetts  we can start a battle\nchallenge on New York  which is where we'd wanna go anyway\nto get flights from Connecticut. So the only two that\nwe can do easily are: win a prize from a claw\nmachine  and ship this card. They're gonna start a battle\nchallenge soon on Maryland. Almost guaranteed.\nYeah  I think so. And we don't wanna be\non a flight during that. Yeah. So delaying ourselves a bit\nby wasting time shipping the card. Yeah.\nKind of a good thing? I think so. So should we do that?\nI think so. UPS.\nUPS Store. My cover story is my\ncolleague Brian McManus is currently traveling in New Haven  and I have to overnight\ndocuments to him  right? They're not gonna\nquestion what we're sending. Just be like it's a\n(bleep) playing card that we're shipping for fun. Where are we shipping it to? I'm thinking New Haven \n'cause that's right on the Amtrak line in Connecticut. Okay  back to the present \nwhere we're on a train to the airport in a desperate\nattempt to fly as close to New Haven  Connecticut\nas we can. Shoutout to Lockheed Martin. I love Lockheed Martin. They really help us\nspread democracy. Well  if you're wondering why\nwe're having difficulties  it's 'cause of this. Literally  almost every\nsingle flight is delayed. Delayed  delayed  delayed \ndelayed  delayed  delayed. So there's no flight\nback up north tonight. And I mean  there aren't\nother forms of transit that could take\nsomeone north  right? We're hopping on a train back\nto New York  where we started  and that'll get in right\nas the day is ending. The logic there\nis basically that... New England is\nstill wide open. It would be insane to leave\nthose states unclaimed. So we're gonna start tomorrow\nby trying to claim New England  so Connecticut  Rhode Island \nMassachusetts  and then maybe New Hampshire  Vermont  Maine. But those states are\nreally sticky to get to  so we'll have to see\nabout that. So like  yeah.\nWhere would be useful? Birmingham  not useful. Austin  you wanna go home? A little bit. Albany  leave at six? That's in New York. And then it's not easy to get to. It's not easy to get to\nConnecticut from there. I don't think\nwe have anything. I think we're hunkering\ndown 'til tomorrow. This sucks so hard. I guess let's just plan\nfor tomorrow. And that is a\nbeautiful looking map. Not looking\ngood for them  is it? Not looking good for them. Okay  so Brian and\nI spend like an hour researching and planning  with a focus on getting\nto New Haven  Connecticut  where we shipped our card. The bottom line was there\nwere no good options. Instead  we had to go with the\nleast bad option  which was... The one to Windsor Locks Airport  which is 40 minutes away\nfrom New Haven. We can get to New Haven\nby like 11:15. Is that the move? I think so. I think our main priority\nnow has to be to get another card in our hands. It gives us more options. And I don't think they'll\nbe going to Connecticut. We're feeling pretty\ngood about tomorrow. Yep  we can get to Connecticut\nas early as what  10:30 or so?\nYeah. So... Sam has a lot of\nground to make up  so good luck to him. Let's see. We gotta get a shuttle. We gotta get hyped\nfor the shuttle. Back of the bus \n'cause I'm a cool kid. You can't come back here. You can't hang with us. One time  I sat at\nthe back of the bus. And a kid that was younger\nthan me choked me. Alright.\nI'm very masculine. Do you see this beard? That's all testosterone. Okay. Welcome back to New York. Alright \nstep away this way. Okay. Okay  so there's a train\ntomorrow morning at 8:03 that we really want to take. But it leaves from Grand Central \nand we're in Penn Station. So we have 15 minutes to get from here to there. Huh? Perfect timing. Alright  one stop. Thanks. Alright  we have 10 minutes. So we just gotta basically\npick our spot for tomorrow. How about this bench? I like this bench.\nRight next to— Ooh  this is not\na comfortable bench. Five minutes! This is Grand Central Terminal. Two minutes to get\nto the main area. Wait  no. Oh no  Ben. This is the basement \nthis is the basement. Here we go. Okay. Welcome to the main terminal\nof Grand Central Station. What time is it  Sam? Is it 8 pm yet? Yes. Yes.\nDon't lie to me. Don't lie to me.\nIt's eight. We've made it  Brian. Is it actually 8 pm \nor are you just saying that for the camera?\nNo  it's actually 8 pm. It says it's five to eight\non my watch  you (bleep) liar. The New Haven Line\ndeparture board is right here. Tomorrow we'll be standing right\nin front of this departure board  waiting to find out what track\nwe're supposed to get on. But yes  let's go to sleep. I'm operating on\ntwo hours' sleep. I need— Yeah  I'm exhausted  and\nI had a full night's sleep. So I can't imagine\nhow exhausted you are. Graphic  go to sleep. Bye-bye.\nBye. Now  it's the rest period. At 8 pm Eastern Standard Time  both teams stop exactly\nwhere they are  go somewhere to sleep \nand then return to that exact spot at 8 am Eastern the next day. In this game  the rest period\ngets one hour shorter every day. So tomorrow it'll start\nat 9 pm Eastern  then 10 pm  then 11 pm. And now through the\nmagic of editing  it's 8 am the next day. Okay  it's 8 am. Our train is on track one. It's this way  it's this way.\nIt's this way. Oh  we can't miss this train. I don't know what that means. It's time \nit's time  it's eight. Give me your mic. Unfortunately it\nis on the lower level  which is less than ideal. 109. Okay  that wasn't too far. So the second we\nget to Connecticut  second we land \nwe really have to rush. Because one thing I\nwas realizing that I think we just failed to\nproperly consider yesterday is the possibility that they\njust got on a train north. If they did that  they could\nget to Connecticut early  but then they're down to the luck\nof the draw of a challenge. So I think it could be quite close. Train's still here. That's good.\nWoo. This is one ugly train. Let's go.\nYeah  they're ugly. Our aircraft is there \nbut it's now showing like 20 minutes delayed leaving \nwhich is not amazing. Nothing is going our way. Anyway  it's not that bad. As long as it doesn't\nget delayed more. Well  like 20 minutes\ncould be the difference between them getting it and... It could  yeah. We'll see. Okay  we have made it onto the\ntrain to New Haven  Connecticut. It's about a two hour train. It's a slow train. Yeah  we had a very exciting\nfirst three minutes of the day  and now we're gonna\nhave a very boring... Two hours.\nTwo hours. Hopefully Sam and\nBrian will do something interesting in this time. Yep  well hopefully it's\nnot claiming New England. Right  that would be bad. That would be\nvery bad for us. We are respecting the\nweirdest roadside attraction. Which in Connecticut\nis the Pez Visitor Center. So  the rules are as follows. We're gonna go to our\nUber as I explain them. Visit the weirdest roadside\nattraction in your state. You must stand directly in front\nof it and salute for the entire duration of the national anthem. If it is possible to gain\nadmission to the attraction  you must do so and spend\nat least 15 minutes there. And it is possible to gain\nadmission to this attraction. So we are gonna have to\nspend 15 minutes there. Now  there's a train at\n10:40 that we would really love to take to Providence. I think it's gonna be\nreally hard to make that  but it's... possible.\nIt's possible. Hurry  hurry  hurry  inside. We have to spend\nfifteen minutes inside. Oh shoot  visitor\ncenter's around this. No one's ever been\nin this much of a hurry to get to the Pez Center. Okay  we're inside. So we can leave—\nIt's 10:12. We can leave the\nPez Center at 10:27. Thank you.\nWonderful. It's a big Pez. This rocks. Oh my god  that is Sam. Isn't that him?\nThat's Sam. Brian reminds me of Popeye. Okay  that's interesting. Oh my god  they're making Pez. Look! It's magical. Ben  look \nthere's  that's Pez! This rocks. This freaking rocks. You wanna get\na bucket of Pez? No  I want a dispenser of Pez. That's the whole point. Pez  Pez  Pez. You look amazing as Pez. I'm Pez. Would you buy this? Looks very phallic. Alright  well \nnow I'm leaving. If they don't claim\nConnecticut  then we're fine. We just continue with the plan. If they do claim Connecticut  I think the move then... we're not far from the\nborder of Massachusetts. So we could go quickly claim\nMassachusetts  probably before they could\nget to Massachusetts. The problem is that we cannot take\nan Uber over the border without a power-up \nwhich we don't have. So we'd have to take public transit.\nLuckily  I just checked  there's a train leaving 35 minutes\nfrom a 10 minute Uber away. And that train is not frequent. It's across the\nborder  Springfield. We're allowed to leave in\none minute  but we still have to stand in front of the\nPez museum for the full length of the national anthem\nwhile saluting it. And then we have\ntwelve minutes to get 13 minutes away\nand get on a train. That might not happen. Alright  let's... Alright  go  go  go  go  go.\nsalute the Pez Center. Beautiful. Hi. It's time to draw\na new card. Weirdest roadside attraction\ngoes out of the hand. Phew  and we get a power up. And our new card is... Break a law from Crime Spree. This one requires\nsome explanation. On Nebula  the pilot season of Jet Lag: The Game\nis called Crime Spree  where we put the 33 weirdest\nlaws in the country on a map  and Sam went around\nbreaking them. So we have to find one of the laws that\nSam didn't break. Yeah.\nAnd break it. So we'll need to... We'll need to\nlook at that map. Need to look into that. 10:40. It's still here. Track two  track two. Did it leave? Is the train to Boston \nis it not here yet? Okay  awesome. Ohh... we made it.\nWe made it. Buy the tickets \nbuy the tickets. Oh my god  okay. Oh  here's the call.\nOkay  remember  no reactions. Hey guys. Hey guys  we've claimed\nthe great state of Connecticut. Congrats. Okay  we gotta go  bye. Bye. (bleep) So that's terrible. So we need to get\nthat train  right? How did they get here? Don't worry about it. We need to rush.\nAre we getting that train? Yeah  yeah. That is terrible. I'm like genuinely\npissed off now. This is every single thing\nis just not going our way. Yeah  we couldn't— I think we would've\ngot it if wasn't for the delay on the flight as well. I assume we'll just have\nto do the claw machine one. We'll have to find a claw machine. It's the only one we can do. Yeah  so... whatever. And that sucks 'cause now our card\nis waiting for us in New Haven. Just abandoned. And until we get\nthat card back  not only can we no\nlonger claim that card  now we only have six\ncard slots in our hand. So... And then the other problem\nis they're probably going into Rhode Island next. You ordering the Uber?\nYeah  there's nothing yet. They're probably going\nto Rhode Island next. And once they have\nRhode Island  they can battle challenge\nMassachusetts. They still haven't claimed\nanything since 3 pm yesterday. So that's what  five... That's eight and a half\nhours of game time. Yep.\nNothing. They've been dropping\nthe ball  and better yet  we've been having a fun\nconversation with the conductor of this train \nwho doesn't wanna be on video  because he would be\nhaving too much fun. And he gave us coffee. He gave us coffee for free. So we're in Windsor. We're going to Springfield. Oh wait  Springfield does\nhave service to Vermont. That could be important  'cause\nVermont and Massachusetts  that borders New York. Guys  sorry\nabout all this delay. What? Somebody up there\ndoesn't like it. Look  it's Dunkin'. That's how you know\nwe're in Massachusetts. By the way  welcome to\nMassachusetts  Brian. Thanks. I've never\nbeen here before. I always wanted to go to MIT. But it's too stupid. Hey  for Sam?\nHey  how's it going? This is WNNZ-AM 640  Westfield. Alright  we're looking\nfor something called Round1. Not Forever 21. We gotta be quick. Yes  we do. I already see claw\nmachines  that's great. We need to get a card. Come on  baby. We're allowed as many times— Oh (bleep)\nI thought I had it. Okay  that was bad. Come on. Go on. Yes! Yus!\nYou got it? I'm so happy  Sam. I've never felt so\njubilant in my life. They got a video.\nThey've sent us a video. Hey boys!\nWhere are they? Coming to you\nfrom our latest state. We've got a new mascot. Ma-Ma- Massa— You need to work\non that stutter buddy. You're supposed\nto say the second bit. —chusetts. —chusetts.\n—chusetts. —chusetts. Oh.  Oh.\nMassachusetts  it's ours. That's... We can go battle 'em\nif we get Rhode Island. Oh!\nWhich is right here. So we gotta get off the train. Yeah  well  we're gonna get—\nOh  wait  wait  wait. They're gonna go to Vermont\nand try to challenge New York. Well  that's why we\nhave to steal Massachusetts. Okay  we have to—\nwe're gonna get Rhode Island as quickly as possible.\nYep. And then we— In case we haven't\nsaid what we're gonna do  we're gonna get drunk.\nWe are gonna run off the train. I'm gonna get drunk\nas fast as possible. And then we are gonna\nget on the 1 pm Acela continuing on to Boston. So we are gonna have \nI think  35 minutes to get to a bar \nget Ben drunk  get back to the train\nstation  and get on a train. So good luck to us. Brian  we need to be\nquick in our decision making. Take advantage of that W. Take the top card.\nOh please god. It's gotta be good \nit's gotta be good. Build a raft  oh my god. Well  it's doable\nanywhere  which is good. And it gets us a star \nwhich is good. We do need the star. I think overall\nthat's pretty decent. But yeah  okay.\nLet's just research like crazy. Do you think going to\nRhode Island makes sense? Up we go. Oh  it's so pretty now. Oh  it is.\nShow everybody. It got pretty in Prov-town! God  a terrible shot.\nGet a better shot. You film what you wanna film. What's it called? Harry's Bar and Burger. Is it that? Yeah  it's that. Oh  great  okay. There's a cow with\nhorns outside of it. Howdy. Bar table's there. Oh bar  I just need to... take four shots of whatever\nliquor you recommend as quickly as possible. Okay  so despite claiming\nMassachusetts in literally two minutes  we then spent about a half\nhour researching and planning  and we were once again left\nwith zero good options and two bad ones. The train line up to Vermont\nonly runs once a day. Luckily it stops in Springfield\nin less than two hours. But then there's the problem of\ngetting out of Vermont  especially if we'd then be trying to get\ninto New York to challenge it. We could use a power-up\nto drive there  but we don't have any\npower-up tokens right now. Second  the nearest airport\nis back in Hartford  but because they own\nConnecticut  not us  we'd have to wait an hour\nfor a train to get in. But there's a pretty well-timed\nflight from there to Nashville  Tennessee where we\ncould knock out the Buc-ee's card  but we basically have to\ncede the Northeast. So  what to do? What's your thinking? Flight to Nashville. I just don't see any other  yeah \nI don't think going up north is  with the cards we have\ngoing up north. Yeah  I think I agree. We've seen how difficult\nit is just by being here  which is in a big city and we'd\nbe going to smaller cities. And we're doubling down\non the problem we currently have. I think at this stage \nwe are absolutely going to need the area bonus. Okay  so this is the last\nmajor game element we haven't told you about yet:\nthe area bonus. Whichever team claims\nthe greatest area gets an additional two points\nat the end of the game. It's a big deal. And the way things are going \nwe're gonna need that bonus if we want a shot to win. Yeah  but what we really\nneed for that is Texas. Yeah  which is why I'm\nsaying  like as long as we're moving in that direction.\nYeah. There's flights like every\nhour from Nashville to like... There are In-N-Outs in Texas. I think I agree. I think that we should cut\nour losses in the Northeast  and fly down to Nashville. Should we go for it? I think so. Alright  well let's\nget back to the Amtrak station then  I guess. Thank you very much. Shot number one.\nI'm gonna get silly. I'm drinking the branded\nwater from our Uber driver. He has his own brand of water. He does? That's awesome. Thanks. Alright. We got it.\nWe're making great time. Three. (wheeze)\nYou okay  you okay? Alright  alright  last one.\nHere you go. Alright  we've claimed the\nstate of Rhode Island  folks. Okay  it's okay  it's okay. Let's get outta here. I just think we\nneed to get outta here. I think—\nOh wait  I'm getting a call. That's weird. You okay? Yeah  it was so good. Hello  gentlemen.\nWe are now the proud owners of the great state of\nRhode Island  baby! Ben doesn't look too great. He's drunk again  isn't he? Ben's gonna be fine. Shut the (bleep) up.\nI'll kill you. We're gonna... attack you. Ben  can you walk\nin a straight line? Shut up. Hang up the phone. I don't wanna see him anymore. Recite the alphabet\nbackwards  please. Good luck hanging\non to Massachusetts! He's definitely drunk.\nYeah. Brian  are you excited\nfor more trains? I'm hungry and I'm losing. Alright  you did that\nso fast that we can actually just walk back\nto the train station. That's gonna be good. Because I don't know\nthat you could run right now. While we walk back\nto the train station  it's time to draw a new card! Oh god. Oh  buddy  okay.\nI got them. Alright  you\nwanna draw the top one? That's it.\nWhat is it? That's it. What is it? Spell \"help\" in\nrocks on an island. We can find an island. I bet we could\nfind an island. Travel to a landmass officially\ndesignated as an island. Anywhere on the island  legibly spell the word \"help\" using\nrocks collected from the island. I like this card. Islands aren't that hard to get to. For the most part. Alright  so what we're\ngonna do now is... Here  come get in the frame. Our Amtrak conductor helped\nus out and called Amtrak  and was able to split our ticket\nacross New Haven to Providence  and then Providence to Boston. And these are our special tickets. How you doing?\nWhat is this? Thanks to... Mike and Leon. Thank you. I'm very drunk. I know  I know you are. Alright  I'm gonna\ngo get Ben a bagel. While I do that  I'm just\ngonna hand Ben the camera  and I'm gonna see what he does. Number one  Victory Royale. Yeah  Fortnite  it's time\nto get down  get down. Ten kills on the board\nright now. Just wiped out Tomato Town. That's what— Alright  we gotta\nhead to track two  buddy. We gotta go now  come on. How you doing? Hi. I fought the Acela. Okay  so... we're 20 minutes out\nfrom Boston. We're gonna declare\nthe battle now  so that it starts in 30 minutes \nonce we are in Boston  because we don't have a\nlot of time to wait around  because we have to get\non a flight at 4. So we're gonna call them. I'm putting the\nmicrophone on the camera. Hang on.\nAre we recording? Hey. Gentlemen  we hereby\ndeclare a battle in the great state of Massachusetts. I'm gonna (bleep) kill you. Good bye! Okay  well that was in\na way perfect timing  'cause that came in\nliterally at 1:41  so exactly 30 minutes before\nwe'll get off this train. At least we'll\nbe able to compete. Yes. I'm doing so good  but\nmy hand is really dirty. I don't know how that happened. Welcome to Boston  buddy. What? Welcome to Boston  buddy. We're in Boston.\nI hate Boston. We've already gone over this. I think it's the\nworst city in America. Are we allowed to say that on—? Alright  so we're not\ngonna be in an amazing spot for this battle challenge. They're gonna be\nin downtown Boston. We're gonna be in the\nmiddle of like nowhere. Basically  if we manage\nto pull this off  it would be unbelievably lucky. If we don't— Which we have not\nhad a lot of luck with. Yeah  if we don't  we will\ncontinue our streak of Ls  and we'll be even further behind. And we will leave the East\nCoast with only two states. After two days. Yeah. That's not great. No. I mean  I definitely\nwould not characterize our current state\nin the game as 'great'. There's nothing good\nin this city except for the aquarium  which is okay. Okay  you gotta\ndelete your tweet. Ben did a tweet\nsaying he was drunk. Shut up! Now he has to delete it. Ben's drunk tweeting on\nthe train and giving us info  like confirming that he did\nthe drunk challenge and... This tweet has been deleted. Deleted a tweet. Have a good one.\nThank you. Thank you. Alright. They should call any second now. Alright. 2:11  call 'em. Hello.\nHey guys. Alright  gentlemen. I'm going to draw\nthe battle challenge. You prepared? Alright  are they\nproperly shuffled? They are properly shuffled. Ben  pull the top card.\nWhat is it? Photograph the most birds. Photograph the most birds. You have 15 minutes. All photographed birds\nmust be clearly visible and must be actual birds. You cannot intentionally\nphotograph the same bird twice. Oh god. Photograph the\nmost birds  okay. It's raining and we're\nin the middle of a city  so I'm not feeling\ngood about this. Bird. I mean  where would birds be? They're gonna be water or\nin a city  but they're just gonna get all the\n(bleep) pigeons. Yeah.\n(bleep) Damn it. Okay  there's a bird right\nhere  right in front of us. I have photographed it.\nYou photographed it? Got it. One bird there. Got that bird. Let's keep looking. Look for birds like\nperched on top of things. Oh!\nBird. Bird. Yep  yep  I got it for sure.\nGot it? I mean  I don't\neven see a single bird. Birds aren't even (bleep) real. Yeah  that's true. There's literally\nnot a bird in the sky. Oh  what the (bleep) I hear birds. Oh  wait  wait. Shh. I hear...\nNo  I hear them too. I hear them too.\nWhere are they? Birds. Okay  I got one. There's one right there. What if I kick the tree really hard?\nNo  no  no  no  no! How's there not a\nsingle (bleep) bird? Literally not a single one. (angry groan) Where are you  little (bleep)? Boom  one! So that's nine birds. Oh  that bird. Oh  whoa  whoa! Bird. Got it  that's ten. We are so (bleep).\nI've taken one picture of a bird. There's big bird  big bird there. Just make sure you're\nreally scanning these trees  so you don't miss any. What's your best bird call\nto try to scare 'em away? Ca-caw! That didn't do it. This is hopeless. Ugh. I hate to be so pessimistic \nbut I'm just being realistic. There's a bird!\nBird. Ack!\nBird alert. I don't have\na clear shot of it. Bird alert. Bird alert. Yeah  yeah.\nI got it  I got it  I got it. Sixteen. Sixteen. I mean  we're doing\npretty good  I feel like. What are you at? One.\n(scoffs) Oh  see if the dog\nscares some birds. Oh  there's one. There's one.\nGet it Brian. Get it  Brian. Get it. You got it?\nGot it. You got it?\nGot it. That's two. Nice job  Brian. Wait  there's a second. Oh  that's.\nNo  it's a leaf. False alarm. Hello  there's two pigeons. 18  19  I got them. Oh  there's a bunch\nof birds right there. Bird town. Oh  and I've got him\nin the picture. That's 1  2  3  4th.\nBird central. Oh  there's another one.\nIt's a big eagle. Oh  wow  geez  oh. That's a bald eagle. That should get\nus extra points. That should totally get us—\nThat's a bald eagle. You see that?\nLook at that. It's literally a bald eagle. Ca-caw! Got a god damn bald eagle. Anyway  don't\nget too distracted. We should have... That is literally a bald eagle. It is literally a bald eagle \nbut we need to keep going. Is that a bird or a cup? Oh  that's a bird. That's a bird.\nGot it. What about that bird? Got it. I think that's like around 29. That's three  right? That's three.\nI mean  the bald eagle should be worth...\n(bleep) 50. This is brutal. (moaning sigh) We just cannot... I mean  at this point I'm wondering\nif we're just (bleep) at this game. Let's hustle. Okay  I think\nthere's six more minutes. Okay  we have\nsix minutes left. (bleep) There  there  there.\nBrian  there's a flock. Wait  there's so many over there. Get 'em  get 'em.\nWhere? Get 'em. In the sky \nin the sky  in the sky. Go  go  go  go  go.\nThere's so many  so many. Yes  Sam! Yes! 25  26  27  28  29. I count at least 35. This  we might have— Our luck might have just\nfinally changed  Brian.

        "transcript": "Welcome back to our race\nto claim the most states. You're watching episode three  so go watch the first two episodes\nif you don't want spoilers  or just keep watching if\nyou're freaky like that. Right now  the score\nis three to seven  but Brian and I have a\nplan to make a comeback. At the end of the game \nthe team that's claimed the most area gets\nan extra two points. If we can lock that bonus down  we have a pretty good\nchance to win the game. So we're heading to the pretty\nbig state of Tennessee next  with a plan to continue on to\nthe very big state of Texas. Along the way  we can always try\nto steal Adam and Ben's states by claiming two adjoining\nstates and declaring a battle. And speaking of battles \nwe're in one right now  trying to defend our\nstate of Massachusetts by photographing the\nmost birds in 15 minutes. A battle we have to win \nwhere we've just had our first stroke of good luck. There  Brian  more \nmore  more  there. Go  go  go  go  go. Okay  there's\none  two  three. Is that a bird over there? In the water?\nI can't see. There's more coming. One  two  three. The gods have\nsmiled upon us  Sam. Where are the other ones?\nThere's more. Oh  there  keep coming.\nKeep going. Four  five  six  seven. But I think we just suddenly\ngot up to 60 or something. Surely they can't have\nmore than  what  we have 35. Yeah  we got so many birds. Oh  there's a bunch more. One  two  three  four  five \nsix  seven  eight  nine  ten  11  12  13  14  15 \n16  17  18  19  20. I'm so happy  Sam. This field came in clutch. I love bird watching. Birds  birds  birds  birds. 2:28  okay.\nOkay  okay  time's up. Thank god for\nyour youthful eyes. Oh  here's Adam. Hey boys.\nHello. Hello  gentlemen. We have to double check\nsome of the pictures  but we believe we have\napproximately 35 birds. (vocal fry chuckle)\nYou lose. How many do you have?\nOh  we have... Approximately  like... We're at this field. 150  200. Oh god  okay. Okay  well that's... That is more than 35. I don't think we have\nto tally our birds then. And...\nAnd we got a bald eagle. A bald (bleep) eagle.\nWe got a bald eagle. Ca-caw! I mean  that's \nthat's pretty good  okay. Well (bleep)  okay. Well done  boys. You keep the state... You will keep the state\nof Massachusetts  and it is now locked. Thank god.\nYeah! We finally got something. A bit of luck went our way. We did it. Alright  you\nguys needed that. Oh  look  there's two\nbirds in front of us now. (bleep) Because we had  we\nwere like watching flocks for like ten minutes.\nYeah  there was— Okay  yeah  yeah  we get it. You got a lot of birds.\nOkay  we have to go now. Well  that sucks. So now... New York is vulnerable\nif they get Vermont. If New York goes  then other\nstates become vulnerable as well. So this is quite bad. Choo-choo! Brian  that's the train\nto Vermont that we decided not to get on  I think. Good. We made the right call. I'm positive that they\ncould beat us to Vermont. We are instead sticking with\nthe plan and going to Chicago. Chicago's this way? Chicago's this way. Hi  does this go to terminal C? Yes.\nOkay  thank you. So we have an hour and a half\nuntil the flight to Nashville. I'm booking that  right?\nIt was like 175 bucks each. Yeah. Yeah  I mean \nthis luck turns fast  'cause we wasted their\ntime with Massachusetts. (bleep) It's right there! Oh my god  this (bleep) wasp! This is the first flight that we've taken in a\nlong time for this show. Long time  yeah.\nNo flights last season. No flights last season. First flight of this\nseason for us at least. Look  it's Jet Lag. We promised you some jets. So here we go.\nWe're back at an airport. So what does that mean? They have New York \nConnecticut  Rhode Island. They have six to our three. We can pull  we can come\nback from that  yeah. 7-2 was gonna be  I think  impossible to come back from. Yeah  especially if we get\nthe area bonus. and we're gonna be  yeah \nlike you said  Nashville  it's gonna be easy\nto get to Texas. So anyway  I think our\nUber's almost here. So let's get in that  get to the\nairport  and get on our flight. Made it through security. Ben seems to have\nmostly sobered up. Mostly. Adam  I have a little treat\nfor you for the flight. It's your Pez. Ah  thanks buddy. That's a fun little\ntreat for the flight. America  Sam. We just met him.\nCa-caw! Ca-caw. Let us take you on\na magical journey from Boston to Chicago.\nTale as old as time. It's a journey\nthat people dream of. Yeah. To go from Boston  Massachusetts\nto Chicago  Illinois. This is really some\nfantastical content right here. Bye now! Alright  we have\ntwo hours and 20 minutes. It's a 90 minute drive. We gotta get the rental car. We can pick any of these.\nThe most American one. The Hemi?\nYeah. These are\nterrible cars to drive. Whatever. This one?\nAmerican— yeah. You sure it's the best one?\nYeah. I'm not gonna lie. You do not smell amazing. Do I just smell of BO? Yeah. You need more headroom? ♪ Life na-na highway ♪ ♪ I wanna na-n-it ♪ It's copyrighted music.\nIt's copyrighted music  Sam. Not my cover of it. That is far too\naccurate of a cover for it to not get copyright. Oh  thank you  Brian. (imitates revving) We're literally going  let's see... The entire length \nwe're just on this road. So directions are not needed. 101 miles on this road. That's where Buc-ee's live. To Exit 320.\nAlong boring roads. An hour and a half. That will give us 25 minutes\nto start coming back this way. Well  yeah  but we\nneed purchase stuff too. (bleep) Buc-ee's! Bussy— Buc-ee's! Buc-ee's!\n82 miles away. Welcome to Chicago. Welcome to Canada \naccording to T-Mobile. Not only did they not\nchallenge New York while we were in the air  they\ndidn't even claim Vermont. Or another state. Or any other states  so... What are they doing? Buc-ee's! 27 miles  Brian! Is it up bussys? No  it's Buc-ee's—! Look. Look. Look. Buc-ee's. Buc-ee's.\nLook. Look. Look.\nI'm trying to look. Buc-ee! Brisket. Beavers. Bathrooms? Buc-ee's!\nNext exit. Buc-ee's. Exit now.\nBuc-ee's. Exit now. Right here? Oh  Jesus.\nSlow down. (imitating vroom)\n(bleep) Slow down  Sam! Welcome to sunny \nbeautiful Illinois. We have 45 minutes\nuntil the rest period starts. And in that time  we really need to go pick\nup our Chevy from Avis. It's kinda hard to explain. It's part of like a\nscavenger hunt thing. And I specifically \nit has to be a Chevy. Because we are going to do the\ndrive a Chevy to a levee card. If we can't pick it up and\nget outta the airport before the rest period starts... then I don't know if we're gonna\nbe able to pick it up tomorrow. I forgot how\nconfusing and big— Oh what the hell? What's going on here? That's so many gas pumps! Oh  this is so wholesome\nand totally not problematic in the slightest. I wonder—\nHoly (bleep) Like I don't  I'm not\neven sure this camera's getting the scale of this. There is... Unbelievable. Like 20 gas stations\nworth of pumps here. This is like\nfour times larger than the next largest\ngas station I've ever seen. And get this. This is one of the things\nTexans are most proud of. Here.\nTravel to any Buc-ee's store. Spend at least a hundred dollars. You may exceed this\nnumber by at most $10. Money does not come outta\nyour travel budget  great. It smells like brisket everywhere. Make the selections quickly. Remember  we have to keep\nanything that we buy. Ooh. This goes hard. Oh  that's\nactually really cool. Yeah. It's 20 bucks.\nI'm totally getting that. I'm getting it \nhow can I get one too? Nine bucks  so what are we at? $60. 27 minutes. Bit of a line there at Avis. These are awesome.\nI want one of these. How much is it? It's 13 bucks. Oh  hell yeah. Absolutely. The bib. You have to bring the  you\nhave to wear the bib then. Hey. You all doing okay? Oh  yep. Thank you very much. Let's put as much merch as\nwe can on in the next... in the next minute. Alright  we've\njust received a video. We've received\na video from them. After a long time. It looks like there's a\nBuc-ee's in the background. That doesn't look\nlike Vermont to me. Hello.\nHey guys. Coming to you from\nthe great state of... Tennessee.\nTennessee. Tennessee.\nI didn't know there were Buc-ee's in Tennessee.\nTennessee? Tennessee's interesting. We hope you had a great\nevening at Boston Logan Airport. Yeah  it looked like\nyou had a great time. Yeah and we're gonna \nwe're gonna go get some some dinner  I think.\nMhm. We're done for the day. Bye!\nBye! Tennessee? I did not\nTennessee? expect Tennessee. Why... Why would they go to Tennessee? 18 minutes until\nthe rest period. Wanna see if we can\nmake the most of it? Yep. So I think we should go\nahead and pull a card  see if that impacts\nour plans for tomorrow. Like whether we wanna go\nsouth to Chattanooga or over to Nashville. Right?\nYeah. Okay  same as\nbefore  top card. Yep. Mhm.\nReady? Ineffectively advertise\nJet Lag: The Game. Go to the smallest town in your\nstate and put up a single poster advertising Jet Lag: The Game. The poster does not need to\nbe well made  but it must give the town sufficient\ninformation to watch the channel. See the Smallest Town\nlist for reference. That's all right.\nThat's doable. We can do that in any state. Do we want to drive\ntowards Nashville right now  or do we want to drive\ntowards Chattanooga? I would say towards Nashville. We will want to probably\ngo to Texas or something. Yeah  I think so. Alright  let's make 15\nminutes of progress towards there  and then we can talk\nabout the plan for tomorrow. Thanks very much. Alright  we have like... 10 minutes until the day's over \nand we have to get the car. F15. That's J. It should be F after G  right? E  F  G?\nOh  F. F? Oh  F. F15. No. That is not a Chevy. (hollow sigh) Okay  so tomorrow morning \nwe're currently driving back towards Nashville  assuming that\nwe'd probably grab a flight. We're just not really\nsure to where yet. We know we can go to Texas. I'm not confident that we could\nget a flight until like 10. And I think the next\nflight to Texas after that was not until like 11. So we'd kind of lose an hour. But we'll have time to research\nall of this in the morning. I'm gonna take this exit. I think this will be our spot. There's people up here. Okay. Worst case scenario \nI guess we just cancel it. This is a very stupid problem  but we had to rent this car\nas part of a scavenger hunt that we're doing  and specifically\nwe have to be driving a Chevy. Are there any Chevrolets\nthat we can get instead  of any make or model? In Quincy-eight  alright? Incredible \nthank you so much. No problem. Alright  well \nthat was sorted out much faster than I expected. That was kind of a miracle. That was incredible. Look for Q. R. I forget how the alphabet goes. Yes! That's a Chevy  baby. Alright  let's hurry  hurry  hurry. How long do we have? We have seven minutes. Okay. This is gonna be our spot. Right here? Yeah  around this\ndisused gas station. How about that?\nThis is spooky  Sam. This is really spooky. Okay  well  on the map  this\nis marked as Septic Solutions. (shivering) (hissing sigh) We might be about to die. It's 8 pm.\nWe are— We did not make\nit to the McDonald's. We're at this intersection.\nWe're at this intersection. We will figure out a way to be\nexactly here at 8 am tomorrow. 7 am. 7 am  7 am  sorry. 7 am Central  8 am Eastern. Ugh. It is 7 am. We are at the exact same\nintersection we were at 8 pm last night. And we are headed to... the levee. The way that this card works \nwe have to be in a Chevy  we have to drive up to a levee \nand we have to eat pie. Yes. We bought pie at\nthe Boston Logan Airport. Boston Cream Pie secured. We actually bought\ntwo kinds of pie  'cause one of them\nturns out wasn't really pie. And now I also\nhave key lime pie. Just so that no one\ncan get mad at me. Yeah  we bought\nBoston cream pie  which it turns out is a cake. So we also have \nwhat  it's key lime pie? Right  well  I got rid\nof the Boston cream pie  so now we only have\nkey lime pie. We have some key lime pie. That's definitely a pie. Sam just learned how to\nrev the engine before starting. I had to teach him  'cause he's\nonly ever driven electric cars. Okay  go  go  go  go. Wait  don't die \ndon't die  don't die. We haven't heard\nfrom them like since our battle challenge yesterday. So we have no idea where in\nthe country they could be. I am worried they're in Texas. If we don't get Texas \nwe have to go to Alaska  'cause we're so far behind. And Alaska will take so much\ntime that it will give them time to get states down here. And at that point we've lost. Oh my god. Ben  that's the\nlevee right there. That's the famed\nlevee from the song. Not really. Okay.\nThat's a levee though. That's the levee.\nLevee seven. There was a sign. If anyone doesn't know \nthis card is a reference to the song \"American Pie\"  where they took a Chevy to a\nlevee  but the levee was dry. Which actually \njust by the way  a levee isn't a body\nof water  it's a wall. So you actually want\nyour levee to be dry. That actually is good. We took a Chevy\nto the levee... And the levee... is dry. The levee is dry \nthat's true. This pie traveled in my backpack\nfrom the Boston Airport  and it did not travel well  baby. It's still pie. Bon appetit. My stomach is usually\npretty unsettled in the morning  and there's nothing better\nthan eating a whole slice of key lime pie for that. I don't even\nlike key lime pie. No  me neither. If they didn't try to go to Texas \nthey made the wrong move. Which I don't— they're\nboth smart lads. I don't think they would've. Yeah  and they know\nabout the area bonus. That makes me think\nwe should go to Vegas. Oh  I got a red thing. I think that's from\nthe Boston cream pie that was in here before. Soon we will own the\ngreat state of Illinois. Afterwards  we still\nhave our rental car. We still have our Chevy. And we have three power-ups.\nAnd we have three power-ups. We can use one of those\npower-ups to unlock the border\nwith Indiana  which is right nearby \nand drive our Chevy right into Indiana... and do a challenge\nand claim Indiana. The one we are\nthinking of doing is go to the most beautiful\nplace in Indiana  which is what? Indiana Dunes National Park. And that is not too far\nfrom where we are right now. This is the last bite. We have claimed Illinois! Alright  let's go call Sam\nand Brian from the Chevy  'cause it's so cold here. I want to go\naway from the levee. These are trippy\n(bleep) clouds. Maybe it's not clouds. Maybe it's like a\ntoxic gas thing. I'm starting to wonder. We just got a video\nfrom Ben and Adam. We need that info  but\nthat also meant that they claimed a state very quickly. Yeah.\n42 minutes in. Which like  I thought\nwe'd established what was going to happen.\nProbably  but... We're pretty sure they're\nin a car  they're driving. We just watch it?\nYeah. Hello gentlemen. We come to you from\nthe great state of... Illinois  good\nmorning from Illinois. It's very cold\nhere in Illinois. That is... I imagine  much colder\nthan it is in Tennessee  or wherever it is\nthat you are. That is great news. What do we want to tell them? Suck it. I think Ben put\nit best— suck it. When did Ben get so mean? Since yeah. It's Dark Ben. Dark Ben is here.\nDark Ben. I'm honestly  I'm\nhere for team Dark Ben. I think that is good  because\nThat's great. that means we can get Texas  and then we can\nprobably get to Vegas  which gets us a big state.\nWe can get to California. We can speedrun\nall of these today. Yeah  I think so. The only bad news is that \nwe talked about this yesterday. They're in an area with a bunch\nof close bordering states. Yeah. And some public\ntransit between them. So they're probably gonna be\nable to get like Wisconsin and... Let 'em have it. And Michigan and all that. Let them have it. But we're gonna have\na great head start for the area about us.\nYeah. Now it is time\nto pull another card. Our next card is... ...whatever it says on this. Shoot a bullseye. Okay  shoot a bullseye. This is interesting \nit's a pretty flexible one. We can do it in a lot of places. Let's officially use our\npower-up to unlock the border between Illinois and Indiana. We are on our way to\nIndiana Dunes National Park. Here we go. At the airport. Look  planes. Ooh (bleep) Look at that. I love planes.\nI like planes too. Almost as much as I love trains. I think I love planes more. You love planes\nmore than trains? Yeah. I'm gonna send the\n\"not just bikes\" hit squat after you. They won't be able to go very\nfast  'cause they'll be on bikes. They'll be on bikes. We're getting Texas.\nTexas is huge. Texas could win us the game. And it puts pressure\nunder them to... To waste time to go to Alaska.\nYeah. It's the right play. if we didn't get \nif they were getting  if they got Texas this morning  we'd be having a\nvery different morning. They're gonna be getting\nall these little boi states  you know  like Wisconsin. Welcome to Indiana. Crossroads of America. Crossroads of America  baby. Here's a question. Where do you think that Sam\nand Brian are headed next? They're in the middle \ndead middle of Tennessee. I'm putting in\nmy guess as Kentucky. Kentucky's not a bad guess. Because Kentucky\ntouches Illinois. They're behind.\nSo if they want to win  they need to start attempting\nto steal some of our states. I think that's their only chance. Yeah. I don't think that they\ncan outrun us at this point. I think they have to\ngo for some steals. And right now they're\nnot winning the area bonus. No  we're winning\nthe area bonus. Alright  Southwest \nsouth terminal  left. Ready to go home? For two hours? Is it even two hours? Probably an hour in Austin \nand an hour in the airport. Yeah.\nYeah. What is that ball? Someone in the comments \ntell me what that ball does. You guys are smarter. Don't tell people\nin comments  \"Tell me what that ball does.\" Tell me what that ball does. There's a big— People are gonna\ntake that the wrong way. This guy makes sexy teeth. What? Indiana Dunes.\nWe are almost there. We're almost to\nthe state park. National park.\nThe national park. The national park. National Park  but we're not\ngonna do the National Parks card. We're gonna do most\nbeautiful place  'cause I wanna save the\nNational Parks card. There are 63 national parks  and we're now getting to the\nregions where a lot of them are. So I think it gives\nus more flexibility. We have arrived at\nthe Visitors Center for the Indiana Dunes National Park. Can I just get\na National Parks pass? Thanks very much. Have a nice day.\nYou too. Okay  well\nwe've got our passes. The people said that we\nshould go see Mount Baldy. Hopefully it'll be very pretty. I think the drive\nwill be very scenic  but we have to come with\nthings we don't like about it. Yeah  we're gonna say some\nvery mean things about Mount Baldy. And we're sorry that\nwe have to do that  but that's what the card says. That's what the card says. And we didn't— well \nwe wrote the card  but... We wrote the card. There's the sign. We're entering\nthe national park. Dunes  dunes  dunes  dunes \ndunes  dunes  dunes  dunes  dunes  dunes  dunes  dunes! Alright  I mean \nwe're in the national park  so I'll go ahead\nand say the first thing that I hate about the\nnational park is that it's seemingly very hard\nto get to the part that's cool. Like this is a national\npark right now  and it's just very normal looking roads \nand it has been for a while. Unimpressed. But that's okay.\nThat's number one. Mount Baldy is up ahead. Is this our left? Is it this? No  no. Keep going. You're sure?\nYes  I'm sure. There's a big sign\npointing to Mount Baldy. We're back in the national park.\nWe took a wrong turn. We almost went somewhere that\nwe were not allowed to go. Oh? Now we're talking. I'm seeing a big dune. Ooh  that looks\npretty dune-y to me. Okay. Trail to beach \nor summit. Okay. Okay. Actually  this is a\ngreat place to show... the second main thing\nwe have to say about it  which is you see these trees\ngetting eaten by Mount Baldy? So the woman at the visitor\ncenter  she said that Mount Baldy moves a lot  and it's always\nmoving all around  and that they're worried that it's\ngonna crush these buildings here  because it's already\neating these trees. So... That's the second thing\nwe hate about the most beautiful place\nin Indiana. Yeah. Here we go  trail to beach. I've never had to hike\nto get to a beach. This is pretty nice. Yeah  this is a lovely trail. Show everyone the trail. Very peaceful. Dunes  dunes  dunes \ndunes  dunes  dunes! Seems we are\napproaching the lake  Ben. Oh  here we go. Dunes  dunes  dunes  dunes. Oh  oh  I think this\nis gonna be a cool view. Cool view alert! Oh  and it is cool! Got a nice little\nnuclear plant over there. Very classy. I gotta admit  these\ndunes are cooler. These dunes are cooler\nthan I expected  I'll be honest. But we're not supposed to\nsay something nice about 'em. Yeah  yeah. Okay  here. Third thing don't like\nabout the national park. There's a giant power\nplant in the background. Yeah  that sucks. Pretty cool.\nWhat do you have to say? I've never seen\nLake Michigan before. And I think it's beautiful. And I think it should be\nupgraded to the ocean. You think Lake Michigan\nshould get upgraded to be being allowed to\nbe an ocean? Well  let's call Sam and Brian. No answer.\nNo answer. Let's send him a video. Let's get back to the car \nlet's pull another card  and let's figure out if\nwe want to go to Michigan. Yeah. If you have oversized\nitems  please check— They just called. We have to go\nupstairs for Uber. Okay.\nThese stairs. Oh  we have video. You're recording  right?\nHell yeah. Hello  Sam and Brian. As you can by the tropical\nbeach that we are sending you this video from \nwe are in the great state of... Indiana! Indiana. Great  okay. The crossroads\nof the country. And the... well  what? What is it?\nThe Hoosier— I'm not watching the rest\nof video  we don't have time. We're about to get the area bonus. Our new card is... (laughs uproariously) That's gonna be a tough one. Go sky diving. That's gonna be a tough one. Put it into the hand.\nWow. Put it into the hand. Now we have to decide\nwhat we're gonna do next. We're not too far\nfrom Michigan. We could use another\npower-up to unlock the border\nwith Michigan. So in terms of things\nwe could do in Michigan  I mean  maybe we\ncould go sky diving. Maybe. There is a law from\nCrime Spree in the state of Michigan. It is... seduce and debauch\nan unmarried woman. So we might have to\nget creative about how to achieve that. Yeah.\nMhm. Came all the way here for it. Thank you very much.\nHave a good one. Alright  we've made it\nto the Promised Land. The Promised Land of In-N-Out. I feel like someone\nI know is gonna see me. Eat at In-N-Out. Travel to\nany In-N-Out restaurant. Both team members must consume the\nentirety of at least one menu item. Do you know what you want? No  I don't. Well hurry up \n'cause we gotta be quick. I'll just get a cheeseburger. Hi  can we get\ntwo cheeseburgers? Two cheeseburgers?\nYep. Okay  so we're gonna go\nahead and we're gonna contact the judge from Crime Spree \nwhere this map originates  and we're gonna ask him... what he would think was sufficient. Sufficient to seduce\nand debauch a woman. Seduce and debauch a woman. Let's see if he answers. Oh hey  buddy! Hey! What's up dogs?\nYou running from the law? What are you up to? So JT  we're playing a game. One of the cards is we have\nto break one of the unbroken laws from Crime Spree. Can you pull up the\nexact statute  Ben? Okay  seducing and debauching\nan unmarried woman is illegal. Any man who shall seduce and\ndebauch any unmarried woman shall be guilty of a felony.\nAlright. So ins— how—\nI guess the question is  what would you consider\ndebauching? Now  debauching is not\na word I typically use in my day-to-day life  so that's a— Sure. So debauch is defined as... Corrupting the moral.\nCorrupting the moral purity of. So we were thinking\nif we could just get them to sin in any way... Would that count? I would say so \nbut the caveat there is it would have to be new to them \nto besmirch their purity. Okay  so you're saying\nwe have to get them to commit a sin they\nhaven't committed before? Correct. Okay. Hmm. I'm making this\ndifficult for you boys. No  that's fair.\nNo  that's fair. Alright  thanks buddy. Bye JT. Bye  boys.\nGood luck. Okay. Let's  I think \nlet's go to Michigan. We're only like\n17 minutes from. Yeah  we're like\n17 minutes from Michigan. We are gonna use another\nstate unlock power-up. We are now unlocking the border\nbetween Indiana and Michigan. We're gonna drive to Michigan \ngonna get on the dating apps  and we'll see how well we\ncan do in terms of getting... an unmarried woman to commit a sin\nthat she has not committed before. We will see you in Michigan. Okay  so... We're still waiting for our\nburgers  but basically we don't know what our next part\nis  but we need to decide between Vegas and California. Because that's like\nthe two good options. 371. That's us. Okay  you ready to\nabsolutely demolish this? Yes. Wanna race?\nWe can talk and eat. So... The thing about California is that\nit would really help solidify the area bonus  because it's massive. Mhm. Nevada would too \nNevada's very big  but California's the\nsecond largest state. And forcing them  making\nit clearer that we have the area bonus advantage would\nforce them to be a little bit more aggressive and maybe\ngo for Alaska for example  which would waste\na ton of their time. They would need to use like all\nof tomorrow to get to Alaska. I mean  I'm pretty sure if we\nwent to Vegas and literally just walked into a bunch of\nthe different helicopter tour places  there are a bunch\nof them  they all do like 15 minute flights and just saying \nwhat's your next one available? Mhm. We would need\nto acquire a soup. In getting a soup— oh \nI need to eat  you talk. I wanted to finish first. You want papa to help you eat? Eat  you need to finish. What is a bad thing we could\nmake someone do on Tinder? This is someone who doesn't\nknow us  doesn't trust us. Right. We also don't wanna be creepy. Like we don't wanna— No  but we have to get\nsomeone to do something bad that they've never done before. And we need proof\nthat they'd do it. What are sins? What are examples of sins? Can we look that up? Could we have them commit\narson at a very small level? At a very small level? Could we have\nsomeone commit fraud? Could they steal\nat a very small level? Could have them say a curse word\nthat they've never said before. But JT said\ncursing was a cop out. Most people have\nnever scammed someone. Ah-huh. Could they scam us? Could they scam?\nDoes that count? Well  I think the problem\nis if they do something bad to us \nwe want them to do it. So I don't know if it's a sin. Could we  maybe if they\ncan't do something bad to us  maybe they could do\nsomething bad to Sam and Brian. Yeah  that would work. Could they like spread\nmisinformation about them? They could spread\nmisinformation about Sam and Brian on social media. Because I'm sure that\nthey've lied before  but like spreading social... Spreading misinformation  right? Like slandering someone. So that's definitely. Slander is definitely a sin. Ooh  okay! We're good  this works.\nI think this works. Can you look up  just for like\na joke on camera  can you look up the area of Cal— the area of Texas\nand get like the number exactly. So I can be like \n\"We just got Texas \" and I'll be like \n\"Brian  you're from here. Do you happen to know\nhow big Texas is?\" And then you give like\nthe precise number. 695 663 kilometers squared. We need miles. Do we?\nWe're in America. I'm not American though. 268 597. Hundred. 268 thousand. 268 597. 268... 597. 268  597. You calling them right now? Yeah. Here  look up. Let's go outside and\ncall the Uber too. Still nothing\nfrom Sam and Brian. Not a word! We don't know\nwhere they're going. What could they be doing? We don't know\nwhat their plan is. I mean... Look  Sam is the type of\nperson that has a plan always. But I just like struggle... Oh. Brian just called. Uh-oh. Okay. Well  never mind. Oh. Oh  here he is. Hello gentleman. Oh hey  Ben. Hello. Hey guys. We just had a delicious\nmeal at some local burger establishment in... That's a state that has\n268 597 square miles area. Known as... Alaska. What  where are they? Texas!\nTexas! Where are you?! What state are you in?! I can't hear you.\nI can't hear you. Texas is ours  mother-(bleep)! What state are you in?\nCalifornia? Texas. Texas.\nTexas. Texas  Texas  okay. You're screwed.\nTexas. Good bye!\nBye. Bye! Well  that puts them in\nthe lead for the area bonus. They're presumably\ngoing for the area bonus  and that might put them... Yeah  I mean  if we\ndon't get Alaska. Okay. Wait  wait  wait  wait. Okay  so now  it was nine to four. Now it's nine to five. They're in the lead for the\narea bonus  so it's like... Nine to seven. Provisionally  it's\nnine to seven right now. Oh. Yeah. They're catching up. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Okay  so in all these ad reads  I always talk about why you\nshould totally sign up for Nebula  'cause you can watch every\nsingle episode of Jet Lag one week early and ad free.\nAnd while that's totally still true  you totally still should\nsign up for Nebula for that. Clearly you haven't\nbeen convinced yet  so I'm gonna give you 150\nother reasons to sign up  and it's all of these faces and\nlogos and everything behind me. 'Cause these are all of the\nother creators on Nebula  and they're all making\nreally fantastic stuff. For example  here's Joseph. You know  our season\ntwo guest  RealLifeLore. He makes this awesome series\ncalled Modern Conflicts. It goes into how these modern\nwars and battles have gone down  really getting nitty gritty \nshowing actual footage  doing all this stuff that\nyou can't do on YouTube because of their advertising\nguidelines and stuff. There's also Battle of Britain.\nThis is a series by Brian. You might recognize him\nfrom this season of Jet Lag. It's about the Battle of Britain. It's just about the highest\nproduction value thing I've ever seen come out\nof an internet creator. It's awesome. It's amazing.\nYou should totally watch it. Night of the Coconut \nthis one's also awesome. It's by Patrick Willems.\nHe's a film creator. He makes fantastic stuff  and in\nthis  it's really hard to describe. It's about a interdimensional \ngenocidal coconut. That's all you need to know. That  and the fact that it's\nlike genuinely fantastic. I went to the premiere. I'd never really watched this channel\nbefore that  but this was so much fun. I totally recommend it \neven if you have zero idea what the Patrick Willems\nuniverse is about. Oh  here's another new one: That Time When\nwith Anita Sarkeesian. It's about moments when history\nand pop culture have converged. Also  super high production value. I mean  we're also adding\nnew creators all the time. For example  that's Johnny Harris. He's new on Nebula. He's posting videos\nright now early on Nebula. It's awesome. And you know what makes\nall this worth it even more is the best way to sign up \nbecause there's this crazy deal. Honestly  I'm surprised\nthat it is a deal  but when you go to\nCuriosity Stream  Curiosity Stream is partnered with\nNebula to offer a bundle deal.

        "transcript": "Welcome back to our race\nto claim the most states. This is episode four  and right now \nwe're halfway through day three. The game will end at\n11 pm EST tomorrow  and whichever team has\ncompleted a challenge in the most states by that point\nwill win the game. Right now  the game is tightening. Brian and I have\nbegun to cut into Ben and Adam's lead\nby claiming Texas  which puts us in the lead\nfor the two-point bonus for the team that\nclaims the most area. That means the score is 7-9  but Ben and Adam are hoping to\nmake it 7-10 by claiming Michigan  which they can do by breaking\none of Michigan's strangest laws: it is a felony to seduce and\ndebauch an unmarried woman. You know what?\nLet's find somewhere to eat. While we while we're eating \nwe'll work on a dating profile. Should we— Let's call—\nlet's give JT a call  and just confirm that he\nthinks this works. Hey buddy. Okay. If we got them to spread\nmisinformation online about Brian... Would that count as corrupting\ntheir— corrupting them? That is a crime  absolutely. You have my full support. Okay  thanks JT. We need to pull another card  and then we need to\ndecide whether we're flying to Vegas or to California. Our Uber is four minutes away. Top card as always. Oh (bleep)  wait.\nI didn't see it. It's alright  we'll reshuffle. Find a four-leaf clover as a leprechaun.\nOh for (bleep) sake. At least one team member must\nbe dressed as a leprechaun. The costume may be makeshift \nis open to creative interpretation. That one's pretty good  I think  because we can do that\nin a lot of places. And it gets us a power-up. Okay. We just need to go to\na Spirit Halloween again to get a leprechaun suit.\nAnd go back to DC? Okay  that's good. So question maintains: California or Vegas? I think Vegas  'cause it's\ncloser  it gives us more time. It's not  it doesn't have a\nreal difference in flight time. Does that not?\nNo  it won't— Then I would say \njust to guarantee... I don't know what we\ncan do in Vegas tonight. Yeah  I think we\nshould do California. California.\nLock it in? Lock it in.\nAlright. I'm really glad we have Texas. That was just\nthree points right there. Yeah. We needed that.\nWe went from 4 to 7. As long as we can\nmaintain the area bonus. Which I think... hopefully we can.\nHopefully. Hey  for Sam. Hey  how's it going? Okay. Alright. I think it's time to seduce and\ndebauch and unmarried woman. Here's my Tinder. This is a photo of me that\nwe took for a thumbnail. But... my mom said it was a\nreally good photo of me. Gonna set my age preference\nfrom 18 to 100+. We're just gonna go \nwe're gonna go fast. Keep swiping right.\nCan we do a boost? Can we spend Sam's money\non a boost? What's the boost do? It just puts you at the top. Oh  totally. Or it's  what's a super boost? It's $70. But it's only $40\nfor three hours. But we would get up to a\nhundred times more views. Great. Thank you.\nAwesome. Thank you very much.\nVery much  thank you. It's gonna be a lot of\nplane time today. Apologies to the audience.\nWe haven't really done anything. We have not...\nPlane  in and out. I hope Ben and Adam are\nbeing entertaining right now. Sam  I'm spending\n40 of your dollars on a super boost\non my Tinder profile. Swipe  swipe  swipe.\nSo we're just gonna— We just have to\ngo insane on the swipes. Alright  we've finished\nlunch at Jackie's Cafe. Delicious.\nWonderful. Let's go seduce and\ndebauch an unmarried woman. Alright. Someone has already\nmessaged us. Ooh  okay. Here's my message to Alexis: \"Okay  this is gonna sound\nweird  but I'm a YouTuber. It's called Jet Lag: The Game. And I am in Michigan to\nbreak a very archaic law about corrupting the morals\nof an unmarried woman. Would you be interested in\nvery  very quickly helping me out by tweeting something lol?\" You're covering your microphone. Oh (bleep) Would I respond to this\nmessage? I don't know. This is gonna (bleep) up my\nTinder for a very long time. (laughs uproariously) I'm so nervous.\nI was really nervous. I'm more—\nI'm so nervous! Any response from Alexis yet? No  she has unmatched us. Oh  Alexis has unmatched us. Alexis has unmatched us. Let's see if anyone\nelse responds. Shea has hit us with a\nquestion mark  which is okay. Kiki says  \"I think you might need to\nrecenter your goals on dating apps.\" So true. I think you gotta\nkeep sending it out. I've sent it to everyone. Oh  to everyone\nyou've matched with? I will be honest  this is taking\nlonger than I thought it would. I'm gonna look at\nour other cards. Lumia has responded. Oh  great. She says she would\nmake a TikTok. \"Would you mind calling me\nand explaining it better?\" Absolutely.\nAbsolutely. (pecking dial tone) Hello?\nHello. Before we do anything \nis it okay if we film this call? We just wanna make\nsure it's okay. Sure.\nOkay. Okay  hi. My name is Ben. This is Adam.\nHi  I'm Adam. If you spread misinformation\nabout our friend Brian by making a TikTok\nlying about him... Because we asked\nyou to do that  we will have debauched you by making you\ndo something bad. Technically.\nTechnically. And that will allow us to\nclaim the state of Michigan. And we know\nthis sounds insane. We know this sounds\ninsane and we're very sorry. Honestly  I was like  I'm not\ngonna lie  but I don't mind doing it. Yes. Thanks for being incredible.\nThank you. This would help us so much.\nIt would help us so much. So all you have to do is \non any social media platform  just say the thing\nthat we sent you. Gimme a second.\nOkay. Okay  you are the best. We appreciate it so much. Oh hey— this number. Oh yeah  we just got it.\nOh  we got it. Oh  incredible! Thank you so much. Thank you so much.\nYou are the best. You've just gotten us Michigan! Yes! Good luck  guys. Thank you  bye!\nBye! Alright  let's watch the TikTok. Brian McManus from\nReal Engineering is not Irish. It's actually all an act. He's English. Yes!\nHa-haa! Yeah! That— Alright  that is\nMichigan claimed baby. That is a woman debauched. Alright  now that we have seduced and debauched\nan unmarried woman... It's time to draw a new card. Here's the deck. Okay. Our next card is to\nforge great American art. I don't know how close\nwe'd be to any museums. But we can do that\nin a lot of places. I think that we should\nstart driving to O'Hare. Okay.\nAnd figure it out on the way. Okay  we're gonna\nhead towards O'Hare  and we're gonna\njust figure out where we're going\nnext on the way. Alright  Brian  we have\n15 minutes until we board. Let's make a plan for what\nwe do at the other end. Yeah  do we wanna\nlook into stealing Texas? I think trying to steal Texas\nis too risky  just 'cause... we wouldn't know what states\nthey're gonna go to next. Where are they gonna\ngo after Texas? New Mexico would make\na lot of sense. Colorado would make\na lot of sense. Arizona would make\na lot of sense. Utah would make\na lot of sense. Yeah  yeah. Let's very quickly\nexplain our plan. Okay. So  Las Vegas... is right here in\nthis part of Nevada. There's a very good flight\nfor us to Las Vegas that gets us in before\nthe end of tonight. Vegas is very close\nto both Utah  Arizona  and also kind of California. All of which are big states\nand all of which are states that we have challenges\nthat we can complete in. So we are going to fly\nto Las Vegas  and hopefully... that should win us the game if we can execute on\neverything properly tomorrow. You ready for this? Are you ready for it? Oh yeah.\nYou dirty leprechaun. Okay  no time to explain. No time to explain. But we've got a plan \nand if the plan pans out  this could be what\nwins us the game. Okay  we need to get out. Through the magic of voiceover \nthere's now time to explain. Here's the plan. First off  we claim California\nas quickly as possible with the one card that\nmight be fast enough: find a four-leaf clover while\ndressed as a leprechaun. But it's a risk. There's a Spirit Halloween\nnear the airport  which we can get to\non scooters  but we'll need the luck of\nthe Irish if we're gonna find a four-leaf clover in time. In time for what you ask? Well  if we can claim\nCalifornia fast enough  we can sprint back to the airport to get a flight to Las Vegas\nbefore the rest period. Then tomorrow morning \nwe can drink soup in a helicopter as it takes off from\nLas Vegas  Nevada  then ride in that helicopter\nto the Grand Canyon in Arizona  allowing us to knock out\nboth of these cards  claim Nevada and Arizona  and get four power-ups before\nthe morning's even over. But none of it's possible if we\ndon't find the clover in time to make our flight to Vegas  which leaves in just 80 minutes. I should have changed\ninto shorts in a (bleep) bag. I'm not tired. I'm (bleep) too hot!\nI'm not wearing shorts. Let's go  let's go  let's go!\nMy balls are hot! Step one... We're recording  right?\nYeah. Step one  find scooters. We gotta go this way because\nthey're not allowed within LAX  but we looked at the map already \nand there are scooters there. The next 30 minutes\nare make or break. Okay  goodbye to the Chevy Tahoe. Okay  got the scooter. I'm not sure whether we'll\nbe able to film on these  'cause they're already\nskitchy enough as they are. Hopefully Brian has one. Where is it  Sam? Where is it? Here  how about you\nstay with the scooters? I'll go in here. Take my bag. It should just be a minute. I'm so sweaty. Excuse me.\nHi. Do you know if you\nhave a leprechaun costume? I have not seen a\nleprechaun costume here. Okay.\nI haven't. I'll look around  thank you. This line... Sam just texted me saying\nthat the line is really long. I told him to tell him\nthat his son is dying  and that he needs a leprechaun\ncostume before he dies. Got it?\nOkay. They didn't exactly have\na leprechaun costume  I asked. But they have this. (wheezes) So you want me to\nbe the leprechaun? Yes.\nOkay. Did you get a whip? I did not get a whip  Brian. I'm very glad I'm not\ndegrading myself by... letting down my entire country\nby dressing up as a leprechaun. Gotta hurry up  Sam. Oh  we do  Brian? Yeah.\nIs there a rush? Oh  I didn't know that  Brian.\nThanks for letting me know. (bleep) hell. I don't see a single clover  Sam. There's not a single\nclover in that grass. There  there  there. Are they clovers? Those are clovers for sure. So psychotic. Here's one. Oh \nI found one. I found one. Is that four? Oh my (bleep)! That is actually a— I did not think\nwe were gonna get it. Look at that.\nThat is 100% four— Count it  count it \ncount it  count it. Look  wait. Oh  is it just  no! One. (bleep)\nThat's not. (wheezes) Keep going. Wait  keep looking there.\nThose were good ones though. This one  this one  this one. Is it? No  that's three again. These ones are\nsuch little (bleep) Who wrote this—\nWait  wait! Look at this. What do you think?\nI think that's one. It's got four things on it. We need to leave in\nlike five minutes. ♪ We look like lunatics ♪ Oh  oh! That is 100%. Oh wait. Now \nis that a clover? Yeah. Brian  you can't crush\nour ticket to victory. That's four leaves. I say we call 'em  Sam. Are we sure\nthat's a clover? No  but it's four leaves\nand it's among clovers. Should we call Ben and\nAdam to see if we can judge? Yeah. The adrenaline. Our flight—\n(bleep) pick up! Let's take defined photos. We'll send it to them for\nsecondary adjudication. Brian  hold your hand steady. Trying to. Okay. Here  we will send these\nto Ben and Adam for secondary adjudication. We provisionally have California. Provisionally. We are sending this for\nsecondary adjudication to have it verified by them. We believe we have done it. I hope we've done it. I really hope we've done it. Let's go to the airport.\nWe've got a flight to catch. (grumbling) We're gonna make this through\nthe power of positive thinking  right? By the power of the\n(bleep) bald eagle  I'm gonna win this (bleep) game. I think they're on a plane \nbut I texted them the photos. I just wanna figure out\nis California's ours! I'm gonna say it's ours. Oh  there they are.\nThere they are. They're calling us. You look at the photos? Did you look at the photos? We are attempting\nto load the photos. Keep running  keep running. That kind of looks like—\nThat— yeah  yeah. Yeah  I'll accept that.\nThat's a four leaf clover. I see four leaves. Yeah yeah  I'll accept that. They say they're accepting it. Yes! We (bleep) did it  Sam. California's ours!\nHoly (bleep) We are so (bleep) ready.\nCalifornia! California. Okay. That's a big ol' state\nyou got there. California. Alright. Okay  bye guys. We gotta go. Love you. Bye!\nOh my god  Sam. It's the power of the bald eagle.\nWe (bleep) did it  buddy. It's the power of the bald eagle. I can't believe we pulled that off. I'm gonna have to\nchange T-shirts. I really hope I'm not sitting\nnext to you on the plane this time. We're gonna do this  Brian. Can you see how\ndisappointed Adam was? We're (bleep) animals  Sam!\nWe're gods among men! Adam gave a really\ndisappointed  \"Oh.\" What did you drop? Oh  it's your mic! I'm sorry  Graham. Okay  so this completely\nchanges our plans. We believe that we can claim\nNevada before they can. I'm guessing they're\nheaded to Nevada. But they can't be\nanywhere close. They couldn't have\nflown in anywhere close. Like they're probably in LA or... I don't think that\nthey can beat us there. I'd be very surprised if they could. We can do forge great American\nart 22 minutes from the airport. We're gonna have to really hustle. We can hopefully pull that\noff before the rest period. The problem is if we don't\npull it off before the rest period  the gallery will be closed at 5 am\nPacific when the game restarts. So we'll be in trouble there. But then we've gotta\nclaim Arizona immediately  so that we can battle\nfor California. I think that's the obvious move. Yeah. In terms of things\nwe could do in Arizona... We don't have any perfect options. Not a lot of great options. I mean  honestly... Probably either shoot a bullseye... Or we could go to\nthe Grand Canyon. But it's a little far and\nit's in the wrong direction. But one thing we can do is\nwe still have two power-ups. We can swap cards with\nthem  which will— We're going to. Which will hopefully screw them and get us something\nthat we can do quickly. It's getting interesting. I (bleep) love the LAX speedrun. Nice  look at that. That's a gloriously short\nsecurity line. Unbelievable job. Great  we don't need\nto board yet  wait. They're still boarding  but\nwe can draw another card. And we have a power-up. So let's draw a card and then decide\nwhether we wanna use a power-up. I pull it. Let's see. Make s'mores over an open fire.\nThat's easy  that's easy. Yeah  I think we have to—\nYeah  that's easy  okay  great. I think we should try to disrupt\ntheir plans with a power-up  'cause we'll get them for\nsure tomorrow morning  right? Okay  so I think\nwe need to give them ship this card and build a snowman. Yeah. Okay  let me notify them. We want to get the cards pulled. 'Cause we could trip 'em right now.\nYeah. We might actually win this. Okay  we've been informed\nthat they want to swap with us. The thing is  we're just\ngonna swap right back  so... Okay  they have given us... Alright  fair enough. Ship this card and build a snowman. Yeah. We can't do those things. Yeah  fair enough. They send? Yeah  go sky diving. Touch both oceans. Touch both oceans. Forge American art's pretty easy. Top tier carnival\nwe gave them earlier. Clean—\nClean a national park. Shoot a bullseye.\nSpell help on an island. Let's take spell help on an island \nforge American arts. We can do either of those\npretty much anywhere. So  forge art  spell help? Okay. Alright  they have chosen to steal\nspell help and forge art. So let's immediately swap back. No  I want them to\nmake a decision based on what they\nthink they have. Let's give 'em 15 minutes  and then we'll swap back. What do you wanna give them? I think we should\ngive them the oceans. Oceans and give them... I want to keep snowman if\nwe wanted to go to Alaska. Yeah. Snowman one's— I'll give 'em oceans and\nI'll give them back ship the card. Yeah. Okay  we have just\nlanded in Las Vegas  so it is time to inform\nthese dopes that we are swapping\nright back. You'll receive\ntouch both oceans... and mail— and ship this card. If we do this swap and then\nwe don't manage to forge the art \nthat'd be pretty bad. We really just need to get\noff this plane quickly. Their cards are: ineffectively\nadvertise in a small town  make s'mores  helicopter \nGrand Canyon  build raft. Okay.\nHelicopter... There's a helicopter.\nThere's a helicopter. From Vegas to the Grand Canyon. Yeah  that's true. Grand Canyon.\nWe can go to the Grand Canyon. We would get two power-ups.\nThat might be useful later. The question is just  I think\nthey're gonna be racing for Arizona too \nand we want back art. I mean  do we want the\nislands one or not? I think we want it\njust to take it from them. Just to take it from them? Yeah  'cause clearly they\nwanted it for some reason. So just take back the\ntwo that they stole. They taxied in great time. They did. Seven minutes. Less than that  six minutes.\nThat was amazing. The thing we are attempting\nto do in Las Vegas before the end of the day is forge great American art.\nThank you. We just need to find\nart supplies before we get to the\ngallery that we found that has a painting from\nan artist on our list. I said  we haven't\nbeen able to confirm what's on display at the gallery  but they keep saying that\nthey have things like that  and that they have had stuff from\nthe artists we need in the past  so. Just keep your eyes peeled. Do you guys sell any crayons\nor colored pencils or markers? No markers  no. No  okay. Thank you. Okay  let's try here. Giant highlighters. Oh  beautiful. Yep. There's no one here. Hello? There's no one here. Okay  we gotta go.\nOkay  okay. Wait  wait. Nail polish. That's basically  that's paint. That counts.\nThat is paint. Nail polish counts. Let's get three\ndifferent nail polishes. Okay  here's a red. This is... Get a black and white. The canvas can be\nanything though. The canvas can be anything. Canvas can be whatever we want. And the canvas can\nbe a newspaper. Buy a newspaper? Oh wait. Oh  never mind. Alright. Thank you. Ground transportation\nis this way  buddy. This way?\nYeah. Where's Uber pickup? Shuttle buses  limousine. Awesome. Oh my god. You all right  buddy?\nOh  I'm soaked. Okay. Well  we just gotta find the place. So we're looking for the\nMartin Lawrence... Gallery.\nGallery. Very big map. Martin Lawrence Galleries is\nby the Cheesecake Factory. So this way. This way. This way  then left. This is absolutely nuts. Martin Lawrence Galleries. Who's this by? I'm almost certain—\nThis is Andy Warhol  right here. Mao  1972. Okay we—\nAlright  Andy Warhol is on the list. How are you?\nGood  how are you? Good. Is it okay if we draw\na picture of one of these? Draw it in a little sketchbook. Great  incredible. Okay  this is our canvas. This piece of paper here \nwe have to cover 75% of it. \"Belle is wondering\nwhat her gift is. Draw what gift you\nwould like to get.\" I would like to get the\nstate of Nevada... by drawing Mao. Yeah  we gotta leave\nthe lips open  so... you know  give us\nsome space there. Yeah. You want to draw some? Yeah  yeah  here. I gotta say  this is\nreally coming together. He's got a very pretty eye. You've given him a very pretty eye. I feel like I'm nailing this. I mean  I just wanna say\nthis is better than I thought we were gonna do. I mean  this is really bad. But I thought we\nwere gonna do worse. Yeah  get him some more hair.\nReally fill it in. You've made Mao\nlook balder than he was. Alright  15 seconds \nfinishing touches. We're gonna get these\nlittle black dots on the side. They're very sort of faint lines. Because this is a forgery \nyou know  it's gotta be a... It has to be really precise. Yeah  it's gotta be unmistakable. Right. It's 6:41. That's time. I mean  look  I will be honest. That's better than I thought. A lot better than I\nthought we would do. I'm extremely pleased. We got a video. Okay  we playing it?\nYeah. Okay.\nGet in a good spot. Okay.\nSee where the... Are you recording?\nHang on. Hello  gentlemen. We come to you from the\nwonderful state of Nevada. (bleep)\nNevada. Sin— Wait  no.\nI can't say Sin City. Oh  that is so bad.\nIt's pretty clear that we're in Vegas. The silver state.\nThe silver state. I think it's the silver state. If we get  we can\nchallenge it tomorrow. That's a really good point.\nThat would be great. If we do successfully challenge it \nthen we'll have wasted their time. Mhm. The new card is... Go ahead. Ooh.\nSunken town. Skip a stone under a sunken town. Over a sunken town. Here's the thing  here's an\ninteresting thing about America  is we have this weird tendency\nto keep flooding towns and turning them into lakes  of which there are many\nacross this great nation. We should just situate ourselves\nin a place that would be convenient to be tomorrow. Let's just go to where\nan Uber could pick us up. So yeah  we do the soup challenge\nin Arizona in the helicopter. Yeah. And then... Come back and challenge.\nCome back  challenge. That's a good plan. That's not— I really want to claim a state\nback through a battle challenge. That would be fun.\nThat would be fun. And we'll be coming\nback to Nevada anyway  so it'll be no extra time for us. And if we get those two— And they would get\nsuper frustrated. So that's assuming that they don't\nmanage to battle challenge first. Okay  well it is almost 7 pm. We have the great state\nof Nevada now. And we've just come\nup with a plan... that we think guarantees\nthat we will win. If we execute on the plan that\nwe have just formed for tomorrow  there is no way\nwe could possibly lose. I was thinking like\nspill some soup onto my shirt  and then suck off my shirt. Because that would count.\nIt says any amount of— You're such a (bleep)\nfilthy leprechaun. Well  it would work. \"Get the soup on my\n(bleep) jacket!\" Do you have a better idea? We could do syringe—\nAnyway  it's 7 pm. So we'll see you in 10 hours. Syringe in the pocket? I don't think they'll\nlet you on with a syringe. We'll see you in 10 hours at\nthe exit of security  right? Sure. Bye.\nBye! Alright  it is 5 am. Good morning  Adam.\nGood morning  Ben. I am about to call an\nUber right now to... America's treasure... the Grand Canyon. I think we have a\nbusy morning out of us. Yeah  I'm actually\nreally looking forward to it. Yeah. Get to go to Grand Canyon.\nI've never been to it. You can't spoil it! It's five  let's go!\nI know! And an Uber to bring\nus to the Grand Canyon will be here in seven minutes. So here's the dealeo. Perhaps... Sam and Brian can get\nto Arizona faster. Perhaps not. If we get Arizona  then we're\nin a very safe position. Right  because we could challenge\nCalifornia and get the area bonus. Right? I think we would get the area bonus\nwith California  I'm pretty sure. I'm almost certain.\nYeah. If they get Arizona before us \nwe have a backup plan that we think\nwill be quite effective. But hopefully it\nwon't have to come to that. Yeah. So we're going to\na 24-hour mini-mart. I went through the pictures on Google \non the Google Maps listing  and I found  in one of\nthose photos  soup. Yes. So at least the photo is four\nyears old  so I hope that they're— That's such a\nhilarious thing to do. I hope their inventory\nhasn't changed  but at least four years ago \nthis place stocked soup  so I really hope they do now. Good morning. How are you?\nI'm fine. Looks like we're gonna\nbe in here for a while. You ever driven anyone to\nthe Grand Canyon before? Nope  first time.\n(laughs) Alright. Soup. Classic tomato.\nSipping soup. We will use new containers.\nThey very specifically say no drinking on the aircraft. So I think we—\nPeople say a lot of— It's a very small aircraft  so. They're not gonna  it's not— But they could notice\nand be like  \"What the (bleep) are you doing?\"\nSomething super— I've snuck bigger things\ninto more strict places. If they have like a\nflexible pouch  like a Ribe— You don't have Ribena\nin this country. But you know  like a Capri Sun\nwith the little twisty things. You can pour the soup in that\nand put in your gooch. But Brian... But there's gonna be\nother people sitting right next to us\non the thing. Who cares? I don't want to get\nleft at the Grand Canyon. They're not gonna leave\nus at the Grand Canyon. I don't know  is it— \"Stop  evil.\" Real quick  'cause we\ntechnically didn't do this. We're using a power-up to\nunlock the border between Nevada and Arizona  which we're about to\ncross right now. We're going over the\nColorado River. You... you can't tell. It's pitch black outside. Gum's a normal thing\nto have in your pocket. And this has like a closeable top. That's genius. Thank you  Brian. Soup acquired. Here  show them the soup. Campbell's finest. Oh  it's tomato soup. I knew this going in \nbut then once I saw it... I realize how much\nI hate tomato soup. You just need a shooter. 5 am in Vegas. Two white boys  nerdy white boys\nfilling gum canisters with soup. There you go  Brian. It's your ticket to salvation. You're going in my gooch. I am not convinced this\nwon't spill in my gooch. Just for extra safety... it says that we can\nconsume any amount of soup. You're gonna spill\nsome on your shirt. I'm gonna spill some\non my shirt. So I can suck it off\nmy shirt mid flight... if it becomes necessary. That is demonic  Sam. Brian  I don't\nwanna lose Arizona. We're a couple of\n(bleep) soup heads here. You're literally pouring\nsoup on your shirt. This is my job  Brian. (giggling) You see that? That's so (bleep) gross! Brian  we have to! Do you wanna risk it  Brian? Do you wanna risk?\nI just think it's hilarious. The plan is  I just go like \nyou can see the little morsels. I just go like...\n(giggling) Alright Brian  if something\ngoes wrong with the helicopter  you know who to call  right? 11-time gold—\nWhat does that mean? He's won gold  Brian.\nDon't question it. \"Hello  my name is Brian.\" Minor crisis.\nWe're at the wrong place. They didn't tell us when\nwe called yesterday that it leaves from the\nBoulder City Airport. It's the same company \nbut it leaves from the Boulder City location  which is— Uber's almost here.\nIt should be a 30 minute drive. So as soon as we take off\nand we're south of Lake Mead  we need to do it in case\nthey're going for Arizona too. ...six. You guys ready to\nhead on out? Oh yeah. This is gorgeous. Getting close.\nWe're close. Look  the sun's up now.\nThe sun's up. It's beautiful out here... in that Mojave Desert. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Jet Lag season four finale\nis out right now on Nebula! Will Ben and Adam hold\nonto their victory? Will Sam and Brian—\nWait  that's me. Will Brian and me—\nWill Brian and I— Will Brian and I claw our\nway back to victory? Find out right now by watching\nthe season finale on Nebula. If you're not already a\nNebula subscriber  how do I get access to this? Well  Nebula is a creator-founded\nand creator-run streaming site  started by myself and\na bunch of my friends  and we banded together to\nbasically create the best place for the content that we make. How do we do that? We  for example \ngot rid of an algorithm  so we don't have perverse incentives\nabout just getting the most views  rather than making the\nmost impactful content. We also have like this\ndifferent economic model  where we are not ad funded \nwe are subscription funded. So again  that improves\nour incentives. So we're not just trying\nto get the most views. Again  the most impactful\nviews  not the most views. So we have all sorts of original\ncontent on there  you know  beyond just Jet Lag one\nweek early and ad free. We have originals by us. We have originals by  you know \nBrian from Real Engineering  you know  our guest this season  Joseph from RealLifeLore \nour guest from season two  and and like literally\n150 other creators. So it's this amazing streaming\nsite with stuff that you can't find anywhere else. You know  this kind of stuff that\nyou watch on YouTube  but better  because it's better funded\nand not kind of sullied by the perverse incentives of\nan ad-supported platform. And what's crazy about\nNebula is  you know  they do have a direct\nway to sign up  but they also have this bundle\ndeal with Curiosity Stream. And Curiosity Stream is this\nother streaming site that does non-fiction shows and documentaries. So they have a bundle deal\nwith them  where if you sign up for any subscription for\nCuriosity Stream at our link  curiositystream.com/jetlag  they just throw in Nebula\nsubscription for free. And their subscriptions are actually\ncheaper than Nebula subscriptions. So you pay less and get two\nstreaming sites instead of one. So it works out to like $1.25\na month or something like that. I'll put the real number on\nscreen  but like something crazily low when you pay annually. And that's two streaming sites. So like  it's literally less than\nthe cost of like a third of a latte per month for two streaming sites\nin every episode of Jet Lag early. It's a crazy deal \nand Curiosity Stream  they have tons of good stuff too. Like our documentary that we\nmade for them  it's called The Colorado Problem:\nA River in the Red  really good. It's about  you know  how the\nAmerican West is going through like a massive drought and\nis gonna implode or whatever. Very dramatic  anyways. So but the main reason\nyou want to sign up right now is because again  Jet Lag\nseason four  episode five  this finale. It's there right now.\nYou can watch it right now. You don't have to wait until next\nweek when it comes out on YouTube. So head to our link \ncuriositystream.com/jetlag to sign up today or\nclick the button on screen. And also huge thank you\nif you do because that's literally how we pay for this. Obviously very expensive show by\nall those subscribers over there. And we really are grateful to them. So head over."

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome to\nthe final episode of our race to claim\nthe most states. It's the beginning of\nday four  the final day  and there are 15 hours left\nuntil the clock strikes 11 pm Eastern \nand the game ends. Right now  Ben and Adam\nhave claimed 11 states  and Brian and I have claimed six \nbut the score is 11-8  because we're in the lead for\nthe all-important two point bonus that goes to the team that's\nclaimed the greatest area. But that score\ncould change quickly. If we managed to claim\nArizona before Ben and Adam  we could battle for Nevada\nand tie the game for the very first time\nsince day one. When you last saw Brian and I \nwe were on a helicopter from Boulder City  Nevada\nto the Grand Canyon  planning to complete the\ndrink soup in a helicopter card the moment we cross into Arizona. When we last left Ben and Adam \nthey were in a car also  as it turns out \nheaded to the Grand Canyon  where they plan to complete the\nclean up a national park card. Whichever team can complete their\nchallenge first will claim Arizona and completely change\nthe course of the game. Alright  day four.\nHow are you feeling  Adam? Oh  I'm feeling very confident. That is starting to look... pretty grand. Add it to the the sky bridge.\nI've got tickets here. Okay. It's not open till eight. Oh  okay. Yeah  but feel free\nto park over here. Hello  we are here\nin the beautiful parking lot of the\nGrand Canyon. We are at Grand Canyon West. It's like 7:0-something. It turns out that the sky bridge\ndoes not open until eight. But I'm pretty sure\nthat we're already in... the national park. We just have to be\nin the national park. So I'm assuming if we\njust go and find litter... I just need to double check\nthat we're in the national park. So we're right here. We're basically on the airport. So... the national park... So it's this darker green\nthing  is the national park. Are we not in the park? Wait  Grand Canyon West is\nlike the national park  right? No. No  it goes around the\nother side of the canyon. What? Wait  wait  wait  wait. This is like a—\nIt's carved out here. Do you see this?\nAnd it's like  it stops here. It's miles that way. Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait. Yes  sir? Is this part of\nGrand Canyon National Park  or is this a different...? This is different. This is...\nOkay. ...the Grand Canyon West \nwhich has the Skywalk. Right  but it's\nnot the national park? No. National park's over in\nWilliams  Arizona. (bleep) We need to\nget back in the car. Oh my god  we need to leave. Okay. Okay. Okay. This isn't the national park? This isn't the national park. It's very beautiful. And it is the Grand Canyon. This is the Grand Canyon. That is right over there \nthe Grand Canyon's right over there. But it turns out there is\nactually nothing we can do here. (sobbing laughter) This is so bad! Let's go wait by the car. We need to get\nto the airport now. Where's Ray? Ray's in the bathroom \nbut he's coming. He's coming back out. We're sorry. We really wanted to show\nyou the Grand Canyon. We'll show a lot of\nstock footage of the Grand Canyon. Well  you can take a nap. ^0We did it  Brian. This is like the prettiest\nshot of the season. Okay. This is really bad. I don't have a follow-up.\nNo. This is really bad.\nIt's really bad. But we have a plan B. It's time for plan B. I don't know if we can\nstill pull off plan B. But we can try. Ray  I'm so sorry.\nWe gotta go to the airport. Okay  alright  we're\non our way back right now. We've just gotten a\nvideo from Sam and Brian. Oh my god  are\nthey in a helicopter? They are. Well  it turns\nout it didn't matter. They got Arizona before us. Although I think we\nwould've beaten them to it by like... By like a few minutes.\nFifteen minutes. Oh. ^0Adam texted back. I inferred it as a disappointed\n\"I see\" in response. I feel like they were\non their way to Arizona. It would make sense. Brian  give us words. Suck it  Ben. They would've beaten the— They would've been\nin the helicopter when we beat them to Arizona. That would've been pretty—\nThat would've been so funny. To Ben and Adam. ^0Cheers. Well done. Goodness. Whoa! Did you get that?\nYeah  I did. Hey  look. It's Sam and Brian  maybe. That was (bleep) cool. That was incredible.\nThat was amazing. ^0But we have to focus \n'cause we have 11 hours left  and we are back in this game. If we win this now \nif we get Nevada back  we'll draw 'em.\nYeah. We have been six states down. ^0I thought we had no shot \nbut we have proven we very much do \nwe're back in this game. The bald eagle was our saviour. ^0So we got a battle\nchallenge now  right? Yep.\nSo should we notify them? Yes.\nYou wanna call Adam? Just try and keep\nkeep your head down. There you go  you look—\nWhat? Oh geez  that's\nvery close. Hello. What do you want? ^0I think you know what we want. We want to battle. ^0Battle challenge \n30 minutes start  countdown starts now. Understood. Farewell. ^0He's really not showing\nus his background. He's trying to keep\nhis background covert. Alright  let's get into downtown. That is really\ngood timing  okay. We're gonna be at the\nairport in 12 minutes. We'll have 18 minutes\nto get settled to get ready for\nthe battle challenge. Probably get through security. Maybe  yep. We really need to win this. We really need to\nwin this battle. ^0Alright  Brian  we are\nallowed to pull another card now. Excited. We need some luck.\nWe need the spirit of the eagle. Ca-caw! ^0Get a hole in one in mini golf. That's hard. ^0Well  I don't know. There's mini golf anywhere. You play golf? 'Cause I don't. ^0No  I'm terrible at golf. Yeah  so then... Alright  Ray \nI've put in the tip. Here's an extra hundred. Ooh  thank you. Thank you so much! Thank you so  so much.\nYou have a great day. So we're gonna\nsprint through security. Try to get through security\nbefore the challenge starts. I love your Jet Lag. Oh! Thanks!\nWe're doing it right now. Holy (bleep) I watched it on the plane. That's amazing.\nYo don't— Okay  don't tell\nanyone we were here. Okay. I am... My heart is actually pounding. ^0Oh yeah  I'm nervous.\nThis is make or break. I am very much\ninvested in this now. Oh my goodness. Okay  well we've\nmade it through security just barely in time. The challenge is gonna\nstart in one minute. We're gonna get to a\nnon-descript wall. That way they won't know that we're here at the\nairport when they call. ^0This is like genuinely\nprobably the most nervous I've been in the game.\nYeah. Alright  that was weird. Hello? ^0So close  Adam \nwhat's behind you? They're at an airport.\nI can hear it. Oh yes  like an airport.\nOh  that's interesting. Anyway  let's draw a card.\nHow about that  Adam? Where's Ben? Hi. Hi. ^0Draw George Washington. Draw George Washington. Each team must select one\nplayer to draw a portrait of George Washington. That player has 30 minutes\nto gather materials and create the portrait\nin any way possible. At the end of the 30 minutes \nthe portraits will be judged by an anonymous poll posted\non Sam's Twitter account. This is very much 50-50. ^0Yeah  they actually are\nin a decent spot for that. Right  you ready for this? It's time  let's go.\nBye-bye. Okay  let's search\nfor arts and crafts. ^0The hardware store? I'm sure we can get\nmarkers and stuff there. They figured out we\nwere at the airport  okay. Very quickly they did. Okay  we gotta draw a\nportrait of George Washington. We still have the\nart supplies  don't we? No. You threw them away? I threw some of them away. I've still got this pad. And do you have\nthe markers then? No. You threw them away?\nYeah. Well  I wish you\nhadn't done that. Are you good at drawing?\nYeah. ^0Okay  good  I'm not. Are you better at drawing\nor am I better at drawing? I don't know  are you\nany good at drawing? No  I'm bad at drawing. I feel like I'm maybe\nslightly better. But I'm pretty bad. You did a very\ngood job with the Mao. I was impressed with your details. I think I want you to draw\nthis George Washington. It's right here. Oh  awesome  thank you.\nThank you. Did we just luck out? Oh  god. ^0Okay  quickly.\nWhat do we want? Oh yeah  that's perfect. Crayons?\nCrayons  yeah. ^0This is pretty good \nthis poster board. Okay  let's go. I stole this. Okay  so... Art projects for kids. How to draw\nGeorge Washington. It has a whole—\nIt has a guide. That seems like a\npretty good first line. Okay. How do we ponder\nto your audience? ^0Here. I don't know \nI don't know. Planes? ^0Yeah  put some planes in. I think we draw him\nin a pose like this. Yeah.\nAnd... Look at all these bricks. ^0Oh  that's a good idea.\nYeah  yeah  yeah  bricks. Bricks are gonna do it. Oh god. Oh god. Just wanna rough\nout the shape first. ^0Brian  I think we can get this. Me too. This feels like\nit's going pretty well. I'm loving what I'm seeing. I just feel like\nmy big concern is that it lacks pizzazz. So I'm thinking\nonce we get the line drawing\nknocked out  you know? But then we're gonna\ngo around the— We'll look around the airport for\nanything that would add some pizazz. Okay  this is the\nimportant part. The nose and the eyes. This is gonna\nmake or break us. The big hunking stack of bricks. ^0Oh  there's some good bricks. Do you know if either\nof them are decent drawers? ^0Not really. Okay  now that I'm\nseeing more of the face  it doesn't actually look\nanything like George Washington. Nope. ^0Oh  that's pretty good.\nThat's some good— That's like recognizably\nGeorge Washington. Nice job  Brian. It looks like... No  I'm not gonna say that. I think it looks great  Adam. I think it's just\nhis face is too long. So I think if I... No  now his neck looks insane. No  that was a bad idea. I'm gonna just pretend—\nI mean  he's wearing— Let's just say he's\nwearing a turtleneck  right? Very fashion forward. ...Yeah. ^0What if he just\nlike says bricks? Yeah  no  we're gonna\nmake him say something bricky. ^0What was your\nsuggestion  Brian? \"If the freedom of\nbricks is taken away  then dumb and silent\nwe may be led.\" I think that's perfect.\nOkay. ^0Ah  that's excellent. Oh yeah. I think that this is\ngonna be what we go with. And then we just need\nsome pizzazz. So I say we run a—\nLet's just try to find anything that would add pizzazz. I mean  we just need\nsome pizzazz. There's— What if we like\nmade this wig out of gummy worms or something? Ooh. You know  the audience\nmight like creativity. You know \nthat's what I'm saying. We just need like some... Yeah  gummy worm hair.\n...pizzazz. I feel like this\ncould just give it the extra pizzazz that it needs. ^0Alright  should we get some\nbackgrounds with some paint? This is excellent stuff. I'm sure that this is the best\nwe could have possibly done. Yeah. ^0That's the 10 am bell.\nWe have three minutes. We want those\nclouds to sit down. Do what we say\nto the clouds now. We say  sit down cloud \nsit down. ^0I don't know what\nyou're talking about. What a fun postmo—\nyou know  postmodern— Yeah  what does\nthis say about society? What does this say about society? I actually think\nthis is kind of working. It... yeah  it looks... ...fun. I think it's like \n\"Oh  you know  like  now they're saying something.\" Yeah  we're saying... What if George Washington\nhad gummy worm hair? Yeah. And it's sort of like... That's a pretty big question. You know? For society. This is the blood of the fallen. It represents the\nblood of the fallen. Extreme painting! ^0This is great stuff. They can't possibly have done\nbetter than that in an airport. Nice job  Brian. I'm (bleep) Picasso. It's just the boys hanging. 10:04. Send it. I really am excited to see\nwhat they think about our... interpretation of this\nnation's first president. ^0Alright  they sent\ntheir photo  Brian. Do I...?\nPull it up on your phone. (giggling) They used \n(bleep) gummy worms. ^0They gummy\nworms for their hair. That's kind of genius. ^0Technically that's allowed. Ours is definitely\nlike  oh  I don't know. Like that's kind of funny.\nYours is pretty good. I mean  for the time they\nhad  that's pretty good. Wow  okay. Very different interpretation. I think it's frankly\na complete toss up. It's a total tougher. I think it could go either way  and that's making me\nvery nervous. As the votes start to\npour in  I'm gonna be— Well  the thing is  we're not\ngonna be able to look at the votes  'cause the only way to look\nat the votes is by voting. You ready?\nYeah. ^0Come on  audience. Come on. Do it for us.\nI believe in you. ^0You're gonna win this for us. It's out there. (whispering)\nOh my god  I'm so nervous. ^0I am so nervous. Oh god  I'm so nervous. My heart is pounding. My heart is actually pumping\nover this stupid challenge. Please  please  please \nplease  please  please. Come on  come on. Oh my gosh. I can't believe it— It said one\nminute left for like— Oh  poll ending  poll ending. ^0Oh  I don't wanna... Yes! (soft wail) (devolves into grumble) I just yelled in the—\nThat was so loud. I yelled so loud\nin the airport. That was so loud\nin the airport. I yelled really\nloud in the airport. Yeah  we've lost it. ^0Yeah. (groaning sigh) All the arts and the\ncrafts in the world couldn't have beaten \n(bleep) gummy worm. ^0It's a stroke of genius. Those (bleep)\ndamn comedic writers. George Wormington has taken— George Wormington\nhas taken the win. And that means\nthat we keep Nevada. It's locked. It cannot be messed with. And... (exhausted grunt) That puts us in a\npretty good position. Great call on the gummy worms. Great call on the gummy worms. ^0So... We just tallied up\nall of the area. ^0If they get Alaska  it's theirs. The game is theirs by far. And what's really worrying me is that they have a good itinerary. If they... If they grab the flight\nto Seattle that leaves in 40 minutes \nlet me just confirm. Yeah  this flight to Seattle \nAlaska Airlines flight to Seattle. There's plenty of connections\nto Ketchikan  for example. Ohh. To everyone who voted\nfor George Wormington. I love you. Thank you so much for\nvoting for George Wormington. To everyone who did not... You tried—\nYou're dead to us. You tried to take us down \nbut we're stronger than that. Now... we're off to seal the game. Where are we going? I can't wait for you to find out. ^0If that's truly\nwhat they're doing  if they're truly going for Alaska  we need to do the best\njob possible to be sure that they cannot complete\ntheir challenge in Alaska. So what will do that... is stealing the right\ncards away from them and giving them cards that\nthey simply cannot do there. I mean  there's only one thing\nthat could mess up our plan  and it's if we missed\nour connection. Right  because we're\nflying somewhere  and then we are flying\nsomewhere from there. And if we do not make\nit to that last place... We won't win.\nYeah. ^0Right  we have a plan.\nWhat's the plan  Brian? Fly to Denver. ^0Fly to Denver  'cause\nthere's three states that we can easily get to.\nHop over the border  yeah. ^0We'd have to use\npower-ups to cross  but we have some challenges\nthat we think we could use. The smallest town in\nWyoming is right on the border. ^0Super easy to get to.\nThat gets us a power-up. There's also the mini golf one. Yeah  there's like four\nmini golf places in Fort... What's it called  Fort Collins?\nFort Collins  yeah. That's near the border as well \nso we can start driving there. Yeah.\nWe need three to win  which I think is\nfeasible to do today. ^0Yeah. Two to tie. And we need enough to\ndisrupt them with cards they can't do in Alaska.\nYeah. So they could get to Alaska as\nsoon as like 2 pm our time. Which makes me think we\nshould get the tracker. I don't  I just\ndisagree with the tracker. I think we have enough\ninformation to assume they're going to Alaska. I feel like power-ups\nare gonna be... Okay  let's think about this. We need to disrupt their\nhand as much as possible. We have four  and they can\nswap them back again. They could have a power-up. Yeah.\nWe need one to cross the border. ^0Yeah. We need another one\nto cross the border again. ^0Yeah. We don't have enough for... I don't think  to do the tracker. ^0I feel like the tracker\ninfo is so crucial  because we can figure out\nwhere they are in Alaska. 'Cause for example \nit's gonna be very different— If they're in Ketchikan  then forge\nAmerican art would be really hard. Yeah. ^0But if they're in Anchorage \nthat could be really easy  'cause there are some\nbig museums in Anchorage. Right.\nSo contextually  it's important. You've convinced me. ^0Nine hours left in the game. The tracker's good for seven hours  so I feel like we should\nactivate it basically now. Alright. Agreed?\nI'm so invested in this. Agreed?\nYeah. Alright. Well  they're buying\nthe tracker on us. They've bought the tracker. Right at the right time.\nI guess they're just gonna... see what we're gonna do. Not sure if there's\nanything they can do. Nope. Nope. This is just gonna\nbe painful for them. ^0They're still here. They must be delayed. ^0No  no  they're here \nthey're in the airport. They could be on the\nAlaska flight leaving 11:10. Yeah  but that's\ngood news  because that means they\nwaited until later. I don't know why  'cause it\nwas a 7 am flight to Seattle. I don't know why they\nspent all morning here. We're waiting in line for Chili's. ♪ Chili's ♪ ^0They have no idea where we are.\nThey have no idea where we're going. They probably don't think that\nwe have this good of a plan. So they probably think that \noh  let's just fly to Alaska. We don't  you know \neasy rest of the day. And GG  game over.\nYeah. ^0They don't know that\nwe have a great plan  and we have a real\nshot at victory. Yeah. ^0But yeah  let's go to Colorado. On the Sam Denby. That's me. Oh  I thought\nyour name was Wendy. No.\nYour name's Sam? ^0Yeah. Hello and\nwelcome to our layover  on our way to\nnot only win  but... crush Sam into a\nsmall  fine powder. Howdy  partner. ^0We've gotta rush  come on. Welcome to Colorado  Brian. To the other side of the air— Which one are you gonna pick? ^0Vroom  boy. Okay  so... It is exactly 5 pm  which means we have\nexactly four hours left. There's a lot we gotta do  but this is why we have a plan. Here's the plan: We need three points\nto win the game  and we have five steps\nto get there. Step one  drive an hour\nto Fort Collins  Colorado and claim the state and\na power-up by making a hole in one at mini golf. Step two  use that power-up to\nunlock the border with Wyoming  where we'll drive\nanother hour to Buford  the smallest town in the state  to advertise Jet Lag: The Game  claiming Wyoming and\nanother power-up. Step three  use that power-up to\nunlock the border with Nebraska  drive an hour there  and use whatever\ncards we have left to claim it. Step four  hope Ben and Adam\nare in fact going to Alaska. Step five  when they\nhopefully arrive  use the swap power-up\nto steal any cards they could do\nwherever they landed  thus preventing them from claiming\nthe state or the area bonus  and stranding them too far from the\ncontiguous US to do a backup plan. If all this works \nit would put our score at 12  their score at 11 \nthus winning the game. There are four hours\nof game time left  and that plan involves\nthree hours of driving alone  so there's absolutely\nno room for error  and none of it even matters\nif Ben and Adam went to a state other than Alaska. So we're at our gate now. They can see we're at our gate. I'm really hoping that\nthat means that right now  there's footage of Sam that\nwe can cut to of him saying  \"Oh my god \nthey're going to Alaska.\" I hope Sam is losing it. Sam never loses his cool. It's honestly\nvery frustrating. Which is honestly\nvery frustrating  'cause it would be\nreally funny if he did. Yeah. But maybe this time he did. Maybe. Because we're\nabout to screw him. ^0I did some digging with\nsome webcams in Ketchikan. I did not see a morsel of snow. Now it does snow at this time of\nyear there  so I could be wrong  but at least on the\nwebcam  I couldn't see any. We do know that they have\nspell help on an island  which would be super easy. They'll literally land on an island. Like Ketchikan Airport\nis on an island. I mean  we've filmed\nthere actually for a Nebula-exclusive documentary. Alaska's Silent Summer.\nUse the code REALENGINEERING. ^0No  no  no.\nJETLAG  JETLAG. REALENGINEERING.\nOr whatever. I actually really\nneed it at the moment. Our conversions are down. I'm not getting paid for this. ^0Yes  you literally are.\nStop lying to the audience. We made a whole\ndocumentary about Ketchikan. We're gonna go see Paula. It was a very sad\ndocumentary  so hopefully it's not\nso sad there right now. Yeah. ^0Honestly  the difference\nbetween like five minutes at mini golf\nand 15 minutes at mini golf could absolutely decide the season. 100 percent. ^0♪ I'm so stressed \nI'm so stressed ♪ Look  GlowGolf! Okay  park. ^0Oh  I should park  Brian?\nYou think I should park? It's an easy one\nwith this green one here. ^0Nope. (chuckles)\nBrian! Jesus Christ! Nope. Ooh... ooh!

(bleep)\nI can't (bleep) believe it. Let's go. (bleep) ^0Alright. I can't believe it. That was looking so bleak. Alright  I'm putting the\ndirections in for Buford  Montana. One hour  nine minutes.

I don't know if there's\nany casinos. Let's check.\nOkay. So Ben and Adam are about\nsix minutes away from landing. This is crunch time. Welcome to Alaska  buddy. Yay. Alright  so they landed. ^0And they're about to\nreceive some unfortunate news approximately now. I hope it's not... I hope they're getting\nunfortunate news. I hope we've ruined their day. ^0The cut already happened. Okay.\nBecause that's why— We got an extremely ominous\nmessage from Sam and Brian. They sent us a video.\nThey said  \"Wait til you get off the\nplane to react to the video and watch it all the way through.\" It's either a really good\nthing or a really bad thing. Okay.\nOkay. Time to watch... this. I'm so nervous. Okay. Video from Sam and Brian. Okay. Hello lads.\nHello! I hope your flight\nto Alaska was gorgeous. ^0I think we have\nsome news for you. We have some news.\nSome news. A welcome gift to Alaska. Colorado is ours. Colorado.\nAlso... Also? ^0Also we are using one power-up\nto steal two of your cards. We're also gifting you two cards \n'cause you know we're nice and that's the power-up. We're gifting you mail this\ncard and visit the Grand Canyon. I hope you can make it\nthe Grand Canyon in time. Anyways  we're busy \nwe got stuff to do. Hope you enjoy your\ntime in Ketchikan... And enjoy the evening. Suck it.\nYeah. Okay  well  they've\nused a swap on us. They've used a swap. We are simply\ngoing to swap back. We anticipated\nthat they might do this. We just have to hope that\nthey cannot swap us again. They were in a car \nso my hope is that they used\nanother power-up... Right.\nto cross a border. Okay. Okay. Okay  we are so close\nto the border  so we're just going for it. We're playing a risky bet. ^0Yep. Alright  here we are. It's the blue one? Yep.\nThat's the sign right there. There's Wyoming  and that's\nour power-up gone. Power-up gone. ^0We have zero power-ups\nright now  but in... Welcome to Wyoming. In  let's see  29 minutes \nwe'll get another power-up. Okay  okay. We will send them our hand. So they have:\ngo sky diving  win top-tier prize \nshoot a bullseye  spell help  skip a stone\nover a sunken town  clean up a national park \nbuild a snowman. Build a snowman  and help. Okay  I'm nervous. How do we get outta this place? So just to be clear \nKetchikan is on an island. They're on actually\na different island. This is Gravina Island \nand so we can spell— Okay  gravel right here. Oh my god  it's rock central. And a perfect place to spell help. Okay  so. This place rocks. Haha. Nailed it.\nGet it? ^0We're sure the\nsnowman's one's worth it? There's no other ones there. ^0You sure? Shoot a bullseye potentially. ^0Shoot a bullseye  but\nit's with bow and arrow  right? Yeah.\nNo  no  just... (bleep) We have to do it  Sam.\nOkay  fine  send it. Oh  that's them. Snowman and spell help.\nWe suspected that. So inform them that\nwe are swapping back. Okay  I'm gonna call them. They're probably responding.\nHello? Hello gentlemen. We would like to\nswap cards with you. ^0Alright. Alright  we would like spell help\nand the s'mores one please. Got it.\nOkay. Okay  bye. Bye.\nBye. They didn't swap back.\nThey didn't swap back  okay. Time to spell help\nbefore they do. (bleep bleep bleep)\nOh  damn. Our one chance.\nWe got 20 minutes. ^0We have 21 minutes.\nThey can do it by then. (bleep) damn it. Oh no. Well  no  but like if we \nif we manage to get there  get the power-up and steal—\nThey have 21 minutes. Put the (bleep) down.\nThey're on an island right now. I mean  we gotta try. We gotta try.\nAw man. I don't think it's gonna take\nthem 20 minutes to do it. ^0Aw man. Each letter\nmust be one foot tall. Oh  it's rock time. Oh (bleep) Oh  my hands are so cold.\nThese rocks are so cold. Okay  that's an H. (silly growl)\n(bleep) It was a valiant (bleep) effort. So close. ^0Oh my god! Is there anything\nwe could do right now? ^0There's nothing we can do. Oh  we should have stopped\nbefore the Wyoming border. Good? Yeah. This is triumphant music\nplaying in the background. Literally (bleep) minutes in it. Minutes in it. They're on an island.\nThey're on the (bleep) (growl) Wait  one more rock. Okay. We have spelled help on an island. Gravina Island in Alaska  that\nmeans we have claimed Alaska. Let's call Sam and Brian.\nAnd that's the game  baby! Let's call 'em. Oh  woo! Way to go  buddy.\nWe did it. We did it. The score is now \nI believe 14 to eight. Eight. Is that correct? Hello?\nWait  wait  wait. Hello  gentlemen.\nWait  wait  wait. We're filming.\nBrian doesn't know how to film. Okay  go ahead.\nOkay. Hello. Hi. Gentlemen... we come to you... from America's largest... and some might say its most\nbeautiful state  Alaska  and we have claimed it. Show us the sign. Help. Help!\nHelp! This is what you're\ngonna need to win the game. Any thoughts?\nAny parting words  gentlemen? ^0This is great.\nWe wanted this to happen. I'm totally fine with this. We still have two hours.\nOf course. Totally have path to\nvictory  whatever  bye. Bye-bye.\nOkay... Peace out.\nGood bye  lads. Bye-bye.\nGood luck. Yay! It's gonna get dark\nin like 30 minutes. So we really are going to \nwe really want do like a... This is the majestic\nsplendor of Alaska. Look at this  look at\nhow beautiful it is! It's very beautiful.\nLook all around! Isn't it incredible? And this is what it\nlooks like in late October. Ah  it's so beautiful here. Look at this. Now we just have to figure\nout how to get over there. Yeah  we gotta figure\nout how to get over there. Okay.\nKids. ^0That one fricking power-up. That did it. It wasn't for that one\nfricking power-up they had  if they had just decided\nto swap cards once or had a tracker or something. Damn. Anyway  it's been real  Brian. It's been nice having you back. Do you think we should have\nspent the tracker on the... ^0There it is. That gas station  that's Buford. We're here in the\nsmallest town in Wyoming. Okay  let's call 'em  Brian. I want them to see this. Okay. Okay.\nAlright. ^0They're back  Brian. Okay  they've\njust called us again. ^0Alright  guys. We come to you from\nBuford  Wyoming. I don't know if you know  but Buford is the smallest\ntown in Wyoming. Population \nwhat was it  like one? One person. Oh my goodness. Are you advertising for\nJet Lag: The Game there? Wait  it's the smallest\ntown in Wyoming? ^0We are leaving an\nineffective advertisement for Jet Lag: The Game. It's absolutely... Baltic out. ^0So the sign says  in\ncase you're wondering  it says: https://youtube.com/jetlagthegame. Quote  \"It's good\" by Wendy \nand then it was given  uh uh. What is that?\nIt's a minus. Four stars minus one \nso I guess that equals three. Oh  that makes a lot of sense.\nThat makes sense. Yeah  people are gonna love\nhow much sense that makes. ^0Okay  so I don't know if you\nrealize that means that we have claimed the great state of Wyoming. Congratulations. (indistinct) Well done. ^0However... We also concede that\nat this point in the day  we have no viable path to victory  with y'all having claimed\nthe area bonus from Alaska. Therefore...\nI'll let this truck pass. Therefore  I really hate to say it  but Brian and I would like to\ncongratulate y'all for having won season four of Jet Lag: The Game. Yay!\nYay! Let's go baby! Let's go  let's go.\nWoo-hohohoo! ^0We do have something for you. I've been carrying this thing\naround the entire time in my rucksack \nand my back is broken. ^0Yeah. Alright. (chuckling) Yeah. That general direction. Launch it  Sam. Oh my god  it's a big one. ^0Yeah  this is the biggest\none we've had yet. Why're you crouching? Oh  oh  it's crushing me. Oh  that is—\nPush it in! Thank you! Yes!\nYes! Got it?\nWow. We got it! Oh  that's amazing. That's the best  most amazing\ntrophy in the whole world. And we spent—\nHey  Brian. Hey  Brian. Would you like— I'm feeling very tired\nhere at the end. Would you like to say the honors? Say what honours? You gotta say the line  Brian. Say the line  Brian.\nSay the line  Brian. What's the line? ^0Are you feeling tired? Very tired. ^0What would a word be? Oh  oh.\nYou know what I'm saying  Brian! I guess I have jet lag. ^0Oh  he said the word!\nHe said the word! Let's go!\nYeah! He said the word.\nHe said the word. I genuinely didn't know\nwhat was going on. See you next season folks! We'll see you wherever\nthat happens to be very soon. Woo! Bye! Bye! ^0Bye! Bye! See you next season  bye! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Well  I just finished filming\nthe season four aftershow.

We also answered\nall sorts of questions. So if you ever ask this season  \"Why did Sam do this?\"\nor \"Why did Ben do this?\" or like stuff like that \nwe answered it probably on there.

        "transcript": "We're playing\n\"Tag Across Europe\". We're in Charleville  France \nbut that bell means it's 6 AM  and Ben's the runner \nso he's gotta go  go  go! Go-go-go  Ben!\nBye! Go Ben. Go Ben. Go Team Ben. Bye  Ben. Bye  Ben! Okay  we're here in Charleville. Of course \nbecause no tagbacks  right? So we've gotta stay stationary  or basically stationary \nfor 45 minutes. So we've actually got\na good amount of time to plan and strategize and\nexplain what this is all about  while Ben goes off to... I guess Germany probably  or Netherlands or Belgium\nor something. We're in Charleville-Mézières  France  because it's the approximate midpoint\nbetween our three finish-line locations. In this game  Ben's trying to get\nhere to Borkum  Germany  Adam's trying to get here\nto Jersey  UK  and I  Sam  am trying to get here\nto Zermatt  Switzerland. While you're the Runner \nyou can move towards your location. If you successfully reach your location \nyou win immediately. Otherwise  the win\ngoes to whoever's location is closest to the Runner\nat the end of three days  which you can tell\nlooking at these win areas. But while you're running \nthe other two are \"It\"  aka \"Chasers\". They'll have a live tracker\non the Runner  and will work together\nto tag them. After a tag  positions rotate. The Runner becomes a Chaser \nand the next Chaser becomes the Runner. All of which is why Ben needs to\nget out of Charleville-Mézières as soon as possible! Okay  step one: I gotta get out of Charleville. On my way to the train station \nI was looking at all the trains. And we're in a pretty small town.\nCharleville's pretty small. So there aren't that many trains\nleaving around now at 6 AM. But there is a train to Lille... ...that leaves in about\n20 minutes. It's in the right direction. And the key is  it doesn't seem like there's\nanother train to Lille for a while. Which means that I'll be\npretty safe there... ...hopefully... for a little while. I think he's gonna get on\nthe 6:25... to Lille. We can't get to Lille for a long time.\nMhm. If he does that... Do we go straight to Brussels? I kinda think we go\nstraight to Brussels. What—?\n(bells chiming) That classic bell to indicate\nthat it's 6:14 AM. Okay. Okay. I've made it to the train station. The train is here. (softly) So lemme grab a seat. Okay  he's definitely on\nthe track to Lille. It's just like a really slow train  which is really unfortunate\nfor Ben  because... ...you have to pay for transit\nby the minute  not by distance. Quick explanation time:\nwhen you're the Runner  if you want to take any form of\ntransportation other than walking  you have to purchase it\nfrom The Shop using coins. One minute of low-speed rail\nis 10 coins  one minute of high-speed rail\nis 25 coins  and so on. We each start with 2000 coins \nbut to earn more coins  the Runner must complete\na randomly-drawn card from the challenge deck. If they complete the challenge \nthey'll earn the reward. But if they fail to complete it \nor choose to veto it  they can only walk or run\nfor the next 30 minutes. Okay  so I've just boarded\nmy train to Lille. I spent 1500 coins on\n150 minutes of low-speed rail. And I started with 2000 coins \nso by the time I get to Lille  as you may have realized \nI'm gonna be close to out of coins. He'll have to spend 1500 coins\njust to get to Lille. Which means that if he then\nwants to get to Brussels  that's 34 minutes\non high-speed rail  but he'd have to do\na challenge... in Lille. Oh  so we need\nto be optimizing for... Well  here's the thing.\nWe still can't get there very fast. But I wonder if we take\nthis bus to Hirson  can we then get to Lille...? So  there is a train that\nwe could get to in Hirson  that goes direct to Lille after. Uh-huh  that's interesting. That's interesting  but that's a risk. It gets in at 9:55.\nHe'll get into Lille at 8:55. So that's— I don't know—\nHe'd have an hour. An hour is enough to do\na challenge and get out of there. Okay  it's just about to be 6:45  and even though I'm on a train \nand I'm totally safe... ...I  like... ...my heart is racing! Our 45-minute prison time\nends in like 25 seconds. Ben is definitely going to Lille \nand our plan is we're gonna take a bus to Hirson \nand then a train to Lille. We're gonna get there\nan hour after him. But I think that he's gonna be\nstuck there doing a challenge  and we'll be able to\ncatch him right away. I hate when there are\npeople in our vlogs. It's so awkward!\nIt's so awkward. Alright  wait  wait. Is it...?\nIt's not time yet. Okay. We are literally gonna have to\nrun to this train. It leaves in tw— Oh  there!\nOh  here we go! (bell chiming) See  that's the bell thing!\nThere you go! That's the first time it was on time!\nThat's how you know we're legit! Okay  well...\nSam and Adam are off. They are hunting me. It's scary.\nIt's scary being hunted. I don't know if you can relate. Comment below if you've been\nhunted by men  for sport. I'm wearing my...\nDanny Ricciardo hat this season... ...to remind myself that\nit's alright if you lose constantly. As long as you have fun\nwhile you're doing it  right? Who's Danny Ricciardo? It's fine  you won't get\nthat reference. The main thing now is\nwe have to figure out... It's a bus  but it seems to be\nrun by the train company. Yeah  I don't know how that works. So we need to figure out\nwhere it leaves from. Okay  you think it's that?\nYeah. That's the only bus I see \nand it says SNCF on it. So it must be that bus.\nOkay. Hey there.\nBonjour. This bus leaves in seven minutes. I don't think there's a single soul on it.\nIt's not too busy. Yeah. I know we just started the game \nbut my legs literally already hurt. When we— So we all\nflew into Paris yesterday  and Sam was like \n\"You know what'd be fun? Let's go on a little\nscenic walk in Paris.\" And we're like \n\"Yeah  that'll be fun.\" And Sam took us— I'm gonna put up a picture\nof what these stairs look like. We walked up this.\nHe brought us up this. And I'm convinced he did this\nto sabotage us. 'Cause... he...\nlives near the mountains. He's always mountain biking\nand hiking and stuff. And so  he was fine  but I... I am not fine. Alright  where is he? It's updating. That... Is that on the...?\nThat's not on the train line. That's not on the train line.\nI mean  that must be a— That must be an anomaly.\nAn error. He couldn't have gone there that quickly.\nNo  no. I mean  that's gonna be an interesting\nthing about these trackers  is they are not perfect.\nYeah. Okay  let's do a little Q&A. Let's answer some of your questions. Mayor Video asks: \"I'm probably the only person who finds Ben and Adam\nextremely annoying.\" I'm sorry  Mayor Video.\nThat is not a question. I've always wondered\nhow they make wind. ...What? Okay! Bienvenue à Lille. Merci  au revoir. Merci. So...\nSo our train isn't til 8:07. Yeah  we have a little bit of time. Do you wanna see if we can get\na croissant or something? Un petit pain au chocolat?\n(laughing) Je quoi? I just wanna say that... I'm pretty sure that Ben\ndoesn't know that we can do this. So I really hope that there's footage\nthat we can cut to right now  of Ben saying something\nalong the lines of... I don't think there's a way\nfor them to get here. But I'm still so nervous. Okay  so here's the deal.\nI don't know where I'm going. I've been navigating\nwith just like... ...cardinal directions\nand vibes.  But looking at a map... ...it seems like the next places\nI might wanna go... ...would be Brussels or Ghent. And there's a train to Ghent\nin about an hour. There's a train to Brussels\nin like an hour and a half. But either way  I don't have... ...enough coins for\neither of those trains. So that means that\nit is time for me... ...to pull a challenge card \nand earn some more coins. So let's do that. Okay  so I've got the deck.\nIt's all shuffled. So I'm just gonna pull the top card \nand whatever it is... ...that's the challenge I gotta do. I can veto it \nand be stuck here for an extra half hour\nbefore I pull my next card. But hopefully \nI won't have to veto it. Here we go. My card is... \"Eat at the worst restaurant.\" Okay  I have to find the\nworst-reviewed restaurant within two miles of\nwhere I am right now. And go there and eat something. (chuckling) So let's go do that. Okay  so it was surprisingly\ndifficult to sort for \"worst restaurant\" on TripAdvisor\nfor some reason. But the worst-reviewed restaurant that is currently open\nwithin two miles of me is this place \nLe Club Sandwich Cafe  which warns me to\n\"be careful with the girl.\" So... I guess I will go there and\nbe careful with the girl. This is pretty luxurious  having every method of transport\nso far to ourselves. Yeah  it's kinda nuts.\nYeah. It also makes me feel a lot less\nbad about... filming. 'Cause I'm not bothering anybody.\nRight  yeah. It's great. Love it. It's gonna be a lot worse when\nthere's a bunch of people around  and then still having to film. E-yup. Fortunately  it's only about\na ten minute walk from here. So I think I'm gonna make\nreally good time on this challenge  and this is actually\nreally good  because... ...we did not have time\nto eat yet today  and I don't know when else\nI was gonna eat. So having an eating challenge  even if it is the worst restaurant \nis pretty exciting. So  I'm doing this all covertly  since Adam's gonna become\nmy competitor after we tag Ben. But of course  as we're going \nI'm looking and researching about what the best move\nis in Lille for me to do. Since I'm next as the Runner. I'm trying to— I think the catch\nis gonna happen in Lille. I'm also gonna research a little\nabout Ben in Brussels. But I always have to keep\nan eye towards the next thing  when I'm gonna become the Runner. Okay  so I lost audio during\nthis entire time that I was in Lille. So I'm just gonna walk\nyou through what happened. Basically  I went to\nLe Club Cafe. I looked at some sandwiches. I picked one of the  like \ntwo sandwiches that was available. I got that and a\nvery lukewarm mojito. I ate the sandwich.\nIt was a bad sandwich. I don't— I don't know\nwhat else to say  besides that I don't know\nwhat was in it. I don't think I can really describe it. It just had a kind of...\nan orange... goo inside of it. And it was very hot\nand very bad. But I housed the sandwich\nfast enough that I was able to make\nthe earlier route to Ghent  so that's what I decided to do  instead of waiting for\nthe train to Brussels. And yeah  that's all you\nneed to know. Just enjoy watching me\nsuffer through this. And back to the show! So if you'll show that  it looks like he's headed\nback to the station. Which could be a problem \nInteresting. 'cause we don't get there\nfor fifteen minutes. I mean  we don't get there\nfor twenty minutes. He couldn't get on the train to Brussels \nbut he could get on another train. Ben is right in front of the station. That's the station that\nwe'll be at in ten minutes. I think this is gonna be tight.\nIt looks like he's going for a train. You think so?\nYeah  the question is  is that train in\nthe next ten minutes? Can we intercept him once we get there?\nOh man. That is gonna be tight! Yip. Well  let's see. I really hope he's not\nabout to get on a train. Okay  so I'm getting on\nthis train to Courtrai.[court-rai] And then I'm transferring there\non a train to Ghent. Now I just have to figure out\nwhere this train is. Oh  he just moved\ninto the train station. Oh  yeah. So yeah. We gotta be covert\nas we get off this train. Let's see. Oh man  he's definitely\nabout to get on a train. (hisses) Yeah  but is it\nin the next nine minutes? Oh man! (wheezes) I've got my ticket. That'll cost me 360 coins  'cause it's 36 minutes on\nlow-speed rail. Hoo. I'm gonna get caught \nand it's gonna be right here. I'm just standing around\nwaiting for this train. And there are huge\ncrowds of people  so... ...it's gonna be impossible\nto see them if they're here. Five minutes away. I'm a little worried\nhe's going to a platform. Uh-oh. Kinda looks like\nhe's going to a platform. (softly) Don't go to the platform. Alright  train is here. I'm gonna get at least another stop\nwithout getting caught. Ah man  my heart is pounding. (announcer speaking in French) Alright.\nOkay. He's over there.\nHe's definitely on a platform. Okay. Wait wait  hide hide. He's on the train.\nHe's on the train. So we need to get\non that train and find him. I believe so. Okay. Alright. That's a good question.\nThere's two trains. Man  I'd be so bad\nto (bleep) that up. It's unclear.\nIt's unclear? No  there's two. Would he be\ngoing to Tournai or to Courtrai? I'm getting on\nthis train to Courtrai.[court-rai] Okay  we need to be quick \nbecause those are gonna leave soon. And if he's not on one  then we need\nto be able to check the other. Let me check where Tournai is. Okay  Tournai is in Belgium.\nOkay  okay  okay. Then let's go Tournai.\nSo blue and white  okay. No  that's on track 15.\nThat's to Courtrai. Tournai is on 11. Oh  is it? This is 13. Where's track 11?\nTrack 11's here. Okay. That's 11  that's track 11. But he's on this? They are? We need a ticket? Okay then  you have your phone.\nBook a ticket  book a ticket. You're sure it's this train? I'm pretty sure. Yep. Where are you going?\nTo Courtrai. Your ticket  please.\nThank you. Man! How did you get here so fast?! Where's Adam? He's making sure you don't\nrun off the platform. Okay  well let's get off\nthe freaking train then. We got him! How you feeling buddy? I really didn't think you guys\ncould get here. I was like— And I still was like \nI'm gonna get on the fastest freaking train\nI can get on. I was like... Awh.\nMan! Man! Alright  here.\nCome on  come over here. I just don't want that\nticket inspector asking... Yeah! (laughs) ...about why I walked on that train\nand immediately departed. (cackles) Yeah  turned out\nthere was a bus to Hirson! Yeah. Give the cards a shuffle \nso we can hand them off to Sam. I don't wanna give them up. (laughs)\nI don't— I want them to be mine. How's your budget feeling? Better or worse\nthan when you started? It would be pretty amazing\nif it was... (muttering indistinctly) That's interesting! (wheezes and cackles) Bastards. The cards.\nMerci. And it is... Oh  I'm going?\n...10:07. Which means that we can start\nchasing you at 10:52. Are you saying my time started? Your time starts now. Bye!\nBye  Sam. Alright  make sure to film yourself!\nSee you in Zermatt! Oh  Sam Denby started sharing\nhis location with me. Ooh  how exciting! I'm worried he's gonna be\ntoo good at this game. He sure does know\na whole lot about trains. It would look like Sam\nis already on a little train. Wait  what?\nHe's already on a train? Well  it looks like\nhe's on a train  doesn't it? What the hell? Where is he going? Might be going west. He's going west?\nWhy would he go west? West is the one way\nhe doesn't wanna go. The man... is going northwest. Okay  just to be clear \nnorthwest is the exact opposite of the way to Zermatt. The man should be going\nsoutheast  but he is going northwest. I just don't— I'm so confused\nabout where the (bleep) he is. Okay  that worked out perfectly. So I wanna explain\nthe move I just pulled. Basically  I think Ben messed up.\nI think Ben made a bad move. He spent a ton of budget to travel\nreally far on a low-speed train  to do one challenge and end up\nwith less budget than when he started. I think the thing to do right now is to grind through challenges \nearn budget  so that we can do a\nreally robust  high-speed — and that's the key thing \nhigh-speed — run  which costs more  to our location. Three minutes after I was looking \nturned out there was a train to Calais. Trains to Calais  they seem\nto only go every few hours. So after this  there's not another\ntrain to Calais for two hours. And there doesn't seem to be\nanother means of transportation. So I think I'm gonna have a\ntwo-hour safe window in Calais to just grind through challenges  while Ben and Adam\njust wait around. So that's perfect! We think we figured out\nwhat train he's on. It's this. He did this shape. So I think he's on this train\nto Calais-Ville. I don't know why though \n'cause that's like... ...the opposite direction. Yeah.\nCalais is like... ...all the way northern France. Maybe he just thinks that\nwe won't be able to get there. It's interesting.\nMaybe he's right. Can we get there? There's a train\nscheduled at 12:13. It's the same train.\nIt's not amazing. I mean  that gives him\na two-hour head start. Alright. We are in Calais  the closest\nFrench city to Britain. Only about 30 miles away. Right now... ...I have to commit an\nAmerican crime. I've done a bunch\nof research on the train  and there's a pretty easy one \nit turns out. In almost all of the US \nincluding Colorado  where I'm from  it is illegal to drink in public. In most of Europe  including France  it is legal to drink alcohol\nin public. Therefore  what I'm gonna do\nis drink alcohol in public. Okay  we're out of jail. We're back  we're on the hunt. I'm gonna put on my\nhunt glasses. So here's our logic. He's going to Calais. We could get to Calais\nby 1:30. And he probably knows that.\nAnd he is gonna figure that out. Which I think means he will take\na train leaving Calais before 1:30. And in terms of— If he's gonna\nhave time to do a challenge  that actually only leaves\nthree trains. One to Étaples - Le Touquet  one to Hazebrouck \nand one to Dunkirk. So... let's look at those. Okay  alcohol acquired. Alright  this is my spot. See? Public. Tower. I guess I should\nget right to it. Just to be sure  I got the\n\"Extreme - intense stong beer\". Alright. Drinking in public  completed. Well  if we want to get\nto Étaples  that's— we have to get\nthrough Calais anyway. That sucks! Hazebrouck is just back\ntowards here. Hazebrouck is on the train\nthat we would be on to get to him. So he wouldn't do that. Alright  it's starting to rain. So while I finish eating  because I now can \nsince I completed the first challenge  I'm gonna pull another card.\nSo I'm supposed to pull the top card. Uh-oh. We didn't mention this earlier \nbut this season  we have a new type of card:\nCurse Cards! And... I just pulled one. \"The name of your next\ntown  city  or municipality that you disembark in cannot be\nlonger than five letters.\" Okay. So there's a world\nwhere he goes to Dunkirk  and if he goes to Dunkirk  then we could cut him off\nin Dunkirk  potentially. 'Cause we could go straight\nto Dunkirk  I'm just saying. But  if he fakes us out... ...and we're stuck in Dunkirk \nthat would suck a lot. I mean  it's a big risk  right? Could we get from Dunkirk\n[to] somewhere else quickly? No  not really. Bit of a good news \nbad news situation. I haven't talked about this yet. But  my plan was to go\nto Dunkirk next. D-U-N-K-I-R-K. That kind of ruins that plan. \"Cannot be longer than five letters.\"\nSo it can be five letters. But Dunkirk is six. Okay  so we've decided\nto go to Dunkirk. I am pretty sure\nwe're gonna get him. Dunkirk makes a lot of sense. It makes so much sense\nfor him. I think he's gonna do\nDunkirk. Oh man  it's gonna be so sweet\nif he goes to Dunkirk! Hello  it's me again.\nI'm still eating my lunch  but I just wanna acknowledge \nDunkirk has seven letters. I just realized that. I know that. Not six. I'm smart. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Well  if you wanna see how much\nthese guys just messed up  as you probably know by now\nif you're a longtime Jet Lag viewer  you can see the next episode \nepisode two  right now... ...if you go watch on Nebula. That's of course in appreciation for\nthe fact that the Nebula subscribers are kinda the ones funding the show. But this season  it makes even more sense\nto be a Nebula subscriber  'cause we're gonna end the season\non a long after-show episode  where we answer\na lot of your questions  dive deep into some of the strategy. But there's way more reason\nto subscribe to Nebula  like for example... Like Crime Spree  our pilot season\nof Jet Lag: The Game  where we chase Sam\naround the country while he tries to break\nthe country's silliest laws. It was traumatic.\nIt was rough. This was the season before we\nfigured out we needed rest periods. Yeah  this is the reason\nwe have rest periods. But also  what's crazy about Nebula\nis the best way to sign up for it is kind of an unbelievable deal\nin and of itself. Yeah  it's this bizarre thing\nwhere you can actually get access to CuriosityStream and Nebula  for less money than it takes\nto sign up for either of them. CuriosityStream is an incredible\ndocumentary streaming service  that has among other things \nan entire Wendover series called Extremities \na series that I worked on  that is about why and how the most\nremote settlements in the world exist. If you like Jet Lag  and you like travel \nI really think you would enjoy Extremities. We're really proud of Extremities.\nWe've worked really hard on it. And we think it's really good. This series literally could not\nexist financially without all of you Nebula +\nCuriosityStream bundle subscribers. It's only $15 — actually it's slightly less\nthan $15 — for the entire year. It's a crazy good deal!\nIt's a crazy good deal. And yet  you all really do help\nfund this channel. We know exactly-- This channel could not exist financially \nit would not be profitable without you all. So it's really worth signing up \n'cause you also get all that other stuff. One week early access to episodes  exclusive behind-the-scenes \nafter-show stuff. All sorts of other stuff from us \nall sorts of stuff from other creators. It's a crazy good deal \nso click the button on-screen  or head over to curiositystream.com/jetlag\ntoday to sign up and... (sneeze) ...thanks in advance for your support!\nThanks for watching! (cackling) You almost got it.\nI think we gotta use that. Let's keep that.\nWe gotta use that take!"

        "transcript": "Right now  we're playing\n\"Tag Across Europe.\" This is episode two  so go\nwatch episode one if you wanna... ...know what happened\nin episode one. But just as a refresher \nin order to win  the Runner must reach their designated\nend location before getting caught. If no one reaches their location\nby the end of three days  then it all comes down to\nwhose location the Runner is closest to when the clock runs out. Earlier today  Adam and I\ncaught Ben in Lille  which means that I'm the runner now. I took the first train up to Calais \nwhich is away from my location  but it bought me some time\nto do some challenges and earn some budget for later. Ben and Adam  the Chasers \nare heading up to Dunkirk  hoping that they can\ncut me off there. Okay... Here we go again.\nAnother card pull. This has been really easy. Oh no...! Ugh  god dammit  okay. Similar to the last one \nit makes onward stuff harder. Now I'm gonna have to lug\neverything around tote bag style. So... ...let me go find a tote bag. We're off. We switched seats  since we raided\nwhere people weren't talking. Oh yeah  we realized—\nShow the little guy. We realized that there's\nthis little guy in each car  and he tells you whether\nyou can talk or not. Yeah  and we were in a place where\nyou seemingly weren't allowed talk at all. Yeah  the guy was saying \n\"Shut the (bleep) up.\" Uh-huh! So  the card specifically says that\nany bag that you carry with handles like a tote bag\ncounts as a tote bag. So  I think the easiest place to find one\nis gonna be the grocery store. Okay  at the supermarket. First  I'm gonna stock up\non snacks. These are amazing. If you ever see these\nat a grocery store  get these. And look at this. Perfect. Bonjour... Merci. Oh  it's raining out now.\nThat's not great. Probably two bags I'm gonna try. If you're wondering how\nI packed everything into this  I tightly packed all my clothes  and essentially vacuum-sealed them \nin all these different plastic bags. Alright  going for bag two. It's another thousand coins! Yes...! That was my celebration. Alright  yeah  I guess we should\npull another card now. The train that we don't\nwant him to take  which goes south...\nThe first one. Yeah  that leaves in nineteen minutes  and he's still not by the train station. We're hoping that he doesn't\nget on that train... ...'cause he is gonna get to Dunkirk. God  I hope he goes to Dunkirk. It'll be so funny if we just\nget him immediately there. Just as a reminder \nI'm not going to Dunkirk  because I pulled this Curse\nlast video. There was only one way\nthat we could have done it. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed. And... ...Ooh. \"Estimate your city's population.\nYou may only guess once. \"You cannot use\nyour phone  the internet  \"or ask anyone any questions\nwhile this challenge is active. If you are off by more than 25 percent \nthis card is automatically vetoed.\" I think what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna try to... look for the... ...like  the town hall \nthe Hôtel de ville of Calais. And hopefully  that'll have some sort of sign\nthat says the population or something. I don't really know if it would \nbut I'm gonna at least try that. And in the process  I'll get more\nof a vibe of the city. So  let's give that a shot. In case you're wondering\nhow unpleasant lugging these around in tote bags and filming is \nin the rain... ...the answer is much! Very conveniently  I found this map. It's  like  the city center of Calais. Not massive. So right now  I'm feeling like \nmaybe 40 thousand  35 thousand. Ben  you got any really great\nbits to do on the train? I already did all my bits \non my own. Mmmmh.\nI'm out of bits. I save my bits for the people\nwho are rooting for Team Ben. #TeamBen.\n(wheezes) Do you wanna start a hashtag? Um... I'm gonna do hashtag... #EveryonesAWinner. Nerd. Alright  made it to the big square. Usually  the central square\nof a French city is where the Hôtel de ville is \nthe town hall is. But I'm not seeing one  unless that's it.\nI'm gonna check out that building. Okay. This was not the Hôtel de ville.\nI don't know what this is. I think I'm gonna go for a guess.\nI just don't— I just can't think of other\nuseful ways to use my time. (shuddering groan) So  I'm thinking 40 000.\nI'm not gonna lock in that answer. I'm just wondering if I should go\na little bit lower. 'Cause it doesn't look like\na city that has grown a lot recently. These buildings look like they are\nfrom the '80s or something. My worry is if\na lot of these are empty. (sigh) Alright. I think I'm gonna lock it in. Yeah. I'm gonna lock it in\nat 37 500 people. That is final answer.\nTime to look it up. That sucks! Oh man  that would've been\na thousand coins! I'm so... god dammit! Wanna hear something\nthat sucks even more? So I technically vetoed that card\nby failing it  at 12:32. So my 30-minute veto period\nends at 1:02. There's a train at 1:02  that's the train\nI wanted to take  to Dunkirk. (sniffle) But I can't take it.\nBy one minute. And that's the last train\nuntil 12— or 2:29. They're gonna get in at 1:30. Basically... ...I'm a bit screwed. So I'm gonna get as far away\nas I can from the train station  to build myself enough—\nas much time as possible to do more challenges\nuntil they catch up with me. I just don't see a way of evading that catch\nwith the current train schedule. So... I'm starting to think\nhe's not going to Dunkirk. 'Cause that train leaves in 12 minutes \nand he's nowhere near the train station. He's still in Calais \nand it's also— But what's weird is that he doesn't seem\nto have another way out of Calais. Alright  I'm back at the water.\nI'm gonna walk to that fort  'cause it's basically as far as\nyou can get from the train station. Oh  this is interesting. I definitely watched\na Tom Scott video about these. Alright. I have eight minutes\nuntil my veto period ends. Therefore... ...it's that time to figure out\nhow much I've screwed up by putting Adam in a very good\nlocation for his run. Because his opening move\nwould be taking a ferry to Dover. So it looks like ferries take\nan hour and a half. That would cost him 900 points. He can afford it\nwith his starting budget. That's not great! I didn't expect to end up\nhere... in Calais. Let's stop for a second and\nlook at where he is. Okay. Let's take a look\nat where he is. He's  like  by...\nthe English Channel. Just Uber us exactly\n30 minutes to Calais. We'll end up on the edge of Calais \nand then we'll go from there. It says  \"No cars available \"\nand that seems bad. We need to hurry. Okay  good news on the\n\"Adam  ferry to England\" problem. It's 1 PM. The next ferry\nafter this is 1:50. They're not gonna be able\nto make that 1:50 ferry. The next ferry after that\nis 3:40. Even with our period of— our no-tagbacks period \nthere's the words— I think we can get to that. That almost means that I\nkinda wanna get caught earlier. But on the other hand \nI want budget. So that's kinda weird. No rideshare here. I mean  that says\nTaxi Dunkerque right there. Okay  okay. He asked if we were gonna\ntake the ferry to Calais. A lot of people\ntake the ferry in Calais. Did he say  \"I'm gonna take the ferry\"?\nThere's no way. It would be crazy if he did that. He's gonna take it  isn't he? Alright  1:02 PM.\nWe are back in business. Pulling my next card. \"Visit the top attraction.\" Okay  this should be easy.\nThis is not a big town. Well  bigger than I thought \nof course  but... ...let me look that up. The Bur— The Burghers of Calais. The Burghers of Calais. Okay. Oh  that is right by the train station!\nOkay  that's risky. That's gonna get me in a\nprime location to get caught. And... turns out that my strategy of\ngetting as far away as possible from it... Not great! So I gotta go\nto The Burghers of Calais. Alright  I've put the bags\nin sport mode. Goodbye  dragon. We gotta go. We gotta go get\nThe Burghers of Calais. You don't think he was\njust standing by the ferry to mess with us  do you? I wouldn't put it past him.\nYeah. He's moving. He's going... He's going... down... ...back across the bridge.\nMaybe he's not taking the ferry. The frickin' toll bridge is up! I need to get to that side\nto see the Burghers! This is bad. This bridge is moving\nvery slowly. I lost  like  five very crucial minutes. I can move. He appears to be potentially headed\nback to the train station  but... ...as far as I can tell  there aren't\nany trains for about an hour. Zooming in quite a bit  I think\nhe might be on a bus or something. Alright  see? That's the train station\nthey're about to pop out of. I'm sure they're looking\nat me on the tracker and wondering\nwhat the hell I'm doing! Merci! Okay.\nAlright. We ran out of time\non our 30 minutes  so we had to get him\nto let us out... ...at this random place.\nWe took it as far as we could. Oh  cop. Let's just run!\nOn the bright side  we're still here. Okay. There they are. The Burghers of Calais. Otherwise known as\nLes Bourgeois de Calais. Turns out the big fancy building \nthat was the Hôtel de ville I was looking for. There are the Burghers of Calais. I don't have time to go\non the right side of it. Now I need to list the\ntop five things I like about it. I like... the fact that... ...you look these guys up\non the Wikipedia pages  the Wikipedia pages\nliterally go to a listing about their part of the statue \nnot their actual names. The most famous thing they're known for\nis being in the statue. Do you know where\nwe have to turn? No! I also like the fact that apparently  it is to commemorate the\nFrench surrender to the English during the Hundred Years' War \nafter they sieged the place. And it's in a French city.\nIt's a French city... ...commemorating their surrender. It's very windy! I also like the fact that... ...it looks like... Looks like that guy is about\nto grab that guy's butt. That's cool. You okay? It sucks!\nBuddy  buddy  buddy. You gotta strap your backpack\nwith your waist strap. The waist strap isn't important.\nWhat are you talking about? The waist strap is the whole point.\nThe waist strap redistributes the weight  to be on your waist\ninstead of your back. Alright  I'll put on the waist strap. Actually  I mean \nthere's things I like about it. It actually is a pretty impressive statue. From what I remember\nfrom art history  making those clothing things\nis really hard on the statue. And they've done it really well. Alright  we're like... ...0.5 miles away now. Almost there! The last thing I love\nabout this statue: is that it's about to win me\n750 coins. Alright  Ben and Adam are gonna\ncatch up to me any second. I'm gonna pull another card \nbecause there are some cards that you just claim immediately  and would be huge if\nI got one of those. Okay  so there we go.\nTop card. \"Visit any museum.\" Ugh  20 minutes there. I can't do that. Okay. I'm just gonna get as far away\nfrom the station as possible. Okay  in the small chance\nthat they're not about to get off that train and catch me  I'm going to veto that card  so that I don't have to do it  and so that the veto period\nstarts now. It is 1:28. So in the small chance they don't—\nthat they're not about to catch me  veto period starts now. 0.3 miles! Almost there \nhe's still at that park. Yeah  what's he doing there? You know what?\nI changed my mind. I don't wanna go\ntoo far from the station  'cause I think it's actually\ngonna be advantageous for us  when we're trying to catch up to him \nto be close to the station. And it doesn't really change much\nby being further. I don't wanna actually delay\nthe catch too much  'cause I want it to be possible for us\nto get to that 3:40 ferry as Chasers  so that Adam cannot safely get\nfrom here to the UK. I wanna force him back into France.\nI don't want him to be safe. What I like about this is\nit shows confidence. They're gonna be frazzled at\nthe fact that I'm just sitting here. So it's been four minutes since\ntheir train should've gotten here  and the station is right there. Kinda feel like they\nshould be here by now. He should know that we are here  because even if we had\ntaken that train to Calais  we would've gotten here\nright about now. We should put on microphones. We should hide in the parking\nand put our microphones on. Okay  so Ben and Adam\nput their microphones on wrong and lost audio during the catch \nbut it's pretty straightforward. There's them tagging me.\nThere's me asking if they went to Dunkirk. Here's me laughing because\nthey totally went to Dunkirk. And back to the show! Art history moment.\nThis is a famous thing. You ready?\nAlright  so you've shuffled the deck. I have shuffled here.\nOne last shuffle  about to cut. Ready.\nGet to it. (slurred exclamation) There he goes. He's jaywalking. He's gonna try to go\nto the UK  most likely. It would be good for him to go to the UK.\nIt'd be good for him to go to the UK. And you cannot get a Eurostar from here. Even though the Eurostars\nphysically go through here. But you can in Lille. The problem is that he would\nnot have enough budget to go from here\ndirectly onto the Eurostar. He would have to do\na challenge here. I'm so glad that you thought this out. I'm taking a super-long train\nto Paris basically. It's like three hours long. And it's gonna use up all my coins \nbut it's... ...like basically my only option! So that is what I'm gonna do. My first choice would've been\nto get on the ferry to Dover  but that doesn't leave until 3:40  which means that they\nwould be able to catch up to me. Which sucks \n'cause that would've been awesome. But before I get on the train \nI'm gonna go ahead and pull my card. Top card. (sigh) Okay.\n\"Have a fast three-course meal.\" Um... Okay  that should be\npretty doable in Paris. Shouldn't be too hard.\nThat's a good reward. Then I can plan that out on the train.\nSo I feel fine about that. So it's 2:31. The train would've\nleft two minutes ago. It looks like maybe he's\nnot doing that train to Lille. And  I mean  what I expect if not \nhe's taking that train towards... Paris. Yeah.\nParis. And then maybe getting off\nsomewhere in between? I don't know. I'm not sure\nthat that's... the right move. Can he not get all the way to Paris? He can  it would just take him a really long time \nand I'm not sure where that would get him. 'Cause we could get to Paris\npretty easily  I think. I haven't looked yet \nbut I think that's better for us than him going to Lille. So  this whole journey... ...is going to cost a lot. Alright  so that's... ...1730 coins. So that means I only have 270 left. Which is a shame. But it's gonna be fine... I think. So  we think we have the...\nthe perfect play here. It's such a good move  honestly. Okay  so Adam left on the train to Paris. That train  it goes through Amiens. In a little bit after this \nthere's a train to Amiens that tracks the exact same route \nstopping at the exact same stations. And then if he continues onto Paris  we'll get there at 5:11 in Amiens \nand there's a 5:22 train to Paris. So we'll just directly get on another train \nonly lose a tiny bit  And we'll get into Paris \nyou know  I don't know exactly... About an hour. Yeah.\nAn hour behind him. Easy. This is such a good move. I am so excited. Let's do it. Love a good move.\nYeah. So  I'm gonna get to Paris\nat 5:29. They are gonna get to Paris... ...at 6:30. That's not amazing. (loud sigh) Okay. That's not the best ever. Okay! We have  what  like a minute? Less than a minute. While we wait...\nWe're not breaking the rules. ...we can...\nOh  it's 2:50. No  forget that. Okay  never mind.\nLet's go to the train station! Nous on reviant à Gare de Calais-Ville. I've been practicing\nmy French  Sam. How was that? Did you know that Sam speaks French? You've been doing it on camera. Only a little bit.\nOnly when necessary. Okie-dokie. Okay  we are transferring trains\nto the train to Paris  because Adam is headed there \n'cause he is crazy. Okay  if anyone tries to come in \nstart sneezing uncontrollably  okay? The fastest route to Paris\nthat they could have taken... ...which they almost certainly\nhave taken... ...gets here in an hour. Which means... ...I have enough time to go\nto the fast food restaurants near this train station\n— there are a bunch of them — and do the three-course meal. Then... I'll explain more of my plan... ...later once I'm...\nat one of the restaurants. When we get to Paris \ndo we want to track him down  or do we wanna try and...?\nYeah. I mean  there are a lot of train stations \nand we cannot let him leave Paris. If we let him leave Paris after\ndoing a challenge  we're screwed. Welcome to Paris! Okay... so... Gotta go to three\nfast food restaurants. First one needs to be an appetizer.\nAppetizer can be anything. Oh yeah  there's a Burger King. I'm gonna go with that\nfor appetizer. Thank you. Oh man. I like this challenge. It's very dumb. But that's what I like about it. That was really fast. Let's keep moving. I'm gonna do... ...Subway maybe? There's a Subway\nright around the corner. Subway's fast. And I can get a pretty small sandwich \nI would imagine. So here's kind of a weird thing. Adam is still in front of— (train horn zip) Oh  that was so scary! That was so scary!\nDoes that happen?! It's a train. Since trains go so fast\nnear each other— Okay  I'm sorry. Reset. So... We could just go\ndirectly where he is  or we could  like \ngo to Gare Montparnasse  and try to defend him from leaving. I don't want him getting on a train\noutside of Paris at Gare Montparnasse. Getting a thing with a\nbunch of bread was so stupid. I don't know when\nI'm gonna learn my lesson! So  as promised. My plan is basically\nto take evasive action. So  I looked at\nall my options tonight  trying to get somewhere\nbefore the rest period starts at 8. But... There's just nowhere that I can get.\nI can't really get much of anywhere  and everywhere I can get\nis pretty accessible. So I'm just gonna try to evade them \nwhile doing challenges  in Paris. I found a weird little train station called Massy-Palaiseau[mah-see pali-sairs] I think  that can get me to Rennes \nwhich is where I really wanna go. They're gonna think that\nI'm gonna be taking Montpar— Mont— Montparnasse[mont pair-a-naws] I think. Gare Montparnasse.[mont par-nas] But I'm not. And I'm hoping\nI can fake them out. They're gonna think\nI'm gonna take that train. But I'm actually gonna go\ndown south  the subway  to this weird station \nMassy... Palaiseau.[pali-sairs] Alright  I'm gonna get\nice cream at McDonald's. That should be easy to eat  and fast  and actually delicious. They don't have ice cream. Okay  whatever this is. Let's eat whatever this is. Great. That was super fast. Alright  done. Looks like he's on the move \nbecause he was down there. Now he's there.\nI don't know where he's going. The good news is it doesn't look like\nhe's going back in the station  which is good  because\nI don't want him getting on a train. I want him to be in Paris \nwhere we can catch him! So I've got just over a half hour\nuntil they get here. I'm gonna pull another card. Alright  here are the cards.\nI just take the top one. Is it good? \"Until the next time you get tagged  you cannot use your phone\nto research information.\" (weak  despondent chuckling) Okay. That's actually okay. Okay. I can do that. I'm just gonna have to figure out\nhow to navigate the subways. But this is gonna be surprisingly doable! Okay. Okay  good. Okay  I'm gonna pull\nanother card. So I mean  this is gonna be\nour first catch of Adam. And the risk is \nAdam's a good runner  and Adam's also willing to run  willing to make a fool\nout of himself in public. He's proved that time and time again. And he's extremely paranoid. And he's extremely paranoid. So I think we really have to be\noptimizing for sneaking up on him. Yeah  he's a— I don't wanna get in a\nfootrace with him. Because while I'm sure\nwe could eventually catch up  it's gonna take a while \nit's gonna wear us all out  and there's always a risk\nthat he quickly runs into Métro  and then quickly runs on a train or something \nand just gets completely away from us. And that's too big a risk  so... We gotta do everything possible\nto sneak up on him. Even if that means\ntaking some time to catch him. Main point is  we just cannot\nrisk him leaving Paris. Okay  next card. \"Use a fancy restroom. \"Use the restroom of a hotel\nthat costs more than $500 that night. You must actually use the restroom.\" (crackly) Okay. It's gonna be really hard... ...to figure out... how expensive...\na room is... at a hotel. I'm gonna have to ask! That is... ...not good! These are the subways.\nWhere am I? Oh god! They're gonna be here\nin 25 minutes. (soft whistle) \"Gare du Nord.\" Okay  I'm here. Okay. The Musée d'Orsay is south...\non the blue line. That I know is a fancy place. So what's the blue line?\nThat's the B line? Okay  I'm gonna take\nthe B... down. I'm gonna take the B down. Okay! Alright. Let's look for hotels. Hello. How much would\na room be for tonight? Not fancy enough. He said\nbetween one-something and two-fifty. Okay. The Albe Hotel. Let's try that. How much would\na room be for tonight? We're fully booked. Okay. Out of curiosity \nhow much would a room cost? Like  it's... ...150.\nOkay. It's between this price  150  200.\nThank you. 100  150. Not even close! Okay  I need a truly... like a truly mac-daddy \nnice hotel. Or I might have to veto this card  and I would really prefer\nnot to do that  'cause... ...if I veto it... Agh  if I veto it  then I can't\ntake any transport for half an hour! And that would suck! 'Cause I think they'll come\ncatch me! But I also don't wanna waste\na bunch of time on this! We're getting to Paris.\nHe must have messed up. I think he must have made a mistake. Or he  for some reason \nthought this was a good strategy. Again  that's what I'm\nreally worried of  is us just missing some\ncrucial element of this  and him just running away\nwith it. But  we'll see! I'm vetoing the card! I just don't think there's\nany way that I'm gonna be able to find a hotel that expensive  let alone...\ngo to the bathroom in it! Until 7 —\nit's 6:30 exactly  until 7 — I cannot use any\nforms of transportation. I'm gonna be a sitting duck! Which sucks! But I am allowed to walk around.\nI think that if I hide in the subway station  that I might have a chance \nand I actually... I actually brought something\nfor this exact possibility. So  let's get that going. Yay  beautiful Paris. Okay  that was perfect timing.\nTwo stops  okay? I brought disguises!

Just as a reminder  in order to win  you have to reach your designated\nfinish location while you're the Runner. If no one reaches their destination\nby the end of the two remaining days  then the win goes to\nwhoever's location is closest to the Runner\nwhen the clock runs out. Right now  Adam is in Paris\ntrying to earn enough coins to take a train to Rennes\ntomorrow morning. Thanks to pulling a Curse Card that means\nhe can't use his phone anymore  Adam had to veto his last challenge \nwhich means for the next 30 minutes  he can't take any form of\ntransportation. To make matters worse \nBen and I are minutes away from his location. I've lost his location. It looked like he was maybe moving. Oh no wait  it looks like\nhe's on Île de la Cité. Isn't that towards us?\nYeah. He literally could be anywhere. The tracker's showing me like\na massive radius right now. Well  that seems to suggest—\nWhat is he wearing again? He's wearing like a...\nlittle flannel shirt. Part one of the disguise... ...is this soccer football jersey. I never wear soccer football jerseys. Totally not my thing. I've got a wig. I got this bucket hat. I think if I'm like this in the subway \nI might be fine now. You're probably thinking  \"Well  Adam  what about your giant \nsuper recognizable backpack?\" That's a great point. And that's exactly why I\nbrought something for that... ...exact reason— (speaking in French) What's that?\nOui? I don't speak French. I'm sorry. I— I only speak English. Good to meet you. Let's move. I'll keep looking. What was he wearing again? I brought a trash bag  so I'm\ngonna put my bag in the trash bag. Alright. I'm gonna take my microphone off  'cause I think that is too obvious. And I'm gonna take\nthe phone off the tripod. Oh  there are too many people. It's good for us. It's good for us too  right.\nIt makes it hard to spot us. Especially 'cause he's not looking  but... He's somewhere here. Maybe he's spotted us\nand jumped in the Seine. I'm assuming that they're\non their way to my location now. That being the case \nI think it's time for me to take... ...my spot...\nin the giant subway. I just have to survive... ...for 20 more minutes... and I can take a subway\nsomewhere. I just think the tracker\nis not very accurate. So I think we just need to be\nsearching these streets with them. Heyo! It's John Green! What the (bleep)? What? John Green. We're filming Jet Lag!\nHey buddy! Hi! Hi!\nHi John Green! Oh my God.\nHow are you guys doing? Great. We're looking for Adam.\nOh my god. We are searching for Adam.\nI haven't seen Adam. People are gonna think\nthis is a scripted cameo! This is not a scripted bit.\nOh my god! That's my friend. I know him.\nOh my god  John Green. You're filming  right?\nYeah. I've come from a\nchampagne wine tour. We've come from ten  twelve\nhours of trains all day. We're very exposed. And Adam is like right here.\nGodspeed. Do you have any advice\nfor us finding him? None. We gotta go. When are you gonna be on this  John? Okay bye  John Green!\nBye  John! Just by the way  this\ndisguise is unbelievably hot. It's already hot\nin this subway station. This is like low-key unbearable. What just happened?\nI don't know. It was John Green. That— That was not scripted. We can't worry about\nJohn Green right now! We need to get outta the— We're halfway between buses. Okay  watch out  watch out. That was amazing. We knew John Green was in Paris \n'cause he tweeted about it  and we were like  it'd be so funny\nif John Green cameo'd on Jet Lag. (wheezing) I was like \n\"That doesn't sound like Adam!\" That was genuinely\none of the strangest things that has ever happened! Okay  okay.\nConcentrate  concentrate. We can think about\nhow unbelievable that is... Okay  so it shows Adam\nback in the river  but I think the majority of the time \nthe tracker showed in these streets. So I think we need to\nspend our time searching. It would make sense that\nthe tracker would not be accurate in such dense crowds. Yes. So let's methodically\nsearch these streets. He's gonna be so mad about it  losing his shot to meet\nhis hero  John Green. I know  well... he shoulda\ngotten tagged sooner. Alright. Only three minutes left.\nI think I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna start\nheading towards any subway. Just get on and peace out. (distant live saxophone) Yeah  let's advance\nkind of behind the cars. Oh no  there's a subway exit \nentrance up there. He could be going into that. We're like right there. Okay. Well  it looks like he's in the block. Like he's in a building. Yeah. I mean  again  just like \nit's not that accurate. Well  could he have gone down to\nthat subway station  maybe? Just by the way  I'm not\ncheesing the GPS by doing this. I have service. I checked my tracking phone\njust to make sure I had service. I didn't do anything else\nwith them  but... I'm not like making it so that\nthey can't find me without service. I have service.\nIt's just  this is a maze. So I think it's fair game. Okay. Okay. What does the tracker say now? So  it's back to that location. It's back to that location\nin the river right there. So I think we need to\ncovertly scan that area. Oh  he can't be\non that boat  can he? It shows him in the river.\nHere  Apple Maps now says it too. But he...\nWhy would he be on a boat? Alright  I have to wait a little bit\nfor the train I'm taking. So I'm hiding in a little corner. I'm gonna pull a card really quick. (sigh) Do a hundred squats. \"For a full squat  your thighs\nmust be parallel to the ground. You may move or rest\nbetween squats.\" Okay. No time like the present  I guess. There's no way that he's\non a boat  but he could... There's a Métro station\nthat goes under the Seine  right? Yeah  but he's been there\nfor a while. Could it be worth just...\ngoing down there and checking? Just not sure why he would've\nbeen there for that long. Yeah  'cause we've been here\nfor a good fifteen minutes  and it's like rush hour. So I can't imagine any trains... (sneeze) ...would've taken longer than\nfifteen minutes to come here. So I'm not sure why he would\nbe in the Métro station. Maybe he was being indecisive. Maybe. There's so many people\ngetting on this train. Uh-oh  oh no. Both trackers moved. Okay  trackers moved east. Okay.\nTowards Gare de Lyon. Should we go there? I mean he's east  so\nhe's not here anymore. I don't know if he's going to Gare de Lyon \nbut he's going that way. Oh man  it takes two different... Ah (bleep)! Alright  let's go  let's go. Where would he have been here? He's like almost all the\nway to Gare de Lyon now. Well  we should go there too. I mean  if he's trying to set\nhimself up to take a train first thing in the morning...\nYeah  we gotta be there. I have no idea where I am! Okay. He's gone past the station. What I think that means is\nI think he's taken RER. Oh yeah.\nHe's on the RER yellow line. Where does that take him? Just away  away from the city. Where am I? I'm at the Bibliothèque  here. So tomorrow \nI just want to take the C... ...all the way down to\nMassy-Palaiseau. That feels doable \nbut I don't wanna do it now. 'Cause I'm worried that\nthey'll figure out my plan. Mmh  okay. Here's what would be\na good move. So... the RER C line\ngoes to Massy. And in Massy  there is... There are TGVs to Rennes.\nLet's look in the morning. Okay. Only a half hour until\nthe rest period starts. If I can last until then... ...that'll be a really good\nstarting place. Alright  let's see how many squats\nI can do right off the bat. Where could he be going? He's showing as being at\nBibliothèque François Mitterrand. I think let's get on the one \nand get off at Gare de Lyon  unless we can figure out\nsomething's changed. Just to get towards him for now.\nRight. 'Cause we're only 29 minutes\nuntil the rest period. That is a potential place\nwhere we could intercept him. Yeah. I think I have about ten-ish\nminutes where I'm still safe. So... One. Two. He's still there. Here's our train. We're headed to Gare de Lyon. Fourteen. Fifteen. Is he still there?\nYep. Still there. I mean  we could just\ntry and get as physically close to him\nas possible. I guess that's probably\nthe best bet at this point. So we'll get out there \nand we can cross that bridge and then run down\nthat street maybe. Yeah. I mean  maybe we could\nget him  I don't know. 21. 22. You know what  I'm gonna make this\nbe more out of the way. I'm blocking people. 23. 24. 25. You know  I don't like\nmy back being turned. We have eleven minutes.\nIt says it's a seventeen minute walk. I think this way's better. Can you just get\nas close as possible? 68  69  70. You know \nI was not in the meeting where this challenge was\ncome up with  I was on vacation. And I remember seeing it\nafterwards and being like  \"Hey Ben  a hundred squats? That seems like a lot!\" And he was like  \"It'll be fine.\" 31. Whew. Seventy— 72  73. Where do we have to go?\nWhere is he? Okay  actually this one. 87  88  89  90. Okay. Ten more.\nAlmost there. God  I hope they don't\nshow up right now! 'Cause I am not\ngonna be able to run! Is he still there? Yeah  we need to get down. Down? 98  99  100. It's like the dumbest thing\nwe've ever come up with. Alright  that's another 500 coins. That's more than enough to safely get me\nall the way to Saint-Malo. He's over that bridge? Yeah. I am gonna go ahead\nand draw my next card here. Here's the deck  and here's the top pick. \"Go exactly one mile. \"Close your eyes  spin in a circle \nand point in a random direction. \"You must go as close as possible  \"on publicly accessible land \nto that location exactly one mile in that direction.\" Well... Um. Adam is down there. Down there? Okay. It's that way. What's that way? It takes me around\nfifteen minutes to walk a mile. So I'm just gonna go about\nfifteen minutes in that direction. I really hope that the\naudience feels that this is an appropriate interpretation\nof the challenge. I am doing my very best. Should we hide? Well  he's still far away  but I think we might wanna\nstay on this side. 'cause you see  he moved from— Here  you wanna show?\nYeah. He moved from there to there.\nSo I think he's gonna cross. It's a big river here. It's very pretty. That's cool. Okay yeah \nhe's crossing the bridge. Okay. I look so stupid! The wall comes to an end! This is taking embarrassingly long! Thought I saw Sam and Ben. I think it was just\na jogger or something. Oh  that's it. That's it. It's 8 PM. We're done. Oh my god. Okay. This is a great spot. We're very close to Adam. Okay  so let's show\nwhere Adam is. So we're there. Adam just went there.\nSo that's his spot. \"12th Arr.\nRue de L'Ambroisie.\" This sign... is sandwich sign. I'm gonna be exactly here. What I like this spot is... we can cut him off there \nif he's going to go to Gare de Lyon. And pretty much all the transit\nis from Gare de Lyon. So I like our spot. So these are the spots that we're\ngonna start at at 6 AM tomorrow. Yeah. Okay! But here's the thing \nwe gotta go. Cause he's probably gonna\ngo to the same hotels as us. We don't want him to spot us now. (bleep)\nSo let's go back. Okay. Good night  everyone.\nGood night. Okay.\nGood morning. The second it turns six \nwe gotta run. We gotta run that way. So Adam is one block that way\nand one block that way. Yeah  so we gotta cross the street\nand get one block in just as quickly as possible. Oh  it's 6:00. Let's go. Okay  we're back on.\nFirst thing's first. I don't want to do this \nbut I am vetoing the walk one mile card.\nI've thought about it. And I just think\nI cannot accurately get to exactly one mile away\nwithout using my phone. And if I can't do that  I don't think\nthat I can actually complete the card. That sucks though.\nI really don't want to veto it  because that again means that\nI'm a sitting duck for the next half hour. I can't take any forms of transportation. Do you have his location? Yeah. It looks like he might be going\ndown this way towards this street. We sure? Well  'cause he was like here  I think. Now he's like here. Okay  let's wait for a movement. I'm trying to get on a\n7:40-something train at a place called\nMassy-Palais— something that I researched before I wasn't\nallowed to use my phone anymore. It's like a weird train station\nthat's really out of the way. You have to get to it on the subway. If I can get on that train  pretty sure I can get\nall the way to Saint-Malo  which is only one stop\naway from getting to Jersey. Let's cross this way. The question is  does he turn\ntowards us or cross the bridge? Oh no  he's crossing the bridge.\nLet's go. Yeah. Oh  he's going to...\nnot the station that we thought. That's so weird. Maybe he was trying\nto throw us off yesterday... when he was going the opposite direction\nfrom the station he wanted. (reject buzzer) (reject buzzer) Okay. For some reason  the tickets that\nI bought yesterday are not working. I need to find a way\nto buy new tickets. But I don't know if I can do that. 'Cause my debit card doesn't\nseem to be working  because I think my bank thinks\nthere's fraud on my card  'cause I'm buying things in Europe. And I cannot call my bank to tell them\nthere is not fraud on my card  because I cannot use my phone! We just gotta hope that\nthe RER doesn't come in like the next five minutes. But our chances are good \n'cause it's early. Come on. Come on.\nCome on. Purchase tickets. Come on. One ticket.\nJust one ticket. Please dear god  work. Come on. They didn't take it. It's not taking it. This is not good. It's gonna be right down there. There's a train coming. It's this direction.\nOkay  you go that way. I'll go this way. Box him in. Excuse me.\nCould you swipe me in? I can give you 10 euros \nbut my card's not working. Could you swipe me through? Money?\nYeah  I only have cash. Okay. Thank you. He definitely wasn't on there. I walked from side to side. Is he still back there? Yeah  but in a big circle. Okay  let's go... I don't know where he'd go. Or if he even got on anything. Okay. Just gotta go to the C. There's so many different Cs.\nI know I wanna go south. So just gonna hope for the best. There's one at 6:31.\nThat's really good. That's the exact time\nI wanted there to be. Okay  come on. I mean  there's a chance\nhe's still in the station. Mm-hmm. Okay  I'm hanging out at the\ntop of these stairs here  'cause I'm hoping that'll\nmake the GPS look weird. And also because if they show up \nI have good exit options. He moved again\non the tracker for me. Do you think we should\ngo above ground? Like he moved\nfurther down the street. I mean  we could go \nbut his tracker is far too big for him\nto be above ground. I don't know if we can trust that. We haven't validated that at all. It seems like his tracker's\njust not very accurate. 'Cause it keeps bouncing. So do you think we should\ngo above ground? I guess so. Okay. I mean  I just tried\ntaking this guy one stop. Wait at the next station\nfor the next train. Okay  this is not where\nI intended to go  but this is an option. I just saw myself in the window.\nI look so stupid. Alright. Train's left. God  I hope this is\ngoing the right way. No movement? No  I got some movement. Now it shows him here. Oh (bleep) \nhe went the other way. So which—\nHe's on the RER. Okay. How do we get on that? I don't know if we want to get on it. Let's see if we can figure out\nwhere he's going and cut him off. Okay. We're on the move. So far  so good. Yeah  that's the RER yellow line. That doesn't go anywhere useful. Goes to Orly. Yeah  but there's—\nI don't think there's any flight that would get him anything useful. Yeah  Rennes doesn't have\na flight from Orly. London? Saint-Malo doesn't have\na flight from Orly. That's hypothetically possible \nbut would he have the money? The only thing I could imagine is the TGV to Brest and Rennes\nfrom Massy at 7:47. But that's an hour from now. Well  if he's doing that \nthen we have time to catch up. I mean  that's on the yellow line \nso that's like a smart move. I mean  he is headed that way. Just taking that unbelievably\nstupid wig off for a second. It's so hot! Oh man. I keep looking around.\nI know they're not on here. I mean  I don't know \nbut I'm pretty sure. I think we have to assume\nhe's going to Massy. Yeah  could we— I mean  that's the smartest move. Let's go to Massy \n'cause it's one hour until a train to exactly where he wants to go. Okay. Okay. Calling an Uber. Okay  so we have to exit—\nYou try first. (reject buzzer) Oh god! Ugh  why is there—\nThere's no human! Can't I just go through with you? Then you'd get in trouble. No  I mean  if we're exiting that... Well  we can exit anyway.\nI think the exits are here. (distant buzzer) Oh  they just did that. Okay.\nGet right behind me. Okay  come on. Uber there. Here Ben  come on. Okay  this is Juvisy. I think this is gonna be fine. So  according to this... ...train will be here in 11 minutes. And it does go to Massy-Palaiseau. So  so far so good. It must be stuck. I mean  he's been at\nthis Juvisy station for a couple of minutes. Seems like we have a decent bit\nof time before Adam gets here. Yeah.\nThis is where he's headed. Let's take a look. Well  a good  good period\nto get into position. I wonder what Sam and Ben's\nplan is right now. Are they trying to get here? Or  and this would be\nunfortunate. Have they figured out that\nI'm going to Massy-Palaiseau? That wouldn't be good. 'Cause they might be able\nto beat me there. But I don't think\nthey could  actually. Oui.\nMerci. The RER C. That's the one that Adam\nis heading here on. We should find the exits and then try to block off\nas many as possible. And catching him\nbefore he notices us. Yep. I think that's it. Alright. On the train to Massy-Palaiseau. Alright  I think\nwe might be able to do this. It looks like this might be quite good  'cause it looks like\nthis might be the only exit. You see? It seems like there's a big choke point. Let's verify that. How far is he? Looks like he... He's still got some ways.\nOkay. Gosh  it's so pretty. And made even prettier by the fact\nthat Ben and Sam aren't here. Okay. I think he's on the C \ntowards Versailles. It must be the 7:25. So we have twelve minutes. Alright. Massy-Palaiseau is the next stop. So... The train  I know \nleft 7:40-something  which means they're gonna have\nabout 25 minutes to try to get to me. Once they realize I'm stopped there. I don't think they could make that \nbut we'll see. We knew Adam would be\ngetting in on these tracks. And the only exit was up these\nstairs into this long walkway. So our plan was simple:\nbox him in. We should do the\nbox-him-in strategy. Post up here? Well  one of us posts up\nbehind that and stays hidden. One of us posts up on\nthe other side of this hallway  and then as soon as he goes in \nwe start kind of closing in on him. Okay  so let's get on like a call.\nSo we can coordinate. Test  test. Can you hear me? Yeah.\nOkay. Alright. We made it into Massy-Palaiseau. This is absolutely huge. It looks like... ...on the tracker that\nhe's pulling in right now. Oh  there's a train pulling in. Okay  so that must be it. You see that? That must be it.\nYeah. Okay. Alright  now's the moment. Unless they can get here\nin the next 25 minutes... ...I'm making it to Saint-Malo today. Alright.\nAre passengers getting off yet? It doesn't seem like\nthere's a huge influx yet. But now people\nare starting to come out. Okay  I can see\nthe platform from here. I have not yet seen Adam. Alright. Let's find out when that\ntrain actually does leave. Alright. People are really starting\nto come out now. And you have him on the tracker?\nHe's definitely here now? He is here. Okay. Can I find the right ticket\nto get out of here? Let's find out. Oh  I... I see him. I see him. I see him.\nI see him. I see him. I see him. Oh  he's wearing—\nNo  he's wearing a green shirt. Green shirt. What color hat? He's not wearing a hat. Okay. Let's try this one. (reject buzzer) Does not like that. I think he's having trouble. Can't let him get it back on the RER.\nYeah  he's having trouble. He's having trouble\ngetting through the gates. Hates that  okay. Oh  nice. He's wearing a green shirt.\nNo hat. What do I do?\nIs he in disguise? What... do I do here? He must have bought the wrong ticket. 'Cause yeah  when you go\nfurther outside of the city center  you need a ticket that...\nfor like the outside zones. Excuse me? You can't just get the\none-year regular one. So that's gotta be what he did. That's gonna take him many— He's probably gonna have to\nfind a human for that. I can't. It won't. I don't know how to get through. Okay  it's not good tickets. Okay  how do I get—\nI have a bunch. Claim doesn't change. I'm gonna back up. Oh. Yeah  he's totally in disguise. He's wearing a shirt\nthat he would never wear. Thank you. He's just getting through now.\nSomeone just let him through. Okay. He's going down the bridge. Okay.\nI'm following. Okay  let me know\nwhen he is far enough in that he can't get back to you\nfaster than you can cut him off. Alright. Okay? These are subways. (terrified shout)\n(chuckle) You got him?\nI got him. Oh  that sucks so much! No! Woo-hoo-hoo! No! How did you know\nI was coming here? 'Cause Sam is a train genius. (groan) I was so sure that this was like \nyou weren't gonna know about this. I have so much footage of you\nstruggling to get through this thing. Ugh  you're in disguise \nyou bastard. What is this shirt? Shut up. Is that a wig? Adam has a wig. Is this a wig? This is a wig. Oh my god. Come on over here  Sam. Oh god.\nThat's so frustrating. I really thought I had it. You were so close to leaving Paris. I just was so sure\nthat you were gonna think I was gonna go not funny with that. Yeah. I mean  again \nthere were... lots of times— And also \nhow did you beat me here? 'Cause the fastest way here I took  which was the frigging C. Fastest train. Did you take—\nor did you cab here? Maybe. Where's his wig?\nI wanna see your wig. That's hilarious. (laughs) Oh my god  we're about to be\non Google Street View. Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait. Jet Lag feature! Ugh  I was so— There's— I'm gonna look like\nsuch an idiot in the edit  'cause there's all this footage\nof me being like  \"Alright  I got here.\nI'm feeling really good.\" \"Now that I'm here  I think\nthere's no way that they could get...\" Oh  that will be so good. Agh  okay. Alright  I'm doing a final shuffle. Okay Ben  it is... 7:46.\n7:46. Which means that at 8:31... ...we'll start coming after you. Godspeed!\nBye  gentlemen. Good luck. Goodbye! See you in Borkum! Yep. I think he's screwed.\nI don't think he has any points. This episode of Jet Lag is\nunfortunately over. However  you can watch the\nnext episode right now on Nebula. That's in appreciation\nof the fact that this show literally could not exist financially without\neveryone who signed up for Nebula. So they get every episode\none week early  always one week ahead\nof YouTube. Right after that  of course \nyou should watch Crime Spree. That was kind of our\npilot season of Jet Lag. We made it before we even\ncalled it Jet Lag: The Game. And it was before we figured out all the health and safety\nrules that we needed. So it's kind of the most\nchaotic season of Jet Lag ever. I would definitely give it a watch.\nIt's absolutely as fun  but a little bit maybe less polished\nthan the rest of the Jet Lag seasons. And then right after that \nyou can watch Extremities. That's another series we make \nand we make this whole show about how and why the world's\nmost remote human settlements exist. You know  these places\nthat are some of the hardest places in the world to go to. Then right after that  there's this\ndocumentary on CuriosityStream. It's called\nRent A Family  Incorporated. It's about this agency in Japan\nthat rents out actors to serve as fake family members\nin different social situations. It's a really interesting documentary.\nIt's bizarre. It's fascinating. But the good news is all of this \nboth CuriosityStream and Jet Lag  is available through a bundle deal\nwith a special offer for Jet Lag viewers at\ncuriositystream.com/jetlag. If you go to that link \nour link  you get both streaming sites\nfor an entire year  for just $15 — actually\na little bit less — $14.79. That's a crazy good deal \nand believe it or not  that actually really helps\nsupport us financially. This show only exists\nbecause of how many people have gone and signed up\nfor that bundle deal. So make sure to click\nthe button on screen  or head to\ncuriositystream.com/jetlag. You get access to both streaming sites\nfor less than $15 a year. And you'll be supporting us \nso thanks in advance for your support. Check \"Massey train station\"\nfor Street View  to tell us if we—\ntell us if we made it. Let me see. Even if it's years\nin the future  check. Tell us if we made it on\nGoogle Street View  please."

        "transcript": "Welcome back to\n\"Tag Across Europe.\" You're watching episode four \nso make sure you're caught up on episodes one through three. Or don't.\nI'm just a disembodied voice. To recap  the game ends when\na Runner reaches their end location  or at the end of 72 hours\nwhen the win goes to whoever's end location is\nclosest to the current Runner. Right now it's the\nmorning of day two. Ben and I just caught Adam\nhere in Massy-Palaiseau. That means Ben's the new Runner \nand he has 45 minutes to get outta Paris before\nwe can start chasing him. The only problem is... getting outta Paris\nis gonna take him at least an hour. Okay  I just need\nto get on any train. This is not a great spot. There are not that many... ...actual trains out of here. So I think I need to get\non an RER  and get to a better station. I got you a pain au chocolat. Aww! Merci. He's still up there. Okay. I mean  the question is... I'm not sure what he's\ngoing to do. I mean.... He's gotta do a challenge. He doesn't have any money. I think what he's gonna\nhave to do is go to Paris  and gotta do a challenge\nand take evasive action. Alright  so really the only stations\nthat have trains to the general direction\nI wanna be going would be Gare du Nord\nor Gare de l'Est. Both of which\nare an hour from here. So they're gonna be\nchasing me before... ...I even get on a train \nif I can. The station for him that matters\nis Gare du Nord. Right  right  yeah.\nThat's what he has to get to. Or... yeah  Gare du Nord.\nI mean... Arguably we could just go\nto Gare du Nord  and he would show up there  I bet. And honestly it wouldn't\nbe the worst idea. Okay. That's my RER. I'm gonna take this... ...and then I gotta transfer once \nand then I'll be at Gare du Nord  and I'm literally just\ngonna get on the first train I can get on\nonce I get there. Has he moved yet? Right here. Let's see. Still there. That's live. You know  Adam and Sam\nare over there  probably laughing up a storm \nprobably saying  \"Ben's not even gonna get outta Paris.\nHe just got on a train.\" First of all  that's the\nbest I could do  okay? Second of all  at least I'm\nnot wearing a wig. Ben is very far from his location. He's the furthest of all of us\nfrom his location right now  and I'm almost certain\nhe has the least coins. Yeah  I think we'll be able\nto get him relatively quickly. So I've looked at\nmy train options  and... ...there's a 9:07 to Amiens. I would just barely make it\nto the station by then... ...and be cutting it real close. But there's a 9:19... to a place called Saint-Quentin.[sahn-quen-tin] I'm mispronouncing that.\nI'm very sorry. But that is my direction.\nI can afford that train. And it would line up\npretty nicely with my schedule. Where's he going? North? Yeah  north.\nInto the city? Okay  good. I think that's what we want. We've got what  another\n20-something minutes? Yeah. So about 20  23 minutes \n24 minutes. Yeah. I don't think... ...that Adam and Sam\nwould be able to catch me in the station...\nbefore I got on that train. I mean  obviously it's very close. But that's exciting content  so. That's the best I can do for you. Go!\nOkay  okay. Okay. I got it.\nGot em? Over here.\nTwo minutes until we leave. Okay. Incredible work. Made it to... Saint-Michel. Now I'm gonna dilly-dally\na little bit here because the longer I can go\nwithout them knowing... ...which station I'm going to... ...you know  a better of a shot\nI have getting out of Paris. And look  let's be honest. It would be embarrassing\nif I didn't get outta Paris  right? Ben will know that\ngoing to Gare du Nord is the very obvious place\nfor him to end up. He knows that we know that that is\nthe most likely place for him to go. It's possible that he will instead\nattempt to go anywhere else. Maybe that he knows\nthat we know. Okay  I've made it to Gare du Nord. It's 9:07  so I've missed\nthe train to Amiens. But it's fine  because... ...the train to Saint-Quinton[sahn-ken-tawn]—\nQuint—[kint] Please forgive me  is better. Anyway  because\nit's a much smaller hub  so I think it's gonna— they're gonna have\nmore trouble getting there  assuming that...\nthe train leaves with me on it before they get here \nwhich is not a guarantee. So now I've just gotta figure\nout where that train is. He's at Gare du Nord. My guess is he will get on\nwhatever train he can afford just to get out of Paris.\nCan't imagine there'll be much. It's thirteen. Thirteen. Okay. Thirteen.\nThirteen's over there. Oh  I just gotta get on this train. Hey  we just missed it. Wait  did we?\nYeah  it left at 9:30. Agh! Let's get on this train. It turns out that asking \n\"Where is train? Where is train?\" in broken French\nin a French train station... is not very helpful \nbut I did make it on the train. So I'm just praying that it leaves\nbefore Sam and Adam get here. How long will this take\nto get us there? Pretty quick. It's only one stop\nbefore Gare du Nord. So  I think we have a good shot\nof catching him right away. Wow. Poor Ben. This is us. This is a problem. But there are no other trains\nI could get on right now. And I already spent my budget\non this train. So I just have to pray the train\nisn't delayed a full 20 minutes. Oh gosh! Alright. We're here. Is he still at this station? Yep. Okay  it still shows him\nin the station. (conductor speaking French) I don't know what she said  but I hope it was  like \n\"We're going.\" I hope that's French for \n\"We're heading out.\" We're not. So the name of the game: Let's not get seen.\nLet's methodically search. We need to see him\nbefore he sees us. But this is tough \ndoing an indoor search. Yeah.\nBecause the tracker is not accurate. It's not accurate  and also...\nthis whole place is huge. Yeah  massive.\nAnd a labyrinth. Okay  I've got my backpack on. If I see them\ncoming down the train  I'm just gonna... hop off and... ...speedy-walk away. I don't think that's\ngonna get me very far  but I don't have\nany other options right now. Like  just to give you a sense\nof what's happening: There are stairs. There are... This is massive—\n...like plat— This is one of the biggest\ntrain stations in Europe. And I bet you anything he's doing\neverything he can not to be found. (whispering) Three minutes. I'm sweating. But he must be doing\na challenge. I guess. So... He's probably— We should definitely\nbe looking at shops and stuff. There are a lot of shops  so. This place is huge. The train is moving. Oh  I really didn't think I was\ngonna make it outta here. It's looking good for Team Ben. This is gonna be\na lot harder than I thought. Yeah. Oh no  he left. No! Nooo! Where's he going?\nWhat train just left? Can we look at that? I didn't. I saw one that didn't\nshow up on Google. Crap! It was a P. I forget what it was.\nIt was something with a P. No  it's too late\n'cause it already left. And it's not showing it.\nSomething with a P. Something with a P? Okay  well let's look at all\nthe lines that leave from here. It looks like I'm gonna get into... ...Saint-Quinton[saint cue-taw(n)]... ...at around 11  and\naccording to what I can find  it seems like Sam and Adam\nprobably can't get there until at least 1:30  but... Look  they're smart.\nI'm sure they can figure out some clever  crazy way\nto get there earlier than that. So I don't want to\nstick around quite that long. He's not on this route \nout Paris Nord. He's on this route.\nBut that's worse because— That's bad  'cause there's four different routes\nthat go that way. Maybe it's one of these.\nOoh! I don't know what this H is \nbut it goes to Persan. It goes to Persan?\nOkay  okay  okay. 9:36. That's what he got.\nYeah  9:36. That's gotta be it. Okay.\nWell  hmm... No  I think that's right. My strategy this time around is\nI'm gonna try and go... ...from relatively small city\nto relatively small city. Because I think they're just\ngonna have trouble predicting where I'm going\nand actually getting to the little towns where I am... ...than if I were in\na bigger city like Lille  which has a lot of ways\nto get there. I don't know if this strategy\nwill work  but we'll see. We just missed a train to Persan  Like one minute. It was at 10:01.\nNo! No! It's at 10:02. That sucks. Well  10:34  so we have\n30 minutes. Let's get tickets. Alright  tickets.\nHere's that. Wait a minute. (indistinct) Wait  that's not Persan.[person] Let me go back to the map.\nHe's way past Persan. (bleep) Mmmh  there was a 9:44... ...to Compiègne.\nLeft late. Yeah  it left a few minutes late. But that makes sense. 'Cause we were surprised\nhe stayed here so long. Yeah. And that was— Okay  let's check\nhow we could get there. There's a 10:34.\nLet's get towards that. So... Fifteen?\nYeah. Oh  nice. Man. Close the door and\nlook antisocial. Yep  we go through Tergnier.\nYeah. So we're going on the\nexact same route. That's perfect. Okay  great. Okay. Bienvenue à... ...this place. I don't have a lot of time. It's nearly 11  and I want\nto get on a 12:15 train  So... I'm gonna go try and\npull a card as soon as I can. And hopefully it's\nsomething I can... ...manage to do here\nin under an hour. We will get there  assuming\nwe're not also delayed  at 12:16. That's a good hour. Yeah  that's an hour \nan hour-fifteen. So he knows when\nhe has to get out of there. Probably. I mean  there's always a question\nof if he'll be able to earn the coins\nto keep moving anyway. In order to get on\nalmost any train  I have to earn some more.\nSo  it's time to pull a card. Oh. Eat the national dessert. We are in France  so the dessert\nwe've chosen is profiteroles. I think profiteroles are\npretty common. I bet they're somewhere\nhere that I can get them. I'm gonna do some research\nand look around. It's not a huge town. So hopefully \nit's not too far away. And also I'm pretty hungry again. So  I could really use some\nprofiteroles. That sounds lovely. Okay  see you in a minute. What are you doing  Sam? I'm uploading Jet Lag! We're filming this as season two\nis still going out. What episode's going up today? This is episode four \nreleasing on YouTube  the finale releasing on Nebula. Hey  did you know that the episodes\ngo up one week early on Nebula and you can sign up\nfor just $14 and— So  I did a little bit of research. It seems like there's\na pastry shop that's literally right across\nthe bridge here  like three minutes away. So hopefully they have\nprofiteroles. I don't think that profiteroles\nare that uncommon. It's like every little town\nyou go to in this country is like the most beautiful place\nyou've ever seen. I mean  look at this. Oh my god! Oh my god. He's on the move  folks! Looks like he's going into the city.\nSo he is doing a challenge. Which is good \n'cause that means he... ...doesn't have the budget \nand needs to earn budget  but is bad because\nit means he's earning budget. Bonjour. Vous avez des profiteroles? Profiteroles? No? Merci. They did not have profiteroles. And I've been looking at other places\nthat might have profiteroles. and I found a restaurant\nthat has them  but it doesn't open until noon. And if I go there\nand try and get profiteroles  I don't think I'm gonna\nmake that 12:15 train. I think my best bet\nright now is... ...to veto the card \neat the veto period  and just hope I am able to do a\nquick one before I get out of here. What I'm really worried about is the fact that Ben has a\n12:16 train to Amiens  which is exactly when\nwe're supposed to get in. So I don't think we could\nmake that connection. But good news is we get into the station before Saint—\nSaint-Quentin... ...which is called Tergnier... ...at about 12:10  I think. And there seems to be\na 12:26 to Amiens. From there  it would get in\nonly 15-20 minutes after him. That seems promising.\nThat seems promising. The only problem is\nwe would get to this station  we would get to the decision point  before he would get on\nthe train to Amiens. The only other possibility \nand this would be another mistake  is like  this train is actually a\nreally quick way to get to Brussels. Right  but if we got out  if we did our plan of\ngetting off early... Yeah. ...he could get on this train... Yeah  because\nwe're gonna have to... ...and get to Brussels.\nWe're gonna have to get off this before. It's almost— It's a situation where\nI think it would be a mistake  because he probably thinks we're\non this train to Saint-Quentin. But if he makes that mistake \nhe might actually win  or get away\nif we do our move. So it's like  oof. Oh god.\nLet's get ready. Oh god  oh god.\nShould we get off? I don't—\nI think— O-O-Okay. Hold on. There's a bee. My veto period is complete. I've been doing some thinking\nand here's what I'm gonna do. If I can't complete this next challenge \nI'm stuck here either way. I just— I don't have\nenough to get outta here. So... I can't veto the next card\nor I get caught either way. So in that spirit \nI'm going to buy... ...the powerup that doubles\nmy next reward or my next veto penalty. Because... I guess my next veto penalty\nis gonna screw me either way. And with that active  I'm gonna\ngo ahead and pull my next card. (despondent chuckle) Oh no. Okay  estimate your city's population. I only have one guess  and if\nI am off by more than 25%  this card is automatically vetoed. The good thing is this is a\nreally quick one and it rewards a lot. The bad thing is that there's a very\ngood chance that I get this wrong  because I am not very smart. Okay  we're basically there.\nWe gotta decide. Oh god.\nWe have to get off here. Okay  you know Ben better. Can you get— If he went to Amiens \nwhere would he go next? He would go—\nLike  is there anything good? I don't know. We don't have\ntime to look it up. I— Look  it's a total guess  but my guess is that\nhe would go to Amiens. Okay. We need to get off then.  (groan) Okay. Okay. Just so that you're clear\non what we're doing. We have just gotten off\na stop before Saint-Quentin  which is where Ben is \nbecause there is a better train here that goes to Amiens \nwhich is where we think he's going. But... He could actually have\na really good route to Brussels by just getting on this exact train\nwhen it gets to Saint-Quentin. We are hoping that he\nwon't do that  because he'll think that\nwe're on it. But if he doesn't realize\nthat we should be on it... Yeah.\n...then he'll get on it. That was just like a pure\nflip-a-coin kind of thing. Oh  it is... It really could go either way. Yeah. It's like three levels of game theory. Yeah. I've been walking around\na little bit. I'd like to think that\nI've given myself... ...some perspective  but... ...unfortunately... ...I don't think it helps\nvery much at all. So I think I just have to\nput in a guess. I'm just— The number 60 000\nis calling to me. So that means the population\nis between 45 000 and 75 000. Then I will be correct  and otherwise\nthe card gets automatically vetoed  and I'm in a one hour\nveto penalty. Which would be rough. So let's find out if I was right. Comment below if\nI'm a (bleep)-ing idiot. Oh  my friends. Oh  Team Ben. The number that is coming up\nis 55 000. But that is within the\ncorrect range  which means I just got\n2 000 freaking coins. And that means...\nWhat time is it? It's 11:53. I have time to get on that train to (bleep). I can't believe I got that right. Okay. Okay. ♪ Oh my god  oh my god \nI'm getting on the train ♪ ♪ I'm the best at this... game ♪ ♪ Sam and Adam are gonna lose ♪ ♪ I'm going all the way to Borkum ♪ Okay. He's at the train station. We will not know for\nfifteen minutes which way he's going. There's the train leaving that Ben\nhopefully is not about to get on. God  if he gets on the train\nthat we were just on  that we got off...\nI would be so frustrated. Oh my god. Gun to my head \nI thought this was the right call. Yeah. And standing off the train now \nI don't regret my decision. Okay  little gameplay update.\nI got a little pain au chocolat. I'm here ten minutes before\nthe train's here. I'm feeling good. I don't think that Adam or Sam\ncould be close  but you never know. I'm so stressed. Ugh  I hope we\nmade the right decision. Alright  off to... Wait until it's made\nsome real movement. I mean  it's... Oh  no. It's starting to go north\na little bit. I will say that. Yeah  it's still in the station.\nIt could just be GPS error. But it's pretty consistent. No  oh no.\nNo  no  no! No! No! No! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus If you wanna see how colossally\nAdam and I messed up  then good news: you can\nwatch the episode right now if you're a Nebula subscriber.

Even if you've seen the\nprevious four episodes  you might wanna stay for this recap \nbecause things are getting sticky. Right now  Adam and I \nthe Chasers  are pursuing Ben on his way\nto Borkum  Germany. We just got off the train to\nSaint-Quentin  where Ben currently is  one stop early\nin a town called Tergnier  because we thought he was\ngoing to leave Saint-Quentin  and go to Amiens \nwhere we could catch him. Unfortunately for us  Ben didn't\nget on the train to Amiens. He got on the train we were\njust on  heading to Maubeuge  a small town with\nvery few connections  where we can't possibly catch him. That means Adam and I have to\nfigure out where he's going next  and we think the answer\nis Brussels. We just have to hope that's\nwhere he ends up  and that we can get there\nbefore he manages to leave. That is so embarrassing. Oh my God  he got on\nthe train that we got off. Let's figure out our\nfastest route to Brussels. We want to go to Brussels  right?\nHe's going to Brussels. Okay  here we go. I just need to figure out\nwhere I go after this. And I... honestly have no idea. We have to go back to Paris? I think it thinks it's\nthe fastest route  yeah. Oh my god! Are we sure he's going north? (stammering) Yeah  he's well north of the station. Oh  Jesus! I think after I get to Maubeuge  my best bet is to go to Lille. And I know  I'm sorry  okay? I know we already went to Lille \nand this is a travel show  but here's the bright side  okay? I got a lot of coins burning\na hole in my pocket  and Lille is... ...a big hub  very busy hub. So I think I'll be able to just hop\non a train right when I get there. And we won't have to waste\ntoo much time there  which is also good  because that's... It's gonna be an easy place\nto intercept me  unless they're already\nwaiting for me there. Cut to them\nwaiting for me there... ...right now. What is the bad news? The train we need\nto Brussels is sold out. No... Yes. No  that can't be right. We're sure there's not\na bus we could get on? Nope. Could we fly there? Not from here. Like  if we went back to Paris \ncould we fly to Brussels? Weirdly  there are flights\nbetween Paris and Brussels. But  not— No more today.\nThey all leave in the morning. This is not good. This is really bad. Alright  welcome to Maubeuge. I have about an hour  a little over an hour actually \nbefore the train to Lille. So while I'm here  I might as well\ntry to do a challenge. And if I have to veto it \nit's not a big deal. Let's go ahead and\npull our next card  and find out what it is\nthat we're gonna be doing. Okay  go exactly one mile. I am standing still. I'm gonna spin around and\npoint in a direction at random  and then we are going to...\nlook at a map and figure out\nwhere that location is. So long story short \nthings are quite bad. We're in a bit of pickle. Right now  we think that\nwe want to get to Brussels  because it seems like Ben\nis headed to Brussels. Yeah. So I think that\nwhat we do is we go here to Amiens  we go Amiens to Lille \nand then we go Lille to Brussels  and we get there just before 7:00. It's not for an hour.\nSo we've unexpectedly earned ourselves some time in...\nWe're just gonna hang out. What's this place called?\nTournai? Yeah  oh no... Tergnier[tursen-yer]. Tergnier. Oh  I sure feel stupid\nright now. Okay. Okay. I'm dizzy. Okay. So this is the direction\nthat I'm pointing. It seems like it's\nright next to this school. It would take much more than\na half hour to walk there  so I couldn't walk there\nand back. There is a bus that would kind of\ntake me kind of close to there  but it would take like 20 minutes and\nthat bus only arrives in 20 minutes. So I'm just gonna go ahead \nI'm gonna veto this. We're just gonna chill. We don't even need the money. We can get out of Lille without\nthe money  so who cares? I'm gonna try and find\na place to hide. I see some woods over there  and I think I honestly\nmight just... ...crouch in the woods\nfor a little bit... ...until it's time for my train. Tergnier  more like... ...tree ne-ar. Tergnier  more like tree right there. Wait  you just made\nthat joke in the last cut. That joke is good enough\nto do two times? I was doing a— I was doing a\ndifferent version of it. I was riffing. If he has three hours of Brussels \nhe won't know he's safe. But if he has three hours\nof Brussels  he is screwed.\nHe's gonna rack up a lot of coins. Oh  sorry. We're screwed. Sorry.\nWe're screwed. Yeah  the good news is his route  he doesn't have a\nsuper fast route to Borkum. Yeah  actually getting to\nBorkum is still quite hard. It's tough. It's tough. He arguably has  I think in my opinion \nthe hardest location. Borkum  most people \nwe generally agreed that Borkum is the hardest location. Ben really wanted it seemingly though. Yeah  it is weird.\nYeah. I mean  he didn't explain\nwhy  of course  but he seemed excited\nby getting more of the full start. No idea why. Maybe he knows\nsomething we don't. Hello  it's Ben reporting\nfrom the woods. There are no updates\nfrom the woods. I'm just gonna hang out here\nfor a little bit... ...so that I'm safe. One thing that's really funny\nabout being a Runner... ...is that you have no idea\nwhere the Chasers are. So even though we can't get to\nwhere Ben is for hours  I have to assume\nthat he is acting as if we're right on his tail  'cause he\nhas to assume that we are. He's gotta be so paranoid. I think there's an owl over there. That's kind of fun. Kind of fun owl vibe here. It says he's by the water. Maybe has to wait in the water.\nYeah  it's a possibility. So it seems like he's\ndoing a challenge. (gasp) Oh! Oh. There was a big spider on me. I don't like it in the woods. This sucks. The train to Lille leaves\nat 2:13. I think that's probably\nwhat he's doing. Let's double-check\nwhen we get into Lille. So we'll get to Lille\nat 5:07. Yeah  he'll get to Lille\nat 3:25. So he'll be there way before us.\nYeah. Off to Lille  again. I think there's a\npretty good chance... ...that they're gonna\nambush me in Lille. But if they're not waiting\nthere to ambush me  then I just have to make sure that\nI minimize my time there as much as possible. Alright  that's our train. We have our platform? Those clouds. Those clouds look fake. We photoshopped those in. Yeah  this is actually all just\nvery advanced deepfake. You would not believe how much\nit cost to CGI all of this in. I mean  that's why we keep trying to\nget you to sign up for CuriosityStream. Off... ...to Lille. Oh yeah  he's definitely\nout of the station. Yep.\nYep. So he's definitely on\nthat train to Lille. Yeah  he's on the train to Lille.\nThat's good for us. Great. He was gonna get to\nBrussels at 4:00. He's not gonna get there\nuntil about 6:00. Okay. Good news. It would seem \nI didn't notice this before  but there is a train\nfrom Lille to Brussels that I can actually just barely afford \nthat leaves at... ...4:08  which is like... ...a little over half an hour\nafter I get it. Might have to just do\nsome evasive action for a half an hour \nwhile I'm at Lille. We're back in Lille.\nWe were here yesterday. We're back in Amiens. We're— We're not back\nin Lille yet. Sorry. Being a little confused.\nWe've been in a lot of places. Why did you take the stairs? Exercise. Okay  we've made it to Lille. I have about a half an hour \na little more than half an hour  before there's a train\nto Brussels. So all I have to do...\nis not get caught. I don't see Sam and Adam \nso that's good. Alright. Welcome to Amiens. We're here for about\n40 minutes. That's the famous Amiens [ah-miens]  Tower. It was built in 1948. It's the only tower in Europe\nbuilt by Francis Lloyd Wright. Just to be clear \nnone of that is true. Yeah  but it could be true. You don't know for sure.\nI'm sure that that's not true. I would imagine\nthat's probably false. I think I might be safe\nif I can make it into a decently big  complex building. What about this building? I mean  look.\nIt's for New Yorkers. Oh  there's a Lego store. I love Legos. This is a really well-stocked\nLego store. They got Star Destroyers. I gotta focus. I gotta focus. Not gonna buy Legos.\nNot gonna buy Legos. I'm just gonna go hide... ...by this bike equipment. Alright. Where's your friend\nand mine  Ben Doyle. Okay.\nHe's in Lille. Big question's gonna be \ndoes he only stay in Lille for a little bit or\ndoes he stay for a while? You get on the trains\nin two and a half hours. Okay. That train leaves\nin 15 minutes now  so I'm gonna start carefully making my way back\nto the train station. Hopefully... ...they're not waiting\nto catch me there. Look  Sam \nit's another ad for... ...Krypto... ...et les Super-Animaux [ani-mel-ey]  Critics hail it as «Hilarant». Okay. I'm exiting the mall. Literally  anytime I see a man in\na hat  I'm like  \"Oh  it's them.\" I almost had a heart attack earlier  'cause I heard someone\nrunning behind me  but it turns out it was a baby. Okay  the train is there. This is literally the same train station\nthat they caught me by getting on the train\nthat I was on. So  certainly getting on the train\ndoes not make me any safer. I still don't see them. They could get on the train\nany minute. Krypto et les Super-Animaux. You know what this is\nin English? Super-Pets  I believe. Right here.\nAlright. Platform's there. Some big boy. Ooh  it is a big boy. Look at that big  beautiful boy\nthat we're about to get on. It's got some girth. Okay  so it shows Ben\non the tracks. In fact  I think the same track\nhe was on yesterday  when we caught him there. Unfortunately  it does not look like\nwe'll be catching him there again. (train horn) Whoa. (whispering) The train\nis leaving the station. Go Ben. Go Ben.\nGo Ben. Go. So the good news is... Ben had... what  an hour and a half\nhead start on us? But he's taking\nslow  regional trains  and we're about to take\na high speed train. So we're gonna cut\nthat lead by about half. We're in Silly. Look  Sam  it's me! New Yorker.\nYou're from North Carolina. So Ben just got to Brussels-Midi \nwhich is where we're going. Looks like he's just outside. So yeah. I wonder\nwhat he's doing next. We'll see him soon. Okay. Welcome to Brussels. It is time to do a challenge  because I am almost\nout of budget  and Adam and Sam are\nprobably right behind me. So... let's go do a challenge. Let's go ahead and pull our card. Card we've got is... ...cursed. \"Roll a die.\nWhatever number you roll  \"you must take that number train on the departure board\nat your nearest station.\" Well  that is very interesting. Let's go ahead and\nroll a die  and we're gonna find out\nwhere we are headed next. That is a five. That means we are taking the\nfifth train on the departure board  so let's go find out\nwhere we're going. Okay. It looks like the fifth train\non the departure board is Namen/Luik-Guill. Okay. I finally found\nthis platform. This is the train. Only gonna go... ...one stop on this train. That's gonna take me to\nanother part of Brussels  which is actually good for me. So this card was awesome. I'm starting to get\na little worried about the timing of our impending tag  because it's 6:23. We're going to get into Brussels\nat about 6:50. I'm not sure I can get\nanywhere useful  if the tag happens at 7:20-ish \nbefore the rest period ends. That would mean that the whole\n45-minute grace period effectively becomes worthless. So yeah  this could get really awkward\nfor my next stint as Runner. Oh man  I'm thirsty. I had water earlier  but then\nthis French teen took it. He walked up to me and\nwas like  \"Can I have that?\" And I was like  \"I guess.\" I— He just took it. Let's pull a card.\nAnd the card is... Find a fancy car. So  okay. I have to find a car that is\nworth more than 100 000 Euro. But I know nothing about cars. I have to figure out where\nthe rich people would be. I've done a little bit of research\nand I had a very funny idea. There is a luxury car rental\nservice at the airport here. And I know that\nif I go to the airport  and they're looking at the tracker\nand I'm at the airport  they're gonna have a heart attack. 'Cause I think the airport's\nalso a pretty big train hub. I know we need to hurry.\nIs he going to enter or to leave? I'm at the airport. I'm gonna do an impression of\nAdam looking at his tracker. \"Oh— Oh my god.\nHe's at the airport?\" Something like that.\nI'm kinda off my game. I'm very tired. He's headed... Where's he going? Oh  he's at the airport! He's like at-at the airport. Let me look\nwhat that could be. Oh  this is it.\nHe's just trying to confuse us. I think. I doubt he's getting\na flight  right? He can't have the budget.\nNo  there's no way. Let's figure out our way.\nLet's go to the airport. We'll get the exact same\ntrain that he got. This car looks like\nit might be nice. Please don't make fun of me\nif this car is not nice. It's a C180... ...and it seems like\nit is not 100 000 euro. I'll keep looking. This is like a... This like an EV... ...SUV. That might be expensive. No  that car is even less money\nthan the other car. Track 15. Oh  go— Let's go—\nTwo  maybe three minutes. Okay. 15's... this way  this way. I know  I know. I'm working on it. No  you're kidding! That was it. Okay  taxi. Really? (anguished shout) Okay. Come on. Let's keep looking.\nLet's find a fancy car. This looks like a fancy car. Is this a fancy car? It says Porsche. That's a fancy brand of car. I know that much. Okay. After...\nafter excessive Googling... I have determined that\nthis car is a Porsche 911. That is probably not gonna come\nas a surprise to many of you who have been screaming\nthat at your screens  but I figured it out \nand it was very hard for me  so. This car starts at 100 000 dollars. Or 100 000 euros.\nSame thing now. Egh. I would say that I have\nclaimed the fancy car card. Yeah  yeah.\nThese are taxis. Okay. Well now\nI have to decide... ...what it is that\nI'm gonna do next. We're getting pretty close\nto the end of the day here. And I really can't get very far. I'm probably here in Brussels\nfor the night. Let's do another challenge. Let's spend the last\n50 minutes of our day doing a challenge\nand hoping that... ...Adam and Sam don't\nmanage to track me down. They're probably here by now \nso I should be very careful. Are they headed\nto the airport? Maybe. We're so close. We're three minutes away. Oh  come on. Stay there. Our next card is... Eat the national dish. We... are finally in Belgium. And the national dish is frites  which is very fun\nand should be very easy. And again  I'm very hungry. Let's go find ourselves\nsome frites. (indistinct) No  no. Merci  merci. It's showing him in\nthis far room  but there's multiple levels. He could be on any level.\nVery discreet. Okay  they could theoretically\nbe showing up here at the airport\nat any moment  but... I'm kind of juking 'em out \n'cause if they head towards the airport  I'm heading right back towards\nthe station that they probably arrived at  which is definitely\ngonna annoy them. I don't see him.\nI don't see him. Did he go up? Let's go up  let's go up. Did it still show him\nexactly here? It's also  we're getting near\nthe end of the day. I don't even know if I'm gonna\nhave time to have frites. But what I do know is that\nI'm probably gonna end my day right around that train station. Which is great because it has\na ton of trains in the morning  so I can get right out\nof Brussels right away. He's there  he's there. Ah! Pretty good. You had quite a day.\nI had quite a day. Big day for you.\nLong day. Just a couple of minutes and\nI would've been going right back to the train station that\nyou probably came from. We have 39 minutes left. Alright  that time's\nvery valuable to you. So do the—\nExchange the cards. Shuffling the cards. Sam.\nThank you. It is about to be 7:25. We will start chasing you\nat 6:10 tomorrow morning. Go.\nBye! That could not have\ngone better for me. I'll explain why in a second. Us starting the...\njail period right now  right before the rest period \nwhere it's gonna get split up  is actually really good for us  'cause it means that Sam\ncan't get out of Brussels. He can't get on a train\nmoving out of Brussels before the rest period starts. Probably not gonna get\nanother chance on my run. So what I need to do\nis I need to go for it. I need to go for (indistinct) I already checked the configuration\none morning  and it's really advantageous\nto me from here. So  first thing I'm gonna do \nI need more budget. Right now  I got 4 600 coins. I need more. I calculated it from Paris. I needed about 6 000\nto do a safe run. But now I'm in Brussels \nso I'm even further. So... I think I'm gonna do... ...the 250-coin powerup that\ndoubles the value of the challenge. It also doubles the value of\nthe veto period. I am screwed if\nI have to veto a card. Okay  so... top card. Please let this be good. This determines\nwhether or not I can go on. Oh no. Touch an animal\nthat's not a pet. So the animal must be\nmouse-sized or bigger. The animal must be alive. The animal may be\nin captivity  domesticated  but it may not be attempting\nto become a pet. Okay  so a bird  theoretically. I do wonder if there's\na sniffer dog. Because a sniffer dog is\ndefinitely not a pet. Also  I don't know if I\ncould touch a sniffer dog... ...because it would be\nin the hands of police. Like  my best bet\nmight be like a raccoon? So... The animal must be\nmouse-sized or bigger. The animal must be alive. Aren't humans animals? Like... Under any definition \nhumans are animals  right? Hey  guys. So you can't move\nright now  right? No. And you also can't tag me\nright now  right? No  we cannot move\nor tag you. Okay  good.\nGood clarification. So... I wanted to get\nyour opinion on a card. Touch an animal that's not a pet. Humans are animals  right? Humans are animals. God dammit!\nIt's probably our oversight. But you can't tag me\nright now. So you're saying\nyou want to touch us? Yeah. I don't want you to touch me. Yeah. I'm sensitive. I have (indistinct) Oh  whoa! Enjoy the 750 coins. Buy yourself something nice. 750? Or maybe like... He doubled it.\nHe doubled it. Okay.\nWe're in trouble. Straight from the horse's mouth. This is what I want  see? I wanna get on that train to Cologne tomorrow morning. I think there's a 6:03 \nfrom what I saw earlier. Yeah  see? Platform one. So I wanna be on platform one when we end this period. Right  so... Sam has 15 minutes\nbefore the rest period. Presumably he is going to\nleave this train station. It'd be pretty stupid\nfor him not to. I am actually on\nthe platform right now that I need to be on\ntomorrow morning. One. Platform one. I think I'm gonna get this. Yeah  I mean  I can get\nall the way to Switzerland  I think  before they can catch up. I think we're going to\nZermatt tomorrow. And... I think we're winning\nthis thing  honestly. Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Unfortunately  this season of Jet Lag\nis getting pretty close to done. But if you wanna get closer to the finish \nif you wanna get closer to the finale  you can watch the next episode \nepisode six  right now  on Nebula. And you'll also be\nsetting yourself up for the best viewing experience possible\nfor the rest of the season. That's because every single\nepisode of Jet Lag goes up one week earlier\nthan YouTube  on Nebula. And then this season \nwhat we're doing is we're actually gonna be\nreleasing an aftershow. This whole big  long special available\nexclusive to Nebula subscribers  where we show you some of the\nmoments that didn't make it into the cut  explain some of the\nbehind-the-scenes  answer some questions \nexplain some strategy. It really is just going to enhance your\nNebula Jet Lag viewing experience. And the reason why we give\nNebula subscribers early access and these exclusives is because the show truly could not\nexist financially without them. We know the numbers.\nWe know what we get from YouTube  and we know what we get\nfrom Nebula. Simply  we would not\nbreak even on YouTube alone. That's because we get paid\nwhen people sign up for Nebula  and paid when people\nwatch on Nebula. So  it's a great deal  and the reason so many\nof you have signed up  I think  is 'cause it's also a\nreally good deal for you. That's because if you go to\nour landing page at CuriosityStream  curiositystream.com/jetlag  you get access to CuriosityStream when you sign up for\nany of their subscriptions there  and CuriosityStream\nhas access to loads of really good documentaries\nand nonfiction shows by big names like Jane Goodall\nand David Attenborough. Then when you sign up on that page\nfor any of their subscriptions — monthly  annual  4K  anything — you get access to Nebula\nfor free  for as long as you stay\nsubscribed to CuriosityStream. So it's two streaming sites\nfor the cost of one  and actually it's a little less\nthan the cost of one  because also at that page \nyou get a discount. It's like $14.79\nfor the entire year at curiositystream.com/jetlag\nright now. So it's two streaming sites\nfor the cost of one  for the cost of\nactually less than a fancy burger or something. And it helps support the show\nthat hopefully you like.

        "transcript": "Welcome back to\n\"Tag Across Europe.\" The final day is just about to start \nwhich is great  because Adam and I\njust tagged Ben in Brussels  which means they're in the\nChaser Jail until 6:10 am tomorrow. And I  Sam  am the Runner. The good news is\nI'm feeling really confident about getting to my win location. So confident that at the end of\nthe last episode  I said: I think we're going to\nZermatt tomorrow. And I think we're winning\nthis thing  honestly. The bad news is... Well  you'll see. Okay  I just identified a problem. They could make this 6:13. Their pause period\nends at 6:10. And that could connect to the train\nthat I'm gonna take tomorrow morning. So I need to decide what\nI'm gonna do about that. Okay  it's 8 pm.\nThe rest period is starting. 8 pm. The rest period just started! We will see you back\nat this exact spot  at 6 am. So sleepy. The game has restarted. Okay.\nYaay. Through the power of\nYouTube magic  it is 6 am. Good morning.\nWe are back at it. And it is officially... 6 am. Let's go to it. Alright  so. We still have to stay here\nfor ten minutes. It appears that Sam is actually gonna\ntake the train directly behind us. It leaves at 6:03  and it\ngets him to what train station? Bruxelles-Midi. Yeah  so the biggest train station—\nOh  there he is. There he is. I have an important\nmessage for you. Okay. Let me make sure I'm recording. Okay  so at 6:10  that's when you\nget released  right? Yes.\nWrong. 'Cause I'm buying a\n2 000-coin powerup. You're staying here for\nanother 10 minutes. Nooo! God dammit!\nBye~! Now I'm getting on this train. We kinda thought\nhe might do that  but that... It's a worthwhile expenditure.\nIt's worthwhile expenditure for him. I'm sure that means that he can\nprobably get on a train to Brussels. Okay. It's just gonna be a question... of where the hell he\ngoes from here. Yeah. Just getting into\nBrussels-North station  in about 15 minutes before\nmy train to go Cologne  which is perfect. Not too tight of a connection \nbut tight enough. Ben  Adam  I checked \ndefinitely can't make it. So  train at 6:25 to Frankfurt. That would make\na lot of sense for him. Shoot  we can't get on a\ntrain there till 7. There's not— (sigh) The next one would get in\nat 11:30 to Frankfurt. So we would be behind him\nby two hours. He wouldn't even be winning\nat Frankfurt. It's 280— You would\nstill be winning. So he won't do—\nHe won't stay there. So he has—\nHe'd have to keep going. Just as a reminder  I don't need to\nget all the way to my location to win. I just need to be in this part of the map\nwhen the clock strikes 8. But if I  or whoever the Runner is\nat the end of the game  is in one of the other win locations\nwhen the time runs out  then Ben or Adam will win instead. He has to get out of Frankfurt\nif he wants to win. And that means he has to head\nstraight towards Strasbourg. How soon could we get\nto Strasbourg? There is a 7:17 train to Strasbourg. Straight to Strasbourg. Let's go to Bruxelles-Midi... with the intention of going\nto Strasbourg. Yeah.\nI think that is the best option. It's the only thing that\nputs us ahead of Sam. Okay. Great news.\nI see this train. It's here. It's on time.\nThat's fantastic. We're gonna move outta here.\nWe're going to Cologne. And Ben and Adam are not \nat least for two hours. The train that we wanna\ntake to Strasbourg  it says it's too soon\nbefore it leaves... To book a seat. Yeah  so we need to book... At the station.\nAt the station. Not ideal.\nNot ideal. Is he leaving? Yep  yep  yep. He's in the train.\nYeah  he is. Literally—\nWe're literally— I think he's literally on that train.\nHe's on this train. He literally is on this train. Man... (whispering) That close! So main thing now as I'm\ngoing to get to Cologne  I need to complete the\none-mile challenge quickly. I can't afford to get\nto Zermatt  so I think I need to\ntake a risk... buy another double powerup\nand pull another card. Go exactly one mile. Close your eyes  spin in a circle \nand point in a random direction. You must go as close as possible\non publicly-accessible land. This is good. This is good. And then just make sure\nI'm out of Cologne... within two hours \nwithin when they could get there. Where the hell do we go?\nTickets... It's a... It's a TGV. It says tickets right there. Don't run  or people think\nthere's a terrorist attack. Just fast-walk.\nFast-walk. ♪ Everything is okay ♪ Oh  is it here? We're trying to get tickets on\nthe 7:11 TGV to Strasbourg. (indistinct) Alright.\nSo we've just managed to get our tickets to Strasbourg.\nThat is  yeah. Let's make sure that we don't\nshow our personal information. Well  we'll blur it.\nWe got our tickets to Strasbourg. I'm feeling amazing that\nwe managed to pull that off. I did not think we were gonna\nbe able to get tickets. So we're gonna be\nright ahead of Sam. Yeah  so we are gonna be\nway ahead of him. This is really good. 717... track five. I've been doing research \nand the news is less than ideal. So basically here's the situation. So  turns out\nthat Ben and Adam actually still have\na pretty good route. So they could have made this train from Brussels Airport\nto Brussels-South station  and then made this TGV\nto Strasbourg. It goes nonstop\nall the way to Strasbourg  which puts them basically\nright within spitting distance of where I want to be. 'Cause I need to go\neither through Basel or Zürich. Yeah. Our train to Strasbourg\nis leaving. Three and a half hours. ♪ That means it's bedtime ♪ Oh  I'm excited to take a nap. 'Cause there's basically\nnothing we can do. Yeah. Even if it turns out\nSam is doing something different\nthan what we thought... Strasbourg would still be\nthe place to go. Because  what are we gonna do?\nGet off in Paris? That's just gonna be worse.\nYeah. Alright. We're arriving in Cologne.\nI got two hours to get outta here. Alright  I found a spot\nto hide while I do the incredibly awkward thing of\nspinning around with my eyes closed. Well  here we go. Oof. Okay. This way. Let me figure out\nwhich way that way is. So it looks like Sam has\nleft the station in Cologne. Yep. So it seems like\nhe's doing a challenge. I'm assuming he's still\ngonna go to Frankfurt  but... Yeah  I was looking. It seems like he can still\nreally only go in that direction  and it's where we're headed. Yep. So... See you soon  Sam. Okay  seemingly \nI am headed to here  Fontanestraße[phone tah neh straw bay]. Let me get directions to there. On the move. On the— Wait.\nI'm supposed to go this way. Wait  am I? Okay  the good news is this seems\nto be on a metro line or something. Or some sort of transit line \nso it's probably gonna be pretty efficient to get back here\nif we need to in a rush. Alright  we're getting into the\nresidential area where that spot is. You just have one left turn and right there. That was easy. Well  if you ever wanted\nto know what was exactly one mile north of\nKöln Hauptbahnhof  It's this delightful little\nresidential street. Alright  I'm going to figure out\nwhat to do next now. If the number of people getting\non the train is any indication  I think we just... Just barely.\nbarely made it onto this thing. All of these people.\nIt's like completely full now. We're in Lille\nfor the third time. Man  who knew we were\ngonna go to Lille so much? I love Lille city. It's a great spot. Alright  I have 40 minutes\nto the next train to Frankfurt  and there's another one\n47 minutes after that  so I have some time to plan. I'm thinking the\nright move now is to... do another double-up powerup\nand pull another card. I have a pretty... I'm pretty certain I'm safe\nfor at least another hour  so I might as well just do\nthe double-up powerup. Alright  I'm gonna lock it in. I'm gonna buy the double-up\npowerup again for a third time. On that note \nI'm gonna pull a card. Eat the national dessert. Germany: Berliner. Okay  I have enough time \nbut not copious time  before those two back-to-back\ntrains to Frankfurt  and I should have a few minutes\nto look for a Berliner. And if not  I'll look in Frankfurt. I've gotta hurry. It doesn't show a platform number. \"Zug fällt aus.\"\nWhat does that mean? No-o-o-o... Sam probably wants to get out\nof Cologne within two hours  'cause we could have gotten there\ntwo hours after him. Yeah  the train to\nCologne from Brussels  the one that we could've made \nleft exactly two hours later. So  he's gonna know that  and he's not gonna stay there\nany longer than that. I wouldn't imagine\nthat he would.  That is tremendously bad  because\nI already bought that train  and once we buy a train \nour coins are gone. I just lost almost\n1 600 coins on that. Looks like there's a slightly\nfaster itinerary to Frankfurt. If I... If I go back to the main\nHauptbahnhof  there's a train from\nhere to there in seven minutes. So I think that's the best\nthing to do right now. I messed up. I'm frazzled. I do not have the money to\ntake the train to Frankfurt now. That means I need to \nsomewhere in... I'm not gonna make\nthat one I was aiming for  but somewhere in\nKöln Hauptbahnhof  I need to find a Berliner. That will earn me—\nIt will earn me 1 800 points. It'll earn me enough to get to\nFrankfurt  but not much further. And oh man  this sucks. Surely Dunkin' has one  right? None of them are called Berliners.\nThey're just doughnuts. All these places  they're just\ncalling them doughnuts. Okay  so he was at\na train station  and then he took a train\nto another train station. We assumed he was leaving the city. But now he's taken a train back\nto the first train station. Be more predictable  Sam. Okay  bingo. This place has reviews saying \n\"Don't miss their famous Berliner.\" And it's like right here. Ye-e-e-e-es! Hi. Can I have a Berliner? Oh  very nice. Oh yeah. They could be getting\nhere in ten minutes. I need to figure out a train\nonce I can finish this donut. Once I finish this donut \nI think I'll get... 1 800  right? Yeah. There's a train to Frankfurt\nat 10:18. I think we gotta do that. Let's go for it. We're gonna be in Strasbourg\nin about an hour and a half. Do we wanna stay there  or do we wanna try to\nintercept him in Frankfurt? We'll just have to see where he is.\nLet's see where he is. I mean  our move's feeling\nbetter and better to me. Fingers crossed. It's canceled! This one's canceled too. Luckily I didn't book this time. Okay  looks like there's\nanother train to Frankfurt  at least to Frankfurt Airport... in about 30 minutes. Hopefully it's not canceled. I'm gonna aim for that and\nthen draw another card. See if I can complete\nanother challenge. I don't think I'm gonna\ndouble up this time. I... Yeah  'cause I really wanna\nget on this train and get out of... here. Alright  here's the deck. Alert the Chasers as soon\nas you pull this card. Choose a building within\ntwo miles where you are now. Send the Chasers its address \nturn off your tracker  and then find... Awesome. I don't think they're\nanywhere near here. We're in Champagne. [sham pahn ya] Did you know that it doesn't count\nas the region of Champagne  unless you're in\nChampagne  France? Good bit  Adam.\n(both giggling) As long as we have\na really big building. Honestly  it might be this one. So it looked like on the satellite view \nthere's a rooftop parking garage. I feel like that's a relatively\nunintuitive place  so I'm gonna try that. Alright. Here is the rooftop. Oh  wow. There's not a single car here. Okay. I'm gonna hang out here\nfor an hour. It's got some nice shade. It's got some shelter. I don't think they're here\nanyways  and I don't think that this would be\nthe first place they would look. I bet they would\nsearch the store first. So assuming Ben and Adam\nare doing what I think they are  which sure seems like they are. They should be getting into Strasbourg\nexactly in two minutes. So I'm gonna look  if they're in Strasbourg \nwhat would they probably do next? I think it's very possible\nthat Ben and Adam predict that I'm gonna go to Frankfurt next. Which to be fair \nI likely am  although maybe not \nin this case. But given that  it seems like the earliest\nthey could get to Frankfurt is 3:08 pm from Strasbourg \nso I'm gonna keep that in mind. We are here in Offenburg. We took a taxi a half hour\nfrom Strasbourg  across an international border  because it turns out we can\nget to Frankfurt a whole lot faster if we drive here and then take\na train from Offenburg. We'll be there around two \nI think  right? (slow-mo voice)\nEarliest they could get to Frankfurt is 3:08 PM. But yeah  we're\nabout to board a train to... What's the place called?\nIt has a fun name. Baden-Baden.\nBaden-Baden. And then we're gonna go\nBaden-Baden to Frankfurt. Okay  so the main problem\nnow is that basically all the trains between\nwhere I am and Switzerland go on this main stretch\nbetween Frankfurt and Basel. And they're  I think \nin Strasbourg right now. So they can go up and down\nthis line pretty easily. So I need to find a way to either\nget vaguely towards where I'm going  not on this line \nor a way to jump over them. The reason we're going to Frankfurt\nis because there are a number of things that Sam\ncould do after he leaves Cologne. He could go on a really long\nhigh-speed train down to Basel  but we could intercept him in Frankfurt \njust like we could intercept him here. He might be just going\nto Frankfurt to do challenges  in which case obviously \nwe could get him in Frankfurt  or he could be going east... to... I don't know. Nuremberg or something.\nAnywhere in Germany. And in that case  he would\neither go through Frankfurt  and we could try to get him \nor if he goes there  being in Frankfurt's gonna be\na lot better than being here. So this is our most\nflexible option probably. Yeah. It's really annoying\nthat we came all the way here  'cause we could have been\nin Frankfurt like... now. Actually a little before now. But we thought Sam\nwas gonna be smarter... We overestimated him.\nthan he is being. We won't make that mistake again.\nNo. Okay  so to be honest \nI don't think that this game is gonna end with me getting to\nGornergrat Observatory in Zermatt. There's just not enough\ntime left today. And I don't have enough\nbudget right now. I'd need to do more challenges. What I need to be focused on\nis the second win condition. Okay  I think I have a plan. There's a 12:18 train\nto Frankfurt. Then there's a relatively\nquick transfer to Stuttgart. The advantage of Stuttgart is\nit gets me out of the corridor that they're gonna be going up. If my timing is right\nand my guess is right that they're gonna head north\nto Frankfurt to try to cut me off  then I should be able\nto get to Stuttgart  and especially get to the\nintermediate station  Mannheim  before they can \nand so I'll jump them. And hopefully they'll be\nstill headed north. From Stuttgart  there are\ntrains south to Zürich. They're long  but\nthey're slow-speed trains  so they cost less. Alright  it is 11:50  and as you can see \nno Ben or Adam. So... let's go to... first Frankfurt  and then\nI think next Stuttgart. The train's here. Yaay. Off to Baden-Baden. Please  please \nlet's go to Baden-Baden. Okay  turns out there's a delayed\ndirect train to Stuttgart. Google says the train  the station\nis twelve minutes away. I think I can make it in six. I think I can do it. Wait  this is just Baden. Look. We need to get to Baden-Baden.\nThis is... We need one more Baden. Our train leaves in seven minutes \nand we're not there yet. Okay. Five minutes.\nStation's in sight. I think our train literally\nleaves in one minute. It's on platform four. Wait  wait. Platform six  I think. Wait  god dammit.\nWhere's our train? That's platform four. That's our train leaving. Made it. We can still get to Karlsruhe. Ah  this is not... ...great.\nThis is not what we wanted. That was the wrong one. I don't know how I got\nplatform six. That was to Munich. I want platform four. Okay. It was the platform six one. I don't know. I was confused. He said Munich. I just missed it. (train horn) It's literally that one. Okay  that's not a massive deal. It just loses me 20 minutes. That's fine. Okay  well our train into Baden-Baden\ngot in a couple minutes late. Just long enough for us to\nmiss the train to Frankfurt. So we're staying on this train. It's gonna go all the way\nto Karlsruhe. Or maybe we just hope\nhe comes down to Karlsruhe. Most of the trains down\nwould stop there. It looks like he just left\nfor Frankfurt  so... I don't know. I don't\ntotally know what to do. Okay  so we missed\nour train to Frankfurt  but we managed to get one\nto Mannheim  which we're about to\nget on now. Sam appears to be\non his way to Frankfurt. If he goes south at all  he will have to go through\nMannheim  almost certain. And we will know\nwhat train he's on. We can just get\non that train and then Exactly. Exactly.\nhe's trapped on that train with us. Alright  welcome to\nFrankfurt Airport station. So hopefully right around now \nBen and Adam are desperately panicking over\nwhere I could possibly go next. And hopefully they're\nnot concluding Stuttgart  'Cause honestly  that doesn't really\nmake sense to get to Zermatt. But right now I'm not really\nfocusing on getting Zermatt. I'm just focusing on\ngetting safely south. Okay. Okay. Alright.\nWe are here in Mannheim. We're almost certain that Sam\nis gonna have to come to Mannheim. He's in Frankfurt now. Frankfurt is still in the\nregion where Ben would win. Sam has to go south. I guess he could technically\ngo really far east  but like... it's so easy\nfor him to get here. If he wants to go to Zermatt \nhe has to come here. So we're just gonna wait  figure out what train he's on \nif it starts to come here. And then once it stops here \nwe're just gonna get on it. And then we'll tag him. And if it doesn't come here... There's no way!\nIt has to come here. Ehh  we'll figure it out.\nWe'll figure it out. So this only stops in\nMannheim. That's the only risk. But it seems that the earliest\nthey could get there from when they would've gotten\nfrom Strasbourg would've been 2:24. And this will go through at 2:04.\nSo it should just miss them. Assuming that works. While we wait for Sam to\nfall into our little trap  we've gotten some food. Ben and I both got waters. Mine is the daddy water. I got a little baby water.\nAnd Ben's is the baby water. I'm already carrying\nway too much weight. I can't carry this thing. Okay  I think that he got on a train\nto Mannheim just recently. We just have to\nfigure out which one— Okay  I think we found\nwhat he was on. We think that he got on\na 1:33 train to Stuttgart [stew gurt] that\ngoes through Mannheim. We just need\nto figure out where— We can look at the arrivals. Yeah  yeah. Okay  okay.\nWe gotta hurry. We gotta hurry. Yeah  he gets in at 2:05. We just have to figure out\nwhat platform he is. Platform five. Okay  it's gonna be here\nin about 15 minutes. I got way too close\nto your face on this one. Okay  so I've just realized... that if I'm not able to tag Sam and then get off the train\nbefore it leaves  I'm gonna be on the train with them\nduring almost their entire jail period. Now you might say  \"Why don't you get\non the train and wait to tag him?\" But I want Adam\nto be subjected to that train. That'll be— 'Cause then we tag him\nright away and then it's my turn  and we're still in my zone \nand I win. We need to make sure\nhe doesn't see us  'cause if he sees us get on \nhe'll get off. Yeah.\nAnd then we'll leave on the train. I don't think he's gonna\nsuspect us here. No  I don't think so either.\nBut we need to hide. Yeah. We're gonna split up to\ndifferent sides of the platform  so we can close in\non him like that. Okay. I think this is the train. It's a long train. I got a lot of cars to look through. Okay. Gonna move to the front. Okay. I'm looking. We're sure he didn't get off? I didn't see him. I didn't see him get off. Okay. He's at the front—\nHe's at the back of the train. I can tell by where he is\nat the platform. Okay. Unless he got off. But it doesn't look like\nhe's moving at all. Sorry. I still don't see him. Oh  sir. Are you having tags?\nYou're it. I got him. Oh  oh  I'm meant to\nget off the train. Get off the train. Get off the train.\nGet off the train. Get off the train. No  shoot! Oh  no... Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus Trapped on a train  and with\njust five hours left in the game  does Adam have any shot\nof getting out of my zone? Or is the Runner gonna go to Ben  and will he beeline north to Borkum\nto get out a last shot at victory? Or is the game mine \nare we too deep in my zone with too little time left\nfor them to get out? All of these questions will be\nanswered one week from today  on the Jet Lag season finale.

        "transcript": "Hello and welcome to the\nfinale of \"Tag Across Europe\". Just as a refresher \nbecause this is gonna happen this episode \none way or another  there are two ways\nto win this game. The Runner can reach\ntheir end location  or at the end of 72 hours \nthe win goes to whoever's location is closest\nto the final Runner  which you can see in\nthese win areas. Simply put  whoever's win area\nthe current Runner is in when the clock hits 8 pm\nwill be declared the winner. Right now  there are five and\na half hours left in the game. All three of us are in\nMannheim  Germany  which is in my win area. But at the end of last episode \nI got caught on my train to Stuttgart  and Adam became the\nnext Runner. That means we're all trapped on\nthis train for the next half hour  headed even further\ninto my win area. Once the train arrives\nin Stuttgart  Adam will have ten minutes\nto find a way out of Stuttgart  before Ben and I\ncan start chasing him. And then he has to get all the way\nto his slice of the map by the end of the day \nif he wants to win. Get off the train. Get off the train.\nGet off the train. Get off the train. No  shoot! Oh no. Adam's on the train. Adam is on the train. He just didn't want us\nto tag you right at the very moment that\nthe train started moving  which is Smart.\nExactly what happened. Oh no. He tagged him at the exact\nmoment the train started moving. So  where'd you go? Strasbourg? Yeah  we went to Strasbourg. Adam  come on over\nto the cafe car. Yeah  I'm working on it. You got here faster than\nI thought you could. No  you know what? The reason we were able\nto get here faster is 'cause we took a car to\nAustin-berg. [sic] That explains it.\nI knew there was a potential. Well  I thought actually\nthat there wasn't. So I didn't think about a car. I still think I'm—\nI'm still feeling pretty good. I still feel that... we are not near Jersey. No  we are not\nanywhere close to Jersey. Yeah. Adam is gonna have a long\nrun ahead  that's for sure. Yep. And Adam  you better hurry up. Alright  well  we're doing a\nhigh-speed handoff here. And then Adam is gonna have to—\nI don't really want the cards. You have to take them. The cards are yours now. I don't want them. Are they shuffled?\nDid you shuffle them? You have to shuffle.\nShuffle them. I'm not taking them until\nthey're properly shuffled. This sucks a lot. I will turn on my tracker. Alright  ready for the\nhigh-speed handoff? Adam  you ready? Okay. It's 2:20. In a few seconds—\nIt was 2:20 and six seconds  and I want that to be accounted for.\nOkay. 2:20 and six seconds. 2:20 and six seconds.\n2:20 and six seconds. Okay  so you can start\nchasing me at 3:05. And six seconds.\nAnd six seconds. Okay  great.\nGood luck  Adam. And I'm feeling pretty good\nabout my chances. I'm feeling very good\nabout my chances. I'm feeling really good...\nabout my odds. We take a seat and... Let's go sit down\nand begin our jail period. Okay. Now I just have to desperately\nhope against hope that there's a good train\nout of Stuttgart. I know that there are trains\nto Paris from Stuttgart  but I don't know when they leave. Okay  let's take a look. Well  Sam  we have to figure out\nwhere Adam might be going. I don't think he'll go very far. The train is getting in\na few minutes late  so I'm gonna have even less time. Okay  really bad news. The train got in seven minutes late. I gotta go to Karlsruhe\nin six minutes. So we have to stay on this\nplatform for 16 minutes. Welcome to Stuttgart  by the way.\nWelcome to Stuttgart. It's— Well  I would say\nit's beautiful  but I can't tell. I'm sure it's beautiful.\nThere's a train in the way. Adam is probably running around the\nstation trying to catch a train. 2:59. Is it delayed? No. Wrong one. I need the other one.\nIt leaves in four minutes. And the problem is that\nexactly right now  there's a train that leaves for Paris\nfour minutes after this got in. So the question is just gonna be \ncan he get on that train and can he get\nall the way to Paris? Because it's gonna be hard for him to\nafford that three-hour high-speed train. Three hour and 12 minute high-speed train.\nHe would have to have a ton of budget. And the last stop before Paris\nis not very far from here. It's Strasbourg  so... Where you all just came from \nso that wouldn't get him that much. Alright. So I'm on the train to Karlsruhe. This actually is the train\nthat goes to Paris  but if you go past Karlsruhe \nseemingly  you have to have a reservation. I wonder if I can talk to somebody. Excuse me. Hi  I have a ticket to Karlsruhe. Can I buy a reservation to stay\nuntil Strasbourg on the train? The problem is I can do\nnothing  and I'm alone. Okay. Maybe you can look on\nthe site of the SNCF. The SNCF site. Okay.\nI'm on the Eurail side. Okay  I'll try on SNCF.\nYeah. Okay. Oh! I can do it on the\nSNCF website. Okay. Okay. There we go. Has Adam left the station? He has not. Oh  yep  he's gone. Okay  so let's look at how\nto get to Strasbourg. Strasbourg.\nThat's the way  Strasbourg. So this doesn't look ideal. Okay  Ben. Good news. There is a quicker train to Karlsruhe.\nWhen does it leave? It leaves at 3:09  but it says\nit's delayed by two minutes. And it's gonna be on\nplatform eight. So we're on— What are we on? We're on— Platform eight's right there.\nOh  yeah. So we just have to go\none platform over  and we'll have between\nthree and five minutes. That's choice!\nYay. Alright  let's book this train\nto Karlsruhe. Okay. It is 3:05 and six seconds. Here we go. We're off. I don't even know if we can run. Dramatic tension  even though\nwe have almost five minutes. This is good content. My card isn't working.\nIt's been a problem. I'm trying to call someone. Hey  hey  this is an emergency. My debit card isn't working. Can I use your debit card?\nDo you have a Visa or a MasterCard? I have six minutes. 2-5-8... Made it.\nSo we're right behind Adam. Adam is on his way to Karlsruhe. We don't know if\nhe's gonna get off there. Yeah. But if he does \nwe'll be on his tail. Okay  and what's the security code? Okay. Please  please  please work. Please  please  please  please \nplease  please  please  please  please. Okay. Adam is just outside\nof Karlsruhe now  so. We'll probably get a scent in the\nnext few minutes whether or not he's continuing on to\nStrasbourg or stopping there. Okay. Incredible news. I have my ticket to Strasbourg. I can stay on this train. Ooh. Oh  hi. Ticket  yes. You have him?\nI have an update. It would appear in that Adam\nhas continued from Karlsruhe. Oh no!\nWhich means that he's not immediately toast. Okay. So I think we're going\nto Strasbourg. There's a 4:07 train from\nKarlsruhe to Appenweier. And from Appenweier \nthere is a... There's a relatively quick\nconnection to Strasbourg that would get us in at 5:36. And what— Do we know what time\nAdam's getting into Strasbourg? I am gonna arrive\nin Strasbourg at 4:15. They will arrive in Strasbourg\nat 5:36. So I have about\nan hour  15 minutes  a little more  to probably do\na challenge and get on a train. Which is pretty good. Okay  so we are almost\nin Karlsruhe. and it turns out\nwe can get on a train almost immediately to Offenburg. So we need to book it\nonce we get here  to make sure that\nwe can get on that. And then once we get to Offenburg \nit's a five minute connection. So we'll need to book it now.\n(announcing in German) Okay. Let's go.\nSo close. Okay. You didn't see a problem  correct? No. We just gotta run through and look\nat the screens on the platforms. Is it up there? No  this is a [indistinct] line. No. I don't think this train exists. I went to every platform\nand I don't see an ICE. No. Maybe it was canceled\nor something. Okay  so I got so\nstressed doing research that I didn't have time to explain\nmuch while I was on the train. So I'm doing it in VO. I already got pretty lucky\nmanaging to get to Strasbourg  but I'm still 173 miles away\nfrom my win area  with less than four hours\nleft in the game. To make matters worse \nI only have about 70 minutes until the chasers arrive in Strasbourg \nand just 1 725 coins. So  what are my options? Well  there's a train to Nancy\nat 5:19 that I could afford now  but I'd still be\na hundred miles short. And it's slow-speed \nso it gets in at 7:00  and there aren't any trains I could take\nfrom there to my win area before the game ends at 8:00.\nIt doesn't work. There's a train to Meuse\nat 5:31. It gets me closer \nbut I'd still be 55 miles short  and again  no trains from there\nget me to my win area in time. It's not an option. Getting to Paris would take\n2 900 coins  more than I could probably earn. Things aren't looking good. I basically need a miracle \nbut then I find one. The train to Paris has\nexactly one stop at a station called\nChampagne-Ardennne  which it turns out  is exactly\nthree miles within my win area. It's my only possible way to win. The only problem is...\nI'm short by 330 coins. Alright. I'm here in Strasbourg. I'm here. My train got in late.\nIt's 4:20. They're gonna be here at 5:36. There is a train at 5:17 that I really need to take to\nChampagne-Ardennes. It is just  just  just  just\nbarely in the area where I win. But I'm 330 coins short  so... Okay  I'm gonna draw a card. I just need it to be an easy card. Please  please  please \nplease  please. Here we go. Top card. What is it? Get 1 000 feet from\nany building. Oh no. Oh no. I don't know\nif that's possible here. Oh no. I don't know\nif that's possible here. Okay  I might veto this! Ah  shoot! Okay  I'm gonna take a look\nat if this is possible. Ben  there's apparently\na direct bus leaving at 4:15 directly to Strasbourg from here. From here?\nFrom here. And Adam will never\nsuspect that bus. Yeah  let's hop on that\n4:15 bus and get directly to\nwhere he is going. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This isn't very good. Okay  there's a bunch of fields \nbut they're 25 minutes away. I don't think I could get there. There's a lake. What if I got into\nthe middle of the lake? Can I swim that far? No. I don't think\nI could swim that fast.  Or  I also might die. (tense moan) No. Okay. I'm vetoing.\nI'm vetoing. I'm vetoing. I can pull another card\nat 4:55. (groan) Okay. Oh  shoot! Just gotta hope this is on time. (distant brassy music) That's delightful. Yeah. Little ambience\nfor the end of the series. Can we legally play this? I don't know. Unless that guy comes for us. Okay  we found the bus. So we're making a beeline\nfor Strasbourg. Okay  while I'm safe here\nduring my veto period... I'm gonna just walk to the\noutside of the train station  more towards where\nthe town would be  in the hopes that when\nI pull my next card  if it's doable  that I can\ndo it in not that long. This is gonna be a\nreally long 30 minutes. Okay  let's see.\nAdam  what are you up to? He's outside the station. You just hanging out? Guess he's trying to do\na challenge right there. Trying to get back on a train \nwhich makes sense. Where could you be going?\nWhat could you be doing? You haven't gone far. I'm gonna need to get really lucky. Like  really lucky. Oh... 'Get away from a building'. I just  I can't  you can't\ndo that in an hour. Not here. So that train  the TGV to Paris  it actually stops in\nChampagne-Ardenne. So he could save on budget \nor go for less  by just taking it to there. So it could come down\nto three miles. But here's the deal. If he does do that  we have a 6:17 train to\nChampagne-Ardenne  so we could catch up to him. Imagine if it's a 33-minute... attempt to tag him before the end\nto decide the game. Whew. That would be something. Ten more minutes of veto jail. Just hoping for the best. Absolutely panicking. Just a dead panic. Okay  so we just realized that we\ncan actually take a train from Kehl and get into the station like... Slightly.\na little quicker. It leaves in under ten minutes. Oh god  okay. Where is the train station?\nIs this it? Yeah  I think this is it.\nOkay. Alright  we're coming\nfor you  Adam. Okay. Here we go. Hide your phone. You must place your personal phone\ndown in a publicly accessible location. It does not need to be visible. Travel at least 0.25 miles\naway from your phone before you turn to retrieve it. If the phone is stolen—\nOkay. I think I can do that. I'm putting my phone\nin these garbage cans. Okay. 0.25 miles. Alright. I need to see how\nfar away 0.25 miles is. Okay. Measure distance. I just need to go down\nthis street til I get to the... just before the\nMusée d'art moderne. Phone stashed in garbage can. Let's go. You just staring\nright at the camera? This isn't tense at all. I don't know how to look tense. This is the big climax\nof the whole show! There's no train. I'm stressed. Okay. That sign indicates that... this is the Musée. This is it. It says  «Entrée du musée». So  yeah  head back. I'm very tired. Train  where's the train? Train's supposed to be here. Well  we're still technically\nin Germany  so. Yes. I don't know. Germany trains today \nthey're not cooperating. One last... F U to us from Germany. Trash can. Oh god.\nPlease still be there. Ha-ha! Alright. Okay  I gotta book that train. I think I can make it. Alright  this is where\nI got messed up before. It's checking with the bank. Please go through. Come on. Then it goes back to here. Then it does this again. Please. It's money. Verify. Continue. Come on. Please work. Please work.\nPlease work. Please work. Please work. Please work. Please work. Please work. Please work. Please work. Please work. Yes! I got it! I got the ticket. Yes! There it is. Oh... Ben... it is not looking good. Oh. (sigh) That circle moved fast. Alright  well it looks like Adam\ndid make it outta Strasbourg. Question is  did he get out\non the TGV or on another one? Finally our train's here. If the train stops in Saverne... he's on the train to Nancy. If it doesn't... Then he's on the train to Paris. He's on the train to Paris \nand we're donezo. (heavy sigh) Okay  he's still on the move. He's just nearing the town\nthat would be the first stop on the train to Nancy. If he passes that town\nwithout stopping  then... he's headed to either Paris\nor Champagne-Ardenne. He's on the TGV  and... He's gonna make it? Well  either way \nI'm toast  so... Pour one out for me\nback at home. Oh  no.\nYeah. Oh  oh  no  no.\nNot to that. That's so sincere.\nThank you. He— No  no. Genuinely he passed it. He— He— Haha. Sam loses too.\nSam loses too. Well there's the 6:17 train that gets us to the same stop\nbefore the rest period. We gotta give it a shot. We do gotta give it a shot.\n6:17  you said? I think so. I mean  the chances are low \nbut they're not nothing. We gotta give it a shot. Alright. We have made it... to Champagne-Ardenne. This spot right here is\n285 miles from Zermatt. 281 miles from Jersey. We have specific locations\nin each place  an observatory in Zermatt \nand a lighthouse in Jersey  that were the specific spots\nthat we measured from. I don't know when they\ncould get here. I don't think they could\nget here that soon  but I don't know for sure. Adam is nearly to\nChampagne-Ardenne station. If he goes through to Paris \nwhen you have the budget to go all the way to Paris \nwe're done. We don't get to Paris\nuntil after eight. Game over. Adam wins. GG. If he stops there \nwe're gonna get there at 7:25. So we've a chance\nof tagging him  and literally  here's the thing. Just one mile east of the station  one mile bit east of the station \nit goes to me. But it's Ben's turn.\nSo Ben gets to decide who wins. Ben  I might maybe drop some\neuros on the way up the stairs. Oh  I will be accepting bribes\nfrom either party. Really?\nOh  yes. Oh yes. Yeah  okay.\nIt just moved. I think he's definitely going\noff the Bezannes bridge. We're still in business. Oh  we're coming for you Adam. We have 35 minutes\non the ground to tag him in Champagne. We've gotta do it. Yep  we've gotta do it. See you there. Okay  so there aren't any\nuseful trains for like an hour  and I'm too worried\nthey'd be able to get here. So the plan is I'm just\ngonna walk due west. and think if I get pretty far \nthen even if I do get caught  then the Runner would\nalso have to walk  'cause they wouldn't be\nable to take a car. And it's not possible that\nthey would be able to get into a territory where I don't win. Okay  good news. I thought that\nthis said no trespassing. But  «Défense de déposer des ordures\net encombrants sous peine d'amende» just means  \"Prohibition to deposit rubbish\nand bulky items under penalty of fine.\" I will not deposit any\nrubbish or bulky items! (imitates guitar strumming) ♪ (hums \"Eye of the Tiger\" riff) I'm gonna win. (scats) Right. We're basically here. It's not figuring—\nJust gotta get to Adam. It looks like he's just walking\nthrough the countryside. Away  like  west. Which  I mean \nthat's what I would do. I mean  yeah.\nChrist. What's gonna be the fastest\nway to get us a taxi? He's somewhere out there. Oh my god. I mean  is that not the\ncontent that you crave? That is the French countryside \nfor sure. It really would've been smart\nto refill my water bottle before I started doing this! Every car I see  I wonder if it's\na taxi that Sam and Ben are in. I don't think they could have\ngotten here by now  though. I also think that they would\nhave a lot of trouble communicating to a taxi where to go\nto come and get me. Surely Ben and Sam\nhave figured out what I'm doing at this point  right? 'Cause they can see me on the tracker\nso they can see that I'm just... in the middle of a field \nnowhere. I wonder what they're saying. That's Adam. I still think we're gonna get him. It's not gonna be very easy\nto sneak up over there though. Nope. ♪ This ship we sail is a kayak ♪ ♪ It's a kayak\nthat we rented here ♪ ♪ We love to sail our lovely— ♪ Whatever really stupid bits\nmade it into the edit... There's like fifteen... even worse bits that you\naren't even gonna get to see. Is that them? Oh man.\nI think that might be them. Why else would a taxi stop\nin the middle of that road? (speaking French) Merci. Are you just going?\nAre you just going for him? I'm hiding. 'Cause he's gonna run away. Okay. I'm jogging. Yeah  that's definitely them.\nThey're coming after me. Oh (bleep)! Oh (bleep)  they're\nback in the taxi! (bleep) Tag! Ohh. Okay. Let's go to Ben. That taxi driver came in clutch. He didn't understand\nwhat I was trying to explain. I can't believe you\ngot him to come here. Oh yeah  he was a\nlittle confused. Alright  that's yours. Well  gentlemen  I don't even have time to get to\nthe point where Sam would win. Don't say that I do \nbecause I don't. I believe in you. I don't.\nI believe in you! But I do have time to do\none last challenge with both of you. Wow.\nLet's do it. Get on a train immediately. Go. You have ten minutes.\nYou have ten minutes. Good luck. That taxi could come back. You can't take a taxi. I'm off  gentlemen. Bye  Ben!\nGoodbye! I don't think I can make it! I believe in you! Make sure you're filming yourself. I see that why they named it\nafter such a pretty beverage. Rhiems. Champagne. We could... We could go get our\ndog trained while we're at it. Well  since this jail period\nwill never end  we're allowed to wander.\nWanna just go walk with Ben? That makes a point.\nWe can wander as much as we want. That's a point  yeah.\nLet's go up to Ben. 'Cause we are allowed to\nmove during jail periods  as long as we resume\nat the same spot. Yeah  but we won't ever resume. So I say we go catch up to Ben. We finish this thing out together! He's all alone out there! Well  folks... that's wrap on season three. Thank you for watching. All the support has been\nreally overwhelming. Hey  buddy! We're coming to hang out! Keep going  Ben \nand you can make the train! I believe in you! This isn't a tag  it's a hug. Ohh  hug!\nLook at that. Alright. 5  4  3  2  1. It's 8 pm. Congratulations  Adam.\nThank you  buddy. You get to brag about that\nfor one week  and then you don't get to\ntalk about it again. Sam  you've been bested\nonce again. Wait  I guess I have\nsomething for you. Yeah! Alright. It's the season three trophy. You ready for it  Adam? Oh my gosh.\nWhat is it? Oh my god. This is a heavy one. Ohhh!\nOhhh! Oh my god! It's so incredible! Oh! They've increased the\nquality of that by so much. We have the money to afford such\na nice digital trophy this time. Oh my gosh. I love it. If you're wondering why I lost  it's 'cause I had to lug that\nwhole thing around Europe. Yeah.    So true.\nReally weigh me down. Yeah. Oh man. Alright. Let's find a hotel. I'm jet lagged. Ohh  he said the thing!\nGottem! Caption+ by JS*\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus He said the thing! That's it  we're done!\nSeason three's over! ...Sort of. I'll explain. So of course  we really need to\nthank all of you for your support. The support this season\nhas been crazy. You all have been so nice in your feedback.\nThe channel's grown like crazy. And we need to especially thank\nthe support of our Nebula subscribers. Because our Nebula subscribers \nquite literally  are funding the show. It could not work financially\nwithout them. In appreciation for that \nwe made a 45 minute long  Nebula-exclusive aftershow. We dive deeper into\nsome of the strategy  we answer some questions  we show some deleted scenes\nand extra footage. It's pretty great.\nI think y'all will enjoy it. It's basically giving you all\nwhat you have already asked for. And it's only on Nebula.\nNebula-exclusive. It'll albees—\nalways be Neblus-s— (sputtering) Nebula-exclusive  to thank\nthe Nebula subscribers. But the good news is if you're not\nalready a Nebula subscriber  it's actually super-cheap\nand easy to sign up. Let me explain. So basically \nNebula  we co-founded it. I co-founded it with\na bunch of other creators. And it was made to be\nthe best home to our content. So we designed it from the ground floor\nto just support good videos. And that means  for example \nit's not ad-supported. It's supported through a paywall. So we're not incentivized to just\ndo the thing that gets the most views. We're incentivized\nto make the best videos. Make the best videos that get people\nto sign up and get people to stay. It also doesn't have an algorithm \nso we're not trying to appeal to an algorithm with\nclickbaity titles or anything. So that means we're able to make\nexclusive videos  higher-budget videos  that just couldn't work\nfinancially on YouTube. And then we actually partnered\nwith Curiosity Stream  which is a whole other\nstreaming site which has all sorts of nonfiction\nshows and documentaries  a lot of which are made by\npretty big names. Massive catalog  lots of great stuff. And if you go sign up at our link \ncuriositystream.com/jetlag  any of those subscriptions there\ninclude a Nebula subscription  for as long as you stay subscribed \nand here's the thing. When you go to our link \nthey're running a sale only at our link. less than fifteen dollars a year to sign up for Curiosity Stream \nand that includes Nebula. So that would be a great deal\nfor one streaming site  but it's for two streaming sites \nand you get to watch this Nebula-exclusive aftershow right now  and for next season \nand every Jet Lag beyond  you get every episode early.\nIt's such a good deal. So it's worth going to that link \nand you'll be supporting the show. And you'll lock in that\namazing pricing. Click the button on screen \nor head over to: Watch the aftershow.\nWatch season four early. Which by the way  my flight for that\nleaves in exactly twelve hours. So I gotta go pack.\nBye!"

        "transcript": "we're playing Connect 4 but instead of connecting tiles we're connecting actual American states the ones that for grab are the 22 West of the Mississippi not Alaska and Hawaii cuz they're too far and not the East Coast ones cuz they're too janky and small and weird how we claim the state is we go to the actual state capital building and randomly draw a card from this deck on each card is a challenge we complete that challenge we claim the state once we have four states that can be connected either perfectly vertically or perfectly horizontally we win the teams are myself and Brian for real engineering and Ben and Adam who are not famous so they don't get to talk the game at a Chicago O'Hare Hilton and that means we have to get up at 4:00 a.m. so cut to us the most excited and energized we've ever been now what if I just turn off this is like the world's crappiest New Year's party wait wait it's about to happen here we go oh bye bye I hope you miss your flight all right strategy time yeah what do we do now all right Brian we got to figure out how where to go where are we going well we got to decide we're going to find out yeah so here I mean here's the deal right we've looked over the map there you know one big conclusion is like all states are definitely not created equal and we think the strongest two states are California and Nevada right we designed this game so we have had a lot of time to think about what the best potential first move is probably the most valuable combination is if you get California and Nevada that's really good Sam is probably in the other room right now talking your head off about that he's probably like oh Nevada Nevada every got to go to Nevada you have California and Nevada you can go up and claim Oregon and Washington or Oregon and Idaho due to this little weird border thing here or Idaho in Montana if you go east you can claim Utah Colorado Utah Wyoming Arizona and Mexico you have so many different options if you've claimed California and Nevada the problem is Ben and Adam probably also know that right but that's like half the reason we want to go there as well is like just not getting it is not an option okay we actually don't think that it makes sense to go to California and Nevada first and the reason is just that there aren't any good flights there the only way to get there is through connections early in the day there aren't any direct flight until late in the day yeah so let's let's check out the flights I would say that the most likely scenario is that they get on that nonstop to Sacramento that leaves quite late right it leaves at 9:00 a.m. doesn't get there till noon if we go to San Francisco we get there at 9:30 it's an hour and a half drive maybe 30 minutes to a rental car so we can get to Sacramento by 11:30 start claiming it before they even land right we can get a 6:00 a.m. flight to Denver and get there at 7:45 we would have landed in Denver they would still in the air the cool thing about Denver is that it's actually near Cheyenne Wyoming and so you can drive there claim Cheyenne and those are going to be really valuable I think later in the game because what I anticipate happening is that the whole west side of the board gets all like mixed up and stuff after a while and then we go to the East and then we'll have an advantage because we'll have eastern states and they won't but we really got to go yeah we got we got to go I mean I I don't really see a better move than this I mean I just can't think of any better move for than this to get California Nevada should we go ahead and book it then I think so we've done it Brian excited let's go to San Francisco I can't wait to spend three days with you s you got to hurry though if the security is bad we're [Music] screwed I'm coming with [Music] you it won't let me get my boarding pass so we got to run to the gate agent it won't let me get my boarding pass uh can is your ID please yeah feels like Christmas Sam Happy Christmas it's March thank you okay we're going to be fine all right Brian we got to sneak up to the gate okay in case they're there I don't see them I don't it's a good sign we're at the gate and consensus is that they're not here there you go have a good day thank [Music] you let me to stop the traic all right buddy we got to go go go we all right we're about to finally walk out into a the soon to be claimed state of Colorado our state there's our boy all right go ahead I think it looks like it's five well that ended up costing way more than we thought it would all right we got the rental car it ended up costing a million dollar because I accidentally booked it for March 10th instead of for today and they were not happy about that we're off to a bit of a rocky start here we go on our way to Victor Cheyenne I think Cheyenne yeah so if you're wondering why Ben and Adam are driving to Cheyenne Wyoming instead of claiming Denver Colorado where they just flew in let me explain basically they're messing with me right now I have no idea where they are and the way the rules work I'll only find out where they are once they claim their first date so they decided to do The Annoying Thing and drive to Cheyenne the capital Wyoming which will take two hours an extra two in which I don't know where they are then they'll go claim Denver because they have to get back to Denver International Airport anyways to get their next flight all right we are about halfway to Cheyenne we're going to be cutting things a little close we're trying to make a flight by 400 p.m and if Sam is doing what we think he's doing this move will really screw him so fingers crossed that this works [Music] out what what my God what is that what what is it's very giant come on how long is this thing this is this is fast oh no all right all right I'm going a different way all right rerouting reroute us Adam okay all right Adam tell the audience are in where we are the capital of the great state of Wyoming Cheyenne Wyoming and this right here is the capital building it's got a big weird golden dome over it but I'm pretty into it it's quite cool I think we'll give it five out of seven American flag O five out of seven I agree I have the cards we have not looked at them oh I'm so nervous I'm going to like throw up oh god there are so many cards that I don't want to pull okay I'm doing a shuffle then take one okay oh God all right this one we're going to take this one okay okay okay what is it what is it this card is catch three different local bugs catch we're doing the bug card baby let's go let's go I will be honest I'm not seeing a lot of bugs I'm not seeing a lot of bugs I just saw bugs zip past you did that confirms that there are bugs in Wyoming maybe we should drive somewhere drive somewhere that's going to have more bugs is there like a body of water like a body of water with I'll try and spot bugs out the window I really don't want us to spend a long time trying to catch the bugs there are birds birds might have bugs you want us to go manhandle a goose all right this feels like a much buggier area you getting strong bug vibes from here I'm getting huge bug Vibes over here keep your eyes peeled there's got to be bugs around here no bugs no bugs no bugs we have to catch three bugs and we have not really even seen one bug oh oh no that's just debris is it too [Music] cold why are there not any bugs I mean not even like an ant I'm Googling how to find bugs under wood like with trees potentially let's go to the other side although I'm feeling pretty disheartened about the bugs [Music] US Post Office ready to go s let's let's let's go do the thing Brian California state capital building oh we have to go to the capital building yep proceed to the rers I thought we could just go anywhere in the city no got to go to the capital building read the rules Brian [Music] come on this is like I feel like I'm going insane should be bug Central right here I got a bug baby I got a bug you got a bug you got a bug we got to get it on camera where is it what is it oh yeah that's a bug that's a bug that's a freaking bug look you can see it you see it crawling around in there there's a bug in there maybe you can't see it but there's a there's a bug in there and we have one bug oh I have a different bug different bug okay that's a different bug for sure that's two bugs my friend that is two bugs my friend we're two bugs up one bug to go let's go oh is that a that's an ant but we don't have an ant Adam get that ant I can force it under my finger that is an ant I I really want to make sure people can see if you look in here get a really good look there are two bugs in there this is the third bug we have all three bugs at the same time that's three bugs we did it baby we got three bugs three bugs three bugs three bugs in wyg time call Sam Baby Ben and Adam tried calling us to tell us they' claimed Wyoming but we were busy getting ripped off at the rental car place so they sent a video instead okay so we just got a video from Ben and Adam I'm going to play it while still looking at the road because I'm driving and respect the laws it's still in the air meanwhile while you were doing that we were busy claiming the first state of the game the great state of Wilding check it out look at that that's our state cowboy state actually don't know is the cowboy state I have no idea sounds right I'm going to put up on the screen what it is cowboy state baby it's our let's go okay well that's interesting uh I like those guys don't say that Brian okay so Wyoming's an interesting first choice I don't even like honestly I don't already know where Wyoming is I know it's north of Denver so I figured like I where would they fly into Wyoming they would fly to Denver and Drive North so they'd have to probably go back to Denver I mean good news is they're nowhere near us and we're almost certain to get California and Nevada now unless they like aerate here I'm hoping that when they see that we're in California they're going to panic and like fly directly west because they know how good of a combo California Nevada we have so many choices the problem though is I think that we just going to get three states before we get [Music] two here we are at the Colorado state capital what would we rate this Adam I mean it's quite nice I give it a a a 53 out of seven American flags 5.3 out of seven American flags that seems about right to me so still no word from Sam but we are about to get our second state so you better hurry up pick a card make it a good one please get one team member intoxicated you may get intoxicated at any bar in the states yeah baby Ben's getting drunk let's go I have to drive so Ben's getting drunk let's go all right let's find a bar walk I'm assuming we can walk to a bar got to look it up very quickly eat something because we have not eaten today we haven't eaten anything and you're about to take four straight shots I am a huge lightweight welcome to Denver's best dive bar I need to get four shots of vodka unfortunately got to down all four of those shots right yeah he does we're here in a very cool Dive Bar very cool um and Ben's about to get absolutely smashed okay you can do it there's one great job oh poison thank you very much I'm getting a lot of support number two perfect thanks very much you the viewer would have no way of knowing this but Ben like doesn't really drink a lot um like this will be by far the most I've ever seen him drink took a little break to uh reflect on my career shot number three you're doing it you're doing it take a minute there's it like I've definitely never had this much alcohol in my entire life what's going to happen the rest of the day what time is it 12:30 it's 12:30 it's only been 20 minutes and I'm going to down this last shot in a second number four [Music] oh I am now officially drunk in Colorado so that means it's time to call Sam and Bri that means it's time to call Sam and Brian what's up what's up oh you're in a owners of this great state of Colorado wait that's my state we don't even have one state yet Sam were we supposed to where is going to Chick-fil-A only certain states have Chick-fil-A that's true you went California ksas probably has chick has chick-fil I mean we're starting to to get nervous for you guys well I am too here's a question for you are you feeling better or worse than you were at the beginning of the morning uh in a way better in a way worse does that that does that make sense no I don't know it doesn't at all at all that might make more sense when once you've uh once you know where we are all right where are we Brian where is it nice job welcome to Sacramento do bit of split in the deck oh this is a lot of pressure it's magic we doing magic in a par kick one anyone is it the one I I oh no eat spicy food okay well we got to find a local Indian restaurant should we go back the car and research yes all [Music] right I'm so drunk the uh this is so bad the alcohol is really setting in for Ben we need to get him some food and some water as soon as possible here's going to be my strategy for TSA I'm going to do that and then I'm not even going to talk and they're not going to know that I'm drunk is it is it not allowed to go to the airport drunk I'm not sure is it not loud this is hot ones the show with hot questions and even hotter wings so we have to say verbatim I want the spiciest thing on the menu look like the spiciest thing you have one uh sure yeah and it turns out that basically all their spices in the sauce so they just gave us this little tiny thing of sauce that's supposed to be their spiciest sauce but that's what they suggested was the spiciest thing so we follow the rules so are you going to chug it no I won't chug that I think we just have to finish the sauce so how about you pour the sauce on the two samosas okay I made a mistake oh the chick are oh that is hot oh okay okay I think Brian definitely has I don't like spicy stuff we can get out of here by on less than an hour in Sacramento oh God that's hot oh oh okay was a little bit dry more full I'm handling this way worse than Brian I actually have like hot one style like some tears coming out but Brian's like completely fine cuz Brian lived in Malaysia for a bunch of years right all right I'm done Brian's basically done oh Brian's done we did it oh should we call the call the kids [Music] what tell me where you are eh take a guess you're in California yep I wish you were somewhere else I'll be frank well have fun in uh in Carson St y see you there I'm going to wait I'm sending Adam I'm setting myself the boarding pass cuz Ben is really drunk do you want to tell the people what's happening we're eating hi so we're at Denver Airport we have a little bit of time before our flight um we are required under the rules to eat one real meal a day um because if you don't put that in the rules a lot of times it won't happen um and our real meal is uh some classic uh this is awesome hours 35 minutes that's not bad do you want to go the interstate route that takes us over Doner pass or the Tahoe it's kind of the same yeah let's do the Tahoe one this one more off the Beaten Track it's only 3 minutes longer we can spare that yeah this is [Music] easy look at those gas prices oh man I didn't even think about that actually no we'll gas up in Nevada where gas prices will be lower it's all the taxes that raise it here anyway um so livs can't say that Brian look views look uh Wildfire or is that beetle kill dead trees I think that's Beetle K be what's that it's like the beetle that's infesting a lot of forests in the US and killing a bunch of trees that doesn't look like wildfire and it doesn't look like walking godamn beetles premium gasing Biden oh my God that was a joke you have to say it's a joke no the president doesn't control right our G section is going to be terrible it's fine by the time this goes out all the world's problems will have been solved right we should have voted Putin and we can't say that I think these trees are pretty resilient yeah so what you're saying is like wildfires are natural and climate change doesn't exist what I'm saying is that wildfires are natural and therefore we should let wildfires that don't threaten human infrastructure burn but the extent and frequency of wildfires especially in the context of once in Millennium brouts is exceptional [Music] look it is welcome to Carson City Nevada all right where are we son we are hopefully at the Nevada state capital Sam you're not allowed in that was a good joke Brian we're here in Nevada welcome to Nevada here's the capital Carson City yourself tell us who you are I'm they already know I'm Sam okay Shuffle Brian this is a very important PLL actually this makes her break whether we can make a flight tonight all right you ready mhm I'm nervous I'm worried full of strike oh that's not that's not that bad that's actually fun can we find a bowling alley though let's find a bowling Alle pretty good at bowling yeah 6 minute drive and it's 10 to 4 man I think we gotten really lucky with the cars between Indian food and this this isn't bad yeah all well let's go [Music] bowling see what happen Sam oh they I guess it was like all the lanes were used by it looked like legit Bowlers anyway there's another one nearby I think it's just that's not great for timing so you know probably going to be staying in Reno tonight very possibly there is a chance there's a decent chance I think that Ben and Adam would have uh would have uh Gone on a flight to here we don't think they could have gotten here by now but we didn't look that closely and you never know um so yeah we're we're beining it to the closest lane and then it's all going to be on Brian to get that strike quickly because uh I not a good bowler um I'll give it a shot I usually get at least one strike per game yeah but that does unfortunately make it a lot less likely that we'll be able to catch a flight tonight at a Reno and get to a hotel by 9:30 so that puts us in a little bit of a worse situation for tomorrow but again we're about to have Nevada and California which are s such an OP pair we're going to be fine right cut to us not being fine same is there's no way he can win we're pretty sure that he has really really limited options out of um Reno and if he does what we think that he's going to do which is basically his only good option um we're about to do something that's going to absolutely ruin him um we're literally so good at this game it's crazy Sam sucks at this game he was so cocky about how quickly he was going to win the game and he's completely screwed now [Music] ladies and [Music] gent thank you cool that's [Music] bad I my oh if you get this nice second go all right I know you couldn't see the strike but I promise it's real if you pause right here see no pins strike [Music] all right Ben we have a new video from Sam B hey Adam oh they got the bowling alley one I wanted to do that one we did the thing we're in Nevada we got it on the second shot anyway hope you guys are doing well two states FL Nevada we're having a nice relaxing evening play some bowling all right see you later they got lucky lucky all right I get the idea it doesn't matter we knew they were going to do that and we're going to be fine it's all part of our plan this is actually our third America Sam this is our third time at the Eagle but the second time Brian did that whole bit but he actually dally took a photo instead of a video it's a good photo Brian your mic's upside down we've been up for a long time okay so we haven't really discussed like what state we want to do next right so North our choice would be uh Idaho Oregon and Washington we need two of those three and we can't do we can't do Idaho Washington because that's not a straight vertical line we could only do like Oregon Idaho or Oregon Washington uh the other choice would be go east but I don't think Utah is useful because because they have Colorado so I'm pretty sure that's a clean block so we couldn't get four that way so if we get wi East it would be Arizona and New Mexico we don't know where they're going but considering they have Wyoming Colorado they might be going to Santa Fe but I would guess that they would be there by now hi and I'm feeling they're going to be trying to block us I think they will and I think they're going to go to Idaho if they go for Idaho then we we want what do we want we want Oregon yeah that will but then they could just block us in Washington but then in the process of them going to Washington we could go down to New Mexico and go and get the EAS r at that point why why wouldn't we just go immediately to the east route oh man there's so many variables right now this is when this gets hard today has felt like a cakewalk uh huh okay so perfect there's a 6 AM to Phoenix $23 that's not bad airus A320 Airbus scare buus okay so like we could get to Phoenix that would work it ain't boing I ain't going exactly okay so the first flight into Santa Fe gets us an 11 uh 11:19 a.m. 250 bucks that's not bad either it's a direct flight from Phoenix right right so that's through Phoenix so that's not bad if we wanted to jump a state and block them in case that they went to like Montana tonight thank you very thank very much I'm I'm assuming I think that there's a really good shot there in Boise and are just smart enough to know that you know not to answer the phone yeah my only fear is like if they manag to block off all the Eastern things and then we're in the East like if they have Phoenix we're kind of blocked off a little bit yeah it would be really bad if they got Arizona that's right we're in Arizona the Grand Canyon State baby well that's episode one done I sure

        "transcript": "all right so quick recap the game is connect four the board is america and the episode number is two so if you don't watch one this will all be nonsense to win a team must claim four states connected by a vertical or horizontal line states are claimed by going to the capital and completing a challenge and towards the end of day one the board looks like this and just so we can use the dramatic irony again the last thing i said was this yeah it would be really bad if they got arizona now let's go to adam and ben that's right we're in arizona the grand canyon stay baby sunny beautiful arizona i think it actually is the grand canyon state and uh this is the state capitol i i don't know what we this is a pretty good looking two out of seven this is like a two out of seven american flags this is not a very state capital i'm not very impressed ben pull a good one all right here we go the card is buy the local paper and solve one of the puzzles [Music] okay okay we can probably do that we can probably find a local paper it's 7 p.m so it might be a little difficult no local papers all right so we have to find a newspaper which we went to like a mini mart and didn't have them and then we checked into our hotel which was the just we just got the cheapest hotel that we could find they don't have any brian and i just checked in they gave us a free upgrade for some reason no idea why so look at this room brian and i each have one of these we paid 130 bucks probably gonna have some drinks you know get some dinner maybe do some gambling it's 6 p.m we're done for the night and we did the most strategically advantageous thing like it's not like we compromised so big fan of this so now we're actually walking to the airport where we were before um in an attempt to see if they have a newspaper we also have not confirmed that any of the newspapers actually have puzzles in them that's the situation please pirate hundred dollar bill [Applause] investors 31 or 13. okay the atlanta proceeds what does that mean we got all of those paid off [Music] everything's closed just like that 100 bucks becomes 200. see kids gambling does pay arizona republic okay prosper puzzle in a snowboard all right we got it can't imagine ben and adam are having uh done for the night in a 130 dollar one-room suite our hotel's name is howard johnson we're at the howard johnson i love that the hotel has a full person's name it's actually not called the howard johnson it's just called our job just like a guy we have a copy of the arizona republic the arizona republic which shook a stupidly long time to get like hours and it does have an insert two crossword puzzles and a sudoku but we are not going to do these puzzles tonight we are going to do them tomorrow so sam doesn't know where we are yeah because the best flight that they can make out of reno is to phoenix so we're hoping that they'll get to phoenix and then while they're in the air we'll claim phoenix and that will be very funny that will be very funny and we really hope that happens all right good night now we're getting some sleep because the first time we did a game like this there weren't any rules about sleep and it almost killed our cameraman so to solve it we fired the cameraman and also made a rule that you have to be in a hotel from 9 30 p.m to 4 30 a.m local time good morning good morning i wasn't expecting to have a camera in my face we're vloggers now brian where do you think we're going to end our day today brian [Music] i'm hoping it's not fair but how would that work the four states across yeah but we're going to santa fe now oh right yeah sorry i got a phoenix then yeah we only have a pen which is not good 38 across desert plants is cacti now this is good content hell yeah the people love this people are loving us solving a crossword puzzle slowly immediately 62 across layers of tire what's a layered look someone comment below is what a layer it is [Music] [Music] nymph what's a rhine nymph ben oh i wouldn't want to spoil it he's getting really nervous let's go to the airport we're back again filming in this weird we're crossing empty parking lots at five in the morning trying to solve a crossword puzzle okay we're really close here it's gotta be true aaa yeah you just gotta figure out what this is hey mom okay mom how is do you know how lorelai is spelled l-a-i at the end or l-e-i at the end l-e-i-l-e-i incredible thank you mom okay so we got today's crossword it's got the answers for yesterday's process and we have solved the crossword check for the sun we got it so that means that we have claimed arizona get god [Music] okay we just got to phoenix and while we were on our flight we got a video from ben and adam so we're gonna watch it now howdy sam and brian sam and brian we are in the beautiful grand canyon state arizona they're here they're in the airport we have just claimed it and god we hope so bad that you're on a plane to arizona right now oh my gosh i want so much for that to be the case wait they're at a southwest gate look at that that's the southwest gate because you know how they have like the boarding pillars yeah that's the southwest gate please please tell me that you'll be so friendly just anyway all right bye either d2 or d3 i think portland d3 they're going to portland they must be unless they're trying to do bus i feel like the only other choice would be santa fe so how about we go to our santa fe gate and if they're not there then we could like assume that they've probably gone to portland all right and then what do we do if they're not go to idaho maybe oh let's quickly go to the santa fe game see if we see them but if they're going to oregon i'll take them some time because they have to go all the way to salem salem right yeah and that's like an hour from portland so i have to get a rental car drive down claim it they'll take them a good like three four hours but arizona that forces us north so we have to get oregon washington or idaho montana i mean short of like searching the whole airport they're not here so i feel like we should operate on the assumption that they really got on that flight to port to portland yes you thank you okay um okay we are here in portland oregon we came here because sam just has too many easy paths to victory up north so we decided we had to just come up here and block him as quick as we could and this was as quick as we could get up here um the hitch is that uh we have to get back to the airport to board a flight at one so seeing as salem the capital of oregon is almost an hour from here we gotta really hurry uber's on its way uber's definitely the right call we don't have time to pick up a rental car or drop it off or drop it off so uber a little more expensive but worth it hit yeah i mean i think we're on the same page like santa fe doesn't make sense for us that would just be a purely defensive thing especially because that defensive if we can't win doesn't make any sense albuquerque is not a massive airport and santa fe is a tiny airport yeah yeah so we're gonna get stuck there yeah so they'll definitely get both and we'll be like we'll be trapped in her two states will be completely encircled yeah like i mean they've blocked off one of our three options and if they get portland and then usually we're gonna have to go to ipo as soon as one is one so that leaves in less than two hours what do you think did you just buy that all right two seats okay we're booked all right well we thought we were going to santa fe i was actually looking forward to going to santa fe but game comes first so we're off to boise idaho we're only like two or three flights a day i think non-stop from here to boise just happened that the next one an extra hour or so yeah and like was cheap so we're definitely really lucky a little update before we get to the capitol uh our uber driver warren uh has very generously offered to uh he's been helping us strategize he's actually really good at this game and he would definitely win if he was playing um but he has offered to uh to wait around for us uh and drive us back to portland or or elsewhere we need in in salem so uh this is gonna be really really helpful extremely helpful warren is uh gonna win us the game and that is incredible this is a crazy looking insane looking capital very cool i would give it six out of seven american play i also give it six out of seven it looks sort of dystopian but i sort of think yeah it's kind of scary all right we're in a hurry so we really should okay we are here in salem oregon the capital of oregon um we need to claim this state really really fast so i am going to present the cards to adam it's raining a little bit that's very on brand for oregon yeah okay okay um please be good for the love of god okay okay okay we i wanted to be good once [Music] bury a treasure [Music] oh we talked to you we didn't want this one okay the treasure must be worth at least 50 you must leave a conspicuous sign next to the treasure so that someone may find it it must be completely covered in at least three inches underground okay i think that we can do this though okay i think we can do this i think we just need to find some soft soil but we can't dig here this is like government property we can dig wherever we want okay oh we could go over into that dirt area yeah yeah this could work that should work the treasure must the full treasure must be three inches below the ground so it does have to be a little bit of a deep hole but i think we can do it so we don't really have time to buy anything to bury so we're going to have to bury some of our own stuff it has to be it worth at least 50 so we're going to bury adam's laptop charger because we know that that is worth more than 50 dollars and it's something that someone might want so um that's what's going underground difficult we'll say let's okay here's our sign hey we want a free laptop charger we buried ours under this tree please take it that should hopefully be clear enough to get someone to dig up adams laptop charger and use it for themselves i'm burying it [Music] we're burying carrying a treasure as part of a scavenger hunt if you want a free if you want a free laptop charger then you should uh come and grab it it should be really easy to dig up [Music] yeah you can once we leave you're gonna we're gonna leave this on and then please dig it up because we really want someone to take it we've already found someone who i think wants to dig up our treasure show one two three yeah it's easily three inches all right it's here's our sign [Music] it's not garbage this kid is gonna dig it up and claim a free laptop charger it's free it's yours it's worth 80. that means that we have claimed oregon baby [Music] so we got another video so let's go find everything quite a spot and make sure that they get there greetings from oregon losers what's up we got organ get wrecked okay well that was that was great that was pretty your videos are much better than this but we're gonna have to rush them kind of but they're like running you know is that yeah they're like booking we need to run we should figure out they're probably like russian get back to a fight hey hello this is bryan mcmanus reporting from the state capital of idaho i don't know here re restart i don't know if i was recording hello my name is brian mcmanus no i'm going to start that again hello this is bryan mcmanus reporting from the state capital of idaho 222. so i'll go to this one bless you find a statue and recreate it a statue must be at least 100 meters from the capitol building why is it in meters or in america you must not use the internet to locate a statue you must hold the post for at least five minutes five minutes we could go in and find a statue of jesus is that not okay what is it would it be a bit faux pas to recreate a statue of jesus on the cross um that'd be a tough position to hold for five minutes so what are we doing sam cause brian forgot to record and i'm saying this extemporaneously we're gonna go on the roof of this parking garage and get a view to try to find like a park or something oh elevator access requires state access card present access card damn it let's go to the other one unless we can no just all right uh security [Music] noise we're on the government parking garages hopefully we don't get gunned down by security or something i don't see any super close parks no there's a hospital there i feel like a hospital could have a statue what if we commission a statue all right it's starting to take some time yeah and for all we know they're on the way to somewhere yeah i don't think they can get there today though we should double check i don't think they can we are going to make our really tight flight um that we were really worried about that we think almost sort of guarantees that we're going to be able to win i mean not 100 but like pretty close we have enough budget left for like one big play tomorrow morning which we think we can use to win the game um but if anything goes wrong like this flight gets messed up or our play in the morning gets messed up or sam has done something we didn't expect all of those things would essentially take us off the board and then we're toast oh i feel like we're in the perfect spots for statues but but alas we need to write a letter the governor of idaho it's like yo maybe any remaining trip budget we we give to idaho to make more statues specifically more than 100 meters away from the capitol yes i feel like that's a big hospital look at that that i feel like a big hospital like that could have like a little memorial thing you know uh uh posed as a piece of trash i'll do that every day so that was the joke brian you can't make a joke out of my joke i commandeered your jokes that is a that is a statue a child a green giant i mean is it a statue is it a i mean what else would you describe it as that's a statue but it's not do it do you think that's i don't know if it counts as a statue i feel like what else would you describe it as a street sign probably i think that counts as a status let's do a lap around that seems like you can find something more suited this is like a perfect statue this one is just like a standing straight up it's not problematic it's all good why is it in their memory though their bodies doesn't say that both of us have to do it so i'll just look like i'm talking to you okay well i guess you can't talk because then you wouldn't be still don't you want to do it right here oh wait you can't respond [Music] it's dedicated to the memory of 610 graduates of st luke's hospital training school for the nurses also i guess we're at st luke's hospital i'm going to look up what that is luke's hospital hotel on wikipedia why is it only 1906 to 1956 kind of cool i can't all be dead right no i really don't have enough snacks it's pretty easy actually i think we have enough time for lunch here seconds until fruit snacks okay you may have the fruit snacks i don't  want the honey you want fruits they definitely all died in a fire by the way [Music] how about let's go find a spot to sit down away from here and figure out uh oh god damn it ryan kicked it so i stopped the fall apologize to graham the audio editor sorry graeme i love you uh is really annoying me what is he such a ticket [Music] trying to feed me snacks snacks don't need your stupid snacks you sorry i can't hear you you have to speak up i'm talking to you talking to ground brian how did we miss the polar bear we could have been a polar but then you'd have to be on all fours for five minutes and maybe on a roof too where do you think we are sam what's your i wanna i wanna hear a what do you think should we tell them oh we have to tell them oh i guess you're correct you uh you kind of screwed us this morning no you didn't a little bit because we were you don't get to tell them what we were doing okay fine no that's just that's giving away info that they don't need so where were you where are you all going now uh we couldn't possibly say i'm actually gonna hang up because i'm worried that the person is going to announce where we are going um so i am hanging up wait one second um so that's actually a useful intel they're in the airport is the camera recording yes okay so they're in there they're in the airport and presumably i'm zoomed in though third time i mean we should keep that in mind so they're in the airport and leaving presumably pretty soon if he's worried that there i have my own if if if they're worried that they're about to announce it so we should check the departure board i think brian might be losing it okay our flight is boarding so we gotta talk quick sam just claimed idaho which is exactly what we were hoping was gonna happen which means that he did go to phoenix and get the video of us while he was in the air i can't wait to watch his reaction to that oh my god so and the fact that he has idaho means that it's really really good that we're going the place that we are about to go let's just say it's about to get hairy up north um i'm feeling amazing about the decisions that we have made quite frankly we'll see you soon okay so let's start by checking which flights they could reasonably on reasonably beyond so salem i mean it looked like they were at a pretty big airport so i'm assuming they didn't go to like a regional airport like eugene or something yeah okay so portland okay so let's go down the list of the ones that they could feasibly be on in the next hour yeah los angeles salt lake city minneapolis tucson seattle san diego dallas los angeles new york seattle among those i'm guessing that they're connecting through somewhere and dallas that's a big connecting hub but they would get into late unless they just like overnighted there um minneapolis i think similar deal yeah they were getting at 7 pm i don't think they could connect and get anywhere useful um salt lake city it gets in at 421 so they could possibly get somewhere useful um [Music] the only thing that matters right now is montana montana is our only winning unless they figured out that like it's going to take us a minute to get montana and are just going to like speed new mexico texas across tomorrow or something but i don't think they would win that i feel like with this departure board unless they somehow had some seattle connection and i didn't see any um useful flights from seattle to the montana airports i'm gonna guess it's this they're going through salt lake city at 1 35. so let's check let's check connections through salt lake city okay so they could not get to bozeman through salt lake city check helena [Music] they could get they could connect to butte burt mooney airport which is like this tiny it's in butte montana which is tiny i'm tiny airport but it's nearby it's like within salt lake yeah let's check missoula [Music] they couldn't make missoula um okay so that butte burt mooney airport that would be a problem arriving at 6 57 p.m so plenty of time for them to get in a hotel [Music] okay that would be i mean they've historically not been very good at like looking for alternate airports but i feel like they might have learned oh yeah so look at that they're still leaving seats available on that itinerary 405 bucks oh that's where's that coming from that's going from portland to salt lake city salt lake city to bert mooney airport oh damn it there are rental cars available from butte montana oh we might have just been uh vested a bit what time does the that flight leave up 135 it's like the timing or the flight sullivan was at 135 well what time does it leave salt lake is there any reason we couldn't get to salt lake and get that flight i mean their flight to salt lake city is leaving in like 20 minutes so yeah i know but that means we should check sure but don't even want that matter is if we can get on it then it's just a straight race oh wait a minute because there are flights to salt lake city city from here [Music] oh wait we can okay let's do it oh okay we need to get to the airport uh 3 46 so it's leaves in an hour and a half i was just assuming that we couldn't i guess we're geographically closer so if you have leaves later oh man that would be okay i i did not think we were gonna get to montana tonight still a big if that would be hilarious if we both ended up on that random ass flight oh how uh what if i told you that we woke up and ran out today how surprising is that we're not even close to done [Music] hi all right we've just landed in salt lake city utah which would be a really great state for us to claim but actually we are not going to claim it nope we have a connection to a flight that will get us somewhere that we think is actually a much better plate in utah what is it you'll find out [Music] and yours you're good i feel amazing thank you i'm kind of excited [Music] i mean we missed the first bus there's a chance they were on the first bus we couldn't see them through the window when it was pulling alive [Music] once we get airborne a flight time should be roughly 50 minutes oh man what a cliffhanger well guess what you can watch the final episode of connect 4 right now on nebula the streaming service i started with my other creator friends once you watch that you can watch privacy which was actually our pilot season of jet lag the game basically adam and ben made a map of the 24 weir slaws in the united states and gave me 72 hours and 5 000 to break eight of them but they had a live tracker on me and if they tagged me i

        "transcript": "okay so here's the state of the game right now oh and if you don't know what the game is they need to go back and watch episodes one and two because they're about to be major spoilers exactly now if brian and i can claim montana we'll be able to connect four states and win the game ben and adam are currently sitting on a tiny plane in salt lake city that's about to take off to butte montana and as it just so happens that's the exact flight me and brian just boarded this is gonna be an interesting finish [Music] we were like if they're not on this flight we win [Music] my god oh my god if for some reason we can't get into this airport [Music] okay so there's a there was an open seat next to sam so i've sent ben to go sit in it so that he could get out first because the car is under his name [Music] focus i forgot my code at adam's apartment so i am not happy about this oh that's an affordable takeoff well i don't know what it is because like visibility doesn't seem bad just to give you a quick update we came in here to view the approach and due to the fact that the winds are going out of the north at about 20 miles an hour and it says we have to do what's called a circle of land and land on the other runway then certainly maneuver is kind of a tight one the low clouds and made it for some very poor visibility keep everybody safe we are at this point going back to salt lake city we hope you understand and appreciate the safety of the matter we will be arriving salt lake here shortly we'll let you know [Music] how did you see him that was a bit of a curveball yeah literally was it literally it's kind of a purge definitely have more money than us so they're going to go to a nicer hotel well probably like a lot of hotels are booked so we need to go and i would encourage you to be quick too we have been forced to buy a much more expensive hotel than we would have liked because it's the only option available but uh ultimately we're actually feeling really good because weirdly this is actually great for us because it gives us a chance to grab utah before either of us can get to montana which means that if we get montana we actually win now so sort of a weird blessing in disguise we think the game's going to end in montana assuming we can get utah tomorrow morning yeah i just want to watch the rugby i told you not to get in the mindset of being able to watch the rugby if it'll predict the snowstorm stopping us from landing probably a meteorologist okay so our flight was rescheduled to 7 45 tomorrow morning that means that if either team wants to claim utah they'll have just over three hours to do it after we wake up good morning sam good morning brian it's the last day yeah it's gonna be the worst day i think why you know why okay uh we have to go claim utah because they're doing the same yes okay let's go let's get an uber [Music] good morning my friends it is sometimes it's like 4 17. yeah it's like 4 20. blaze it head to the utah street it's gonna be beautiful [Music] hello sam hey how you doing [Music] i think joe biden will be awake when we get there [Music] probably not in front yes sir all right so if you just get in front and just let us out we'll just run right up i'm filming all right come on go go go go go go pretty pretty it's pretty majestic okay i think i would give it seven okay okay well let's draw cards together let's draw cards together okay fair enough okay all right okay okay here we go it's the way i'm shuffling your pulling right we were hoping you guys would just sleep in uh all right okay all right i'm shuffling one sec this is my hotel room card this is my money um oh wait your wrong pocket card all right ready one two three go big one hey eat the state dish we can't do that yeah yeah we can't do it detail plant a local paint a local landscape yeah we can just miss it because there's nowhere i'd say for that get a pedicure there's no there's not gonna be anywhere open dismiss okay there's not gonna be any more open dismiss dismiss attend a local event i'm definitely gonna well okay we can claim that we can't do that and then we get a free another draw paint your teammates faces state flag we can do that okay all right where can we get paint we got to get to like a dwayne reed or something dwayne reed we're not in new york anymore adam here start start calling an uber there's a cvs 2.3 no it opens at 9am oh god what's open right now look for a walmart look for walmart mom baby what is it go to a museum actually doesn't have a open rule if there's not an open museum within 20 miles we can just pull another card okay let's look for a museum within 20 miles oh god okay we got to use our second veto uh there's nothing nothing's gonna be open until 6am we're vetoing okay we're gonna use our second video so we're out of vetoes now we're gonna pull our last card okay what is that it's a bus no no let's go to like a hotel or something there will be someone at the front desk maybe we can busk in front of them what means i'm going to be open to five i don't know sex museum no chance i think we gotta pull another one it's gotta be good brian [Music] eat the steak dessert oh okay let's look up the state dessert oh this sucks so bad we got to earn a dollar we could try and go to the airport maybe in front of the airport let's go to the airport that's smart that's smart here let's start making a sign we're gonna rap we're gonna rap right right adam you've got a wrap in you at 5am jello jello is easy we could make joe okay i'm actually the same dessert yes that's what it has i remember this and on brand yellow okay we need a grocery store we can do this we can do this how far away is the uber [Music] what i thought you got the uber no oh maybe i did no i did i did i did never mind oh my god they're so far away 18 minutes away oh wait wait wait i'm so sorry my name's adam and i'm here to say we need one dollar in a major way okay so yeah please stop well that was unfortunate he does not enjoy that i'm wait i'm gonna try for any cars coming by just do a little jig oh my god he's like stopping cars on the street jesus christ 4 30 a.m thank you so much thank you good job adam [Music] we got it baby these are houses literally [Music] sam yeah we've just uh this is the greatest moment of my life bye fellas see in montana [Music] so we're going to pentana i mean there's not really another option they've no money man yeah but they they have the flight as long as they can get a rental car which i assume you can because flight's just same one from last night yeah and they have six states in route three yeah i guess so yep gotta gotta get montana so kind of 50 50 shot [Music] see you there fellas [Music] very close to my face we made it this time i'll steal your wife go go go go [Music] go you won't need to play being bullied in this airplane and you need to stand up in front of him [Music] oh here we go [Music] all right give this a thus look for signs for avis rental cars this way [Music] they're not they're not open yet they're not open yet i've never seen something like this they're not open until 10 a.m oh no everything's cold okay we're gonna have to try hertz after them okay thank you very much thank you [Music] very fortunate [Music] yeah i mean it's gonna take them a while it looks like they went to hertz to try to yeah to try to rent with their because it could take a while to like put their info and stuff yeah that was um that definitely bought us at least five minutes [Music] we might be losing that five minute advantage already these doors yeah i think so okay oh it's chilly okay we made it okay so they our car rental place avis was not open it didn't open until 10. so we had to switch to hertz which meant that they got out only a couple minutes before us so we're right behind them but they are ahead they are ahead a little bit but they're ahead gorgeous lots all right so here's the deal um we're very strict about speed limits on this so that none of us get an advantage by breaking the law you can see i'm going 43 and we're in 45 we'll try to get us exactly 45 but we're being both we both agreed to be very strict with speed limits especially with the roads being a little bit icy i don't want to crash and die for the sake of youtube content i mean actually would make good content yeah but on the other hand if it's adam and ben it's pretty good content engine coolant temp high stop check engine [Music] okay okay we need to we need to pull over it's like not letting me go very fast okay we went a little too fast and now the car is freaking out drive start control malfunction it's a little drive start control malfunction we're kind of just gonna we're gonna take it slow for now and hope maybe that goes away maybe that'll go away what do you think adam i don't know adam doesn't know okay open up the owner's manual open up the owner's manual yeah throw your bag somewhere oh okay okay we've pulled over on the side of the road i'm doing some light reading in the okay hurry hurry toyota corolla [Music] this is great entertainment well the coolant will cool down and i think what happened is that the car the woman at the car rental place mentioned that she had not started up the car earlier that day which i think means that the something was too cold and by going fast again we did not go over the speed limit but we sped up to 80. we sped up to 80. we overheated the engine somehow so i'm hoping that if we just sit here well we don't have many other options because i don't i don't know if you know your way around the engine of a toyota corolla okay i'm gonna call the hertz uh see if maybe if they know um we just rented a car from you guys like maybe 15 or 20 minutes ago and it's it seems to be having a problem the engine coolant has overheated or something do you know what to do okay great dani just keep on going okay okay great thanks very much thanks bud bye i sure hope sam and brian are doing something entertaining right now for you i see the appeal of montana on my empty beautiful species i like the snow too there's now snowing on the road and i'm a little bit uncomfortable i'm not we were kind of doing some doing some math i think they have six cards and i think we have eight left so that's what like uh 14 total that means out of 14 cars there are there are uh three that are claimed the state immediately and for either of us even though they're like five minutes behind us um for either of us if either of us pull one of those it's game over right there so that's a distinct possibility this could be this could be done very quickly or not um what about the card that says we have to book our next flight without using i i looked at the language of that and i think how it works is it says claim the state immediately but in order to book your next flight you must do this okay we don't have to book a next flight okay and we've claimed the state immediately therefore we've got connect four i'm pretty sure wow sam you're so diligent with the speed limit so responsible so i sure hope ben and adam are being so responsible too so we're presently freezing to death it's very cold in the car the heating doesn't seem to really be like working as well as it feels like it should be so right now we're less concerned about winning the game and more concerned with living is what i would say hey this is what the engine sounds like i don't know if you can hear the engine but it sounds really bad and it also smells really not right it might explode but i still want to sit in the car cause it's so it's so cold here [Music] you should you need to get my jacket you're you're you need more layers buddy i'm fine i don't know take my insulated no no put my jacket on you got gloves and a hat once i put my gloves in half put your gloves and hat on here's an extra sweatshirt and a jacket check out my uh my new fit it's called the ben doesn't die in a broken down car in montana we died doing what we loved losing connect4 to sam the check engine visit your dealer drive start control malfunction okay okay we think they're here we think that's them behind us although they asked us not to film them so yeah we might have to do yeah okay jump cut to our new car we are gonna get back on the road as fast as possible yeah and then we're gonna catch up and we're gonna win there's our old car here i i'm so worried that people are gonna think we faked this somehow um okay we don't know enough about cars to fake this okay new car wave goodbye to the old car my old car show it in the rear view mirror i think you can see it anyway um okay we're trying to catch up to sam we're not that far behind we think we can catch up if he gets a bad card so fingers crossed we're still in this game i don't know about you but i am tense i feel like the same way that i feel like when i'm like about to go on the ice of the hockey game or something or or like i don't know about to release a big video or something i am tense heart is part is racing brian's probably just like why can't i watch rugby i'm a sociopath so see that starbucks i stopped at that starbucks on a road nobody cares yes they do any final thoughts oh god i'm so nervous and i don't even know why that's too zoomed in i'm sorry come on brian come on come on this is the crucial moment okay let's go all right i got the cards for you we got the cards quick shuffle it's gotta be a good shuffle we don't want anyone disputing this come on show the camera okay is that a good enough shuffle yeah oh this is a lot of pressure what do you think that one yes yes how you feeling adam you know i think there's still a chance they could veto themselves into a corner with pedicure or um the local event um and if they do those things and we can get something quickly we still have a shot snowing and the roads are getting a little snowy so we're driving responsibly all right we're 10 minutes out from helena still no call from sam which means he hasn't claimed the state i think we're still in this thing we just got to get a good card when we get there you know ben four out of seven american flags it's kind of underwhelming it's a little drab a little drab it's a little dram you know i'm sorry to say it i think i'm going four out of seven american flags all right here we go here we go do you have the cards i've got them in my wallet all right let's go we are here in beautiful helena montana and it's very cold and also they've had a huge head start so we're going to pull these cards as fast as possible we're going to do a little shuffle shuffle shuffle shuffle our last shuffle of the game okay adam all right good one good one [Music] eat the steak dish [Music] okay you must eat at least one serving of the dish okay so that is hey guys oh no did you already get it they were hiding do you want it do you want to see what i have here [Music] congratulations [Music] you had to hide behind the thing well we okay yes we did why'd you do that we thought it would be suspicious oh you're right all right sam and brian you have won connect four congratulations oh good job you guys played a good game well done you guys have your gloves all set yeah cause we almost died in the cold we didn't have time to make a trophy but our editors are gonna photoshop a trophy into my hands right now okay you ready and now i'm gonna hand it be careful it's heavy oh my god the editor did such a good job with this all right and now

        "transcript": "all right we're about to race to Circuit navigate the world first I want to get back here to Denver Union Station and touch this flagpole wins I'm gonna go for a walk oh all right all right let's go go no I think let's go let's try going this way [Music] this way I just checked we don't need to rush too much the train doesn't leave for 15 minutes to the airport so no running how do you howdy [Music] we can start talking strategy now right okay so one big thing that uh Ben and Adam don't know is my dad works for American Airlines and he's working right now any Insider information we need about American flights that is good yeah we can call them the cinema the problem is I think American flights are expensive and the name of the game you know since we accumulate budget by doing challenges want to keep it cheap each team starts with a thousand dollars to earn more money we have to do challenges from this list but we'll talk more about that later let's buy tickets and then talk about how to do that let's get airport tickets where are those kids look at them they look so confident this is our foes our competition if you can even call with that so true dude okay so the first step is to get to Denver International Airport we're in Denver Union Station we're gonna have to get on a flight to get started we should actually hustle a little bit I'm really making a statement [Music] s the train doesn't leave for 12 minutes I'm gonna start looking up flights to the east coast basically the way that this is definitely going to go is that we're going to fly to the east coast and then we'll get a flight across the Atlantic now my assumption is that we're going to go to New York because biggest Hub and it's probably going to be the cheapest place to get to from Denver but I need to double check that there they are [Music] Ben and Adam has started with a huge leg up because you know we have jobs yeah to be fair they have jobs but it just happens at their job is creating the scan yeah you don't have opportunity for simulation we did we definitely don't we're gonna we're gonna beat them so hard I could basically all my work into the transatlantic Life by creating the spreadsheets like I went through every International Airport in the US looked at the cheapest flights were put on this convention when I calculated each by the cost per mile here's the thing the cheapest system cost per mile flights are ones that I don't think they're gonna know about and here's why okay they're charter flights and charter flights don't show up on Google flights so you don't think these are in their simulations unless they specifically went to the chewy website yeah looked from Cancun to all across Europe they wouldn't have found it so we're going to Cancun maybe get a 7 A.M to Chicago it's not terrible where could we get to from Chicago well we could get to Iceland the problem is going to Iceland doesn't really actually give you much more distance right there's a minimum distance requirement that we have to hit in order for it to count so you can't just like go up to the Arctic Circle and go around and usually if you're adding an extra stop you would want to add distance but Iceland's exactly on the way it's like yeah okay the cheapest flooding people the only one that we can afford to both we have support current budget a thousand bucks without doing a challenge is an afternoon that leaves at 3 10. so I'm pretty sure this will get us to Europe for that we just think that New York New York has the most options and it's also like one of the cheapest places for us to get right now it's kind of the obvious play but the reason it's the obvious play is that I think it's the best play it's also the greatest city in the world that's so true yeah so it seems like we have a choice do we want to be risk here in Denver with getting a flight it's more risky or making a connection because we're gonna get to the airport at 5 55 and then there's the 7 A.M Frontier flight okay or we could take an 8 A.M United flight they'll be assessed with a two hour later what do you think is the best Strat here I really don't know so 7am yeah let's just do it okay all right wow we've got our boarding passes okay so it says we can't get a broadcast which is a problem because we have a really tight time at the airport yeah so uh we were not uh counting on this all right we got lucky in the train arrived like five minutes early but we really gotta yeah I know should we join the runners yep that's good [Music] yeah that security line is looking chunky oh wow it keeps going that is not a good scary line well this is bad uh oh God oh no [Music] you see the huge mass of people yeah that's the frontier line [Music] oh my God oh my God never seen anything like this I don't know if we're gonna make our flight then you get it to work no what the my words thank you that's the general so I don't think it's open so it's good for security so this is like a secret I keep walking keep walking yeah all right I mean this looks much better fingers crossed it's still a chunky line it's all chunky but not like well I checked the wait time this is the quickest so this is our our best shot so there's actually a way shorter security line that's kind of hidden on the bridge to Terminal A so that's the one we're going to but Ben and Adam definitely don't know that we've been wanting to find the end of the line for like five minutes this could take hours how is this possible oh we found the end of the line not exaggerating this line is more than half a mile I mean this is one of the most insane things that I mean there must be some horrible problem at Denver International right now just by the way if we don't make this fight to Cancun all the money we spent on our tickets will be gone and we'll be stuck in Denver doing challenges for God knows how long until we can afford new ones okay so while we're waiting to find we have nothing to do um we're gonna try and apply for our Thailand e-visas because those might take up to 48 hours to process so if we're gonna go through Thailand we got to do this like now so the reason Ben and Adam are applying for Thailand passes is because of this flight from Paris to Bangkok on Thai Airways it leaves every day at 1 40 in the afternoon and it's one of the absolute cheapest ways to get from Europe to Southeast Asia usually just over 400 a person if they can get to Europe fast enough to get on this flight it could give them a huge advantage doors closed in five minutes Joseph back up full size so I'm going and pleading we already closed it I'm just kidding it's fine it's so boring dude I ran so hard yeah that's like the hardest I've ever had what do you think I'm gonna guess if they went through that other line I think no I didn't see them in our security line so so hopefully they missed their Club yeah hopefully I've never hoped that somebody missed a fight before you know in competition in an in-friendly competition I'm a little worried I am very worried it's gonna be tight it's gonna be really tight all right it's right ahead all right we are um all right we are on the flight to New York and uh we're gonna start looking for our next flight out of New York to Europe okay so look at all these big numbers 1300 1200 1600. but if you zoom into Italy what do you find you can get some Milan for 8.44 that's for the both of us and better yet it's like at a perfect time it's on a airline called NEOS this flight happens once a week only on Thursdays we've seen it before in the simulations leaves at 5 p.m we get into New York at 1pm so we have about four hours to do challenges and all we'll have to do is earn about 300 in order to get on this flight which should be very doable there's nowhere that we could go bungee jumping in New York right I don't think that we could get too easily we could probably buy the hat but I want to earn more money though yeah we could try to catch a fish but it feels like too big of a risk there could be ketchup Ketch of fish in New York oh and by the water I mean go to the ocean can't touch snow eat a bug probably not local liquor not enough money hardcore video maybe paintball no no I really think it's the pastry mile I think you're right I think that's that's just our best option by far Sam and Joseph were not on our flight to New York they're going to New York they've been on that flight so I wonder where they are [Music] all right we made it yep we got through stuff wanted we're in Cancun and I was excited to go to Milan uh but we still don't have enough money to book that flight we're still like 300 ish dollars short plus we'll need to book continuing flight after that right um so we have to do a challenge we're gonna do the local pastry Mile and we'll explain what that is in a minute foreign pastry shop and it's only a few meters from a track so it's a really good spot we're here because the local pastry mile is going to involve one of us Adam running a mile but after every single lap and before it starts he has to eat one local iconic pastry to the region which is New York yeah so let's go uh yeah can I get three red velvet Donuts uh can I also get a black and white cookie can I just get one more red velvet Donuts you actually get two I'm gonna eat one foreign got three of these [Music] and then we've got one of these and it's massive oh it's I'm Gonna Save that one for the end three two one go how's the donut I mean it's really good they're giving you the power you need to run one mile it's really dense thank you all right that's donut number one down go Adam you got this Adam was the best track and field runner in his hometown back in high school so I have every faith that uh he has what it takes [Music] we're trying to figure out how to navigate through this airport yeah it really wants you to lose it's like it shuttles you into like this area with tons of shuttle things yeah there's like no way out so we're trying to get around yeah donut number two how are you feeling really bad all right go go go lap number two I don't think our flight's on the board yeah I mean it's like a special Charter right all right let's look around I guess water at least this one has a chunkness I think that's kind of good I genuinely don't know if I can do this [Music] three you got this all right turns out we got to take a shuttle to Terminal Two here's your water okay do you want the donut or do you want the cookie the only Donuts let me try the cookie okay I'm not gonna finish a bite this Chewbacca has to be the donut donut number four he's gonna take a little rest look at that it was a big chunk of that donut you just got there you're an inspiration oh all right we're checked in got the got the tickets I don't think we have so it's 1 p.m flight music 3 20. yeah uh and all challenges have to be done five miles away from the airport so I don't think we have time no with only two hours no I don't think we've got time enough to go out and do one well now you have more room in your stomach I just want to say this now if we do win this race it will have been earned and we wouldn't be able to do a very big challenge we'll only be able to do a low value one yeah so I say let's just don't worry about it yeah are you okay do you need to stop [Music] he's off he's off folks [Music] foreign take a little lie down Adam take a little lie down are you ready to go to Italy all right we just got word they completed their first challenge they did a pastry mile well they were running a mile and we're eating Panda Express I think we're the real winners here and we're also about to be on the flight to Europe already and they're not yeah so I think we're still I think we're still ahead yeah see I wonder where they are sorry to all the nice people at McCarran Park whose afternoons I've ruined if it makes you feel any better we're going to be leaving the country immediately okay Adam I don't mean to alarm you but that flight is gone this is another one there is another one it's not that much more expensive and it only leaves a half hour later the Neo's flight is gone we're gonna take this Delta flight gets us in a little later but this is all we got without that Neo's flight Ben and Adam are going to get to Europe later and with less money than they thought they might be acting chill now but it's going to make their already tight plan even tighter all right we've got our uh tickets to Italy not on the flight we wanted but on one that's just a half hour later and a little bit more expensive I I did a little research I'm pretty sure I have a confident guess on which flight they're on I'm pretty sure based on when they complete their challenge It lines up with how long it would have taken them to fly to the east coast yeah and kind of get out of the airport if they flew to say New York but in New York there's a very cheap flight to Milan leaving at 5 30 getting in at 7 45 a.m tomorrow on Delta it seems to be the cheapest East Coast Flight available our competitive Advantage is uh our distance we have more distance so they're they're going to run into distance issues later or not so my absolute pure chance uh-huh right now I'm uploading a video about character no way it's about it's about how Cancun was like discovered by a computer as the mathematically perfect vacation destination and this is the was the mathematically yeah most perfect yes and and then Mexico like invested in it because it was mathematically perfect that is really interesting this was totally true total by chance literally right now uploading this video we were we were kind of worried that we were going to miss our flight but good news it got delayed also bad news that got delayed our odds of getting to Paris in time to make the flight to Bangkok which were already tight it might have just become impossible we'll just have to find another route yeah okay so our flight to Milan is now getting in at 8 30 which is two hours later than we thought we were going to get in when when we thought we were going to get in at 6 30 there was this route we had in mind where we were gonna fly back to Paris at 9 10 and then take a 140 flight to Bangkok which is really cheap and one of the best ways to get to South East Asia now it seems like that's not possible because we would have to get on a 9 10 to Paris and we're gonna get in at 8 30. and we would have to earn the money to buy that flight to Paris in Milan in 40 minutes so we're probably gonna have to find a different route all told um things might be falling apart a little bit yeah am as episode one done however if you want to watch the next one and see what we both get up to in Europe all you've got to do is subscribe to nebula the next episode is up right now on nebula in fact every episode of jet lag the game goes out one week early on nebula and that's great because it's really easy to sign up there's also plenty of reason to subscribe to nebula for more than just chat lag there's Wendover on there there's half as interesting on there there's so many great other channels that we know you already watched and a lot of these channels have made law inform Originals with big budgets some of the best stuff they ever made ourselves included we've done plenty of Originals over on Wendover and Hai what makes nebula even better is the best way to subscribe to it it's actually cheaper to subscribe through curiosity stream because they run this bundle

        "transcript": "right now we're racing to circumnavigate the world both teams started in denver with 1 000 and we earn more money by doing challenges we're one day in so if you haven't watched episode one there are about to be some spoilers me and joseph just took off from cancun amsterdam meaning we're going to be the first team to arrive in europe ben and adam are in new york about to board a flight to milan the route from milan to thailand just fell apart due to delays so they're boarding their flight to italy with no plan at all all right well our thailand passes got approved moments after our thailand plan fell apart incredible we're really confused about what sam and joseph are up to i mean it's been like 12 hours no challenges they haven't completed any challenges before so it's hopefully cut to them doing some really huge challenge right now [Music] all right our microphone like word right so if we sound worse that's why sorry absolutely massive update i i don't know how he didn't see this place um there is a 1 50 pm direct from milan to singapore 696 dollars that's a lot of money a lot of money but it's but we would have you know four hours to try to earn it and if we can earn that money this is an amazing [Music] [Music] all right we finally made out of customs yeah it took a really nice close look at joseph's package i have a brand new passport that only has one stamp on it from mexico from yesterday so which looks a little it's a little sauce okay so now we need to decide what we're doing i mean definitely go do a challenge i feel like the museum one would be pretty easy either that one or the top five attraction one that's pretty high value and i looked it's like the reich's museum the van gogh museum which right now they're all pretty close yeah i mean i don't know is that how much is that worth that one's worth like i think like 900 bucks oh wow let's just do that pretty high value one that hasn't been done yet again if it's all if they're all like right next to each other we need to snipe that before they get the get it in milan let's uh let's get a train to the city though all right let's do it yeah oh yeah because i want to use public transport only i think yeah we [Music] welcome to italy mamma mia [Music] while we're on the plane we looked at a ton of options we had all these different plans we you know we originally wanted to go paris to bangkok but then we missed the paris flight we actually got in after it even left then we were thinking we would go to london and then singapore but then we realized we were idiots and there's a direct flight from milan to singapore at 1 50 pm we just need to earn a ton of money yeah that's the problem we have to earn a lot of money and so the best way to do that is going to be by building a go-kart [Music] we we put the go-kart challenge on there like last minute sort of as a joke we did not think anyone was gonna do it we did a ton of research on the plane we've looked at like yeah every single hardware store near the airport i found one that sells wheels i've done so much research about wheels i now know the italian word for wheels it's round dough no that can't be right i don't know the italian word for wheels but we're going to brico center and we're going to attempt to buy everything we need to build a go-kart we've got some caffeine so it looks like we have to visit the reichs museum the vondel park the anne frank museum the van gogh museum yeah and the anne frank easier sorry not the vancouver thing the the jordan which is right next to the that's all yeah those are all right here yes the jordan and the anne frank museum are right next to each other and then the three others [Music] all right baby we are at the brico center everyone's favorite reason to come to italy we need wheels something like this would be good that's enough to ride on i've got a whole wheel section here those red ones are pretty sick huh let's go bigger okay now we're gonna need screws to screw that onto there stick up through the wood a little bit it's fine boy i sure hope they're not doing this right now [Music] we've made it to the anne frank house famous for being the house of anne frank yep that's right is it not actually in her house i don't know they've updated it i feel like you're not supposed to renovate history historic landmarks all right let me do some googling here we go [Music] all right now now we need to find the jordan which i think is really just this neighborhood so let's go down there and turn right okay so attraction one out of five done we got to make pace because i think there's a good chance that ben and adam are trying to did you sit in that [Music] look [Music] you ready to build a go-kart buddy yeah but where what a great question pick up the pace joseph so i'm gonna be honest i have no idea what the jordan is or why it's an attraction i don't either it's like a neighborhood i guess and it looks nice but it kind of also just looks like the rest of amsterdam the sign says jordan therefore we're in jordan just if you're like purposely pushing your chin logistic force that's that's that's when wendover gets its own private army we're gonna call it the logistic force it's looking for tram 19. 19. it leaves like now o'clock everything comes down to this epic movement i think music starts now there's one trail this one tram we don't make this tram we give up right now right yeah we're going to get into a nice hotel and sleep we made our tram we demanded it i guess we have to keep trying all right we have about what like an hour and a half max to build a go-cart we're gonna go quick stiamo construendo go-kart [Music] either this is going to be an epic sequence of competing the finishes that the saint paul ben and adam are doing this we're going to look like idiots yeah either way [Music] here's the rex museum three two one smile [Music] okay we got it got that one all right uh then go museum that's that right it rolls it looks very dangerous oh it's very dangerous [Music] [Music] man look at how intermodal this street is keep walking are you stopping no i'm not i'm talking i'm walking and talking all right [Music] all right joseph what's what's your prediction that ben and adam are up to right now [Music] we call it the mamma mia there's an italian man right there adam don't be insensitive that's not inceptive i just have to find somewhere to ride this thing let's go let's should go visit the us consulate yeah let's go do it yeah let's make some money you know remember for our second challenges in the city we only get half of the value yeah we're right now we're right there so we may as well let's go don't use your phone on the internet to look up where your local conflict is luckily if i remember correctly and i'm pretty sure i do we are within walking distance yeah um i'm pretty sure it's right on that square sam's kind of cheating though because he's been here before i know where things are i mean it's kind of perfect we're not gonna get a better incline than that i mean this is actively dangerous oh it's super dangerous would you like me to do it i don't know what do you think i mean you got really stuff on the last one you okay you got it should we get some elevation look for flags all right looking for american flags i don't see any all right so it has to go down the incline without falling apart that's the key oh god [Music] i did it it did fall apart not the important part i don't know in fact does that count yeah it counts seat hurts so much [Music] here we go [Music] incredible all right now that we got it all right well that building has a whole lot of security cameras oh here we go let's [Music] all right should we sit down somewhere and strategize because there's a bench over there should we go to the bench yeah let's do it we really have not talked much about what we're doing after this point because i don't really know what we're doing after this point yes like legitimately easier right which country we're going yeah actually i don't know where we're gonna go next yeah exposed screws you gotta hurry [Music] it's pretty tall ciao all right we checked the prices have it changed let's check the prices 6.98 we need ten dollars we're ten dollars short so we can just have to do any challenge okay let's decide on one really quick find a flight that goes from amsterdam to budapest at 125 which is in two hours from now 190 each so we can do that and then there's a flight that leaves at 11 30 p.m that goes from budapest to dubai for only 240 dollars if we do it it gives us enough time in budapest to complete a challenge and then get on the flight to dubai i mean it gets into buy one it gets at 7 30 a.m tomorrow in dubai 8 pm and then and then the rest period doesn't start to like 3 p.m okay so we haven't mentioned this yet but so that nobody dies the game gets pause for a 20-hour rest period after the first 48 hours that means we need to be on the ground and in a hotel at 3 p.m dubai time yeah so hypothetically vessel gives us some time to leave from dubai or do a challenge in dubai yeah i mean it sounds sounds like a good option and it sounds like the best option we have now we might have to do it we might just have to do it because like if we're gonna do it we have to do it now okay let's do it okay okay so we need literally 10 more dollars to book the flight to singapore so we can any challenge we just got to get it done before our flight leave we could go get drunk on a local liquor we could go do we could go do a piggyback ride around a local park we could go try and find a regional exclusive mcdonald's item we could try and buy a hat that's worth more than a hundred dollars there are lots of clothing boutiques around here but if we decide on that we're locked in that's true we're locked in i think we should look look for local parks yeah let's look for a park first and then let's decide all right we just called an uber and i guess i'm gonna book that flight while we're in the uber since it leaves in like exactly two hours at least exactly two hours from now oh no what uh he can't book within two hours and literally three minutes ago they came within you go away oh my god the worst timing wow so we're literally three minutes late okay we're getting an uber two parco mameli [Music] i'm super excited to carry adam around the park well this is beautiful so for this challenge we have to give each other piggy backs around the perimeter of a local park we're here at parco mameli we don't have a lot of time so we're going to go as fast as possible we're allowed to switch off at any point we just have to get all the way around all right we got it we got it we got it we're doing great i've not seen a lot of good options into dubai i mean we could trade doha yeah but i don't like doha has a budget airline like by dubai it doesn't really uh man i feel like stuck like this this is where planning would have been really useful yeah i know ben and adam definitely had the advantage oh easy this is easy oh you're doing so good all right thank you thank you thank you all right here switch we [Music] should i keep recording this park is beautiful it's really lovely it's a lovely day in italy we haven't slept in so long oh my god are you done yeah all right two three ah we're not going spectacularly we just can't find a good route and we're really burning time while we're doing it so like it's stressful in a lot of different ways yeah right now we're just trying to find good wi-fi there are our bags almost there uh okay you want to say gosh okay [Music] money in the bank great work buddy let's get to the airport hey sam thinks he's finally found something tonight out of amsterdam at 9 25 p.m there is a non-stop flight to singapore that would cost 1 604 total between the two of us that's a lot the rest period um ends at 3 p.m in singapore time on sunday sorry i have tons of tabs 25 a.m on monday from singapore there is a non-stop flight into seoul which is a country that we can transit through that is 629 totally from seoul there is a 240 flight to lax it costs 2 200 for the two of us i think this is our best shot it would just require really grinding with the challenges because i mean in order to leave tonight if we were to do that and prices could change at any moment you need to earn 998.11 in the next eight hours great work you did it thank you five minutes away we're gonna make it eight hours or nine hundred dollars i think that's doable all right i think we have no other choice i mean i just don't see a better option all right let's do it we have to we have no choice so gotta fly to singapore tonight yeah let's just start grinding in amsterdam and fly straight to singapore tonight enrico is right around the corner we're going to singapore baby i cannot wait for you guys to see what happens

        "transcript": "we're racing to circumnavigate the world in under 100 hours this is episode three and we're 23 hours in so spoilers ahead right now me and my partner joseph from real life lore are stuck in amsterdam we have a plan to take a flight to singapore in eight hours but first we need to earn a ton of money by doing challenges from this list the other team adam and ben are in busto arcizio italy and just earned enough money to take a flight to singapore the only trouble is that flight starts boarding in an hour i mean if if we book it and we can't get on it if there's some rule there's anything okay we're out of money okay we've done two challenges here okay okay we'll book it at the airport [Music] let's do it buddy all right we gotta find the singapore air gate whatever thing asap because i don't know when they're gonna stop booking this flight please please please please can i buy two tickets to the 150 non-stop to singapore the flight uh the flight is uh you have to go to the tickets encounter this is not a ticket oh where's the ticket encounter it's been a bad idea eight hours or nine hundred dollars i think that's doable if we can't get that budget now to get the onward flight to seoul we could book a flight that we couldn't take as a backup depaul i'm poor for nothing we go touch up there's a bird right there [Music] don't scare the bird here birdie birdie nope nope we need to have like some clothes i've got free snacks oh no look fruit snack get the first snack i think we have to study bird behavior where are these birds landing and then we gotta like get to where they're landing before they land just want to say hi you have bread well like pretzels this is this is a slow game bird yes yes look there's a better one here it's a better one there oh can we buy two tickets on the 150 singapore air flight direct to singapore i'm so unbelievably sweaty thank god okay we're through security we're about to order flight to singapore i don't know where sam and joseph are but they are hosts yeah they're they're in trouble the boys are in trouble not these boys not these no no not these boys uh these boys are about to be in singapore 12 hours before the rest period starts i'd be pretty shocked if the other boys had pulled that off no bird god damn it bird wasn't this difficult i almost got it getting all outsmarted by bird this bird's fast look at that look at that speed come on my guy should i go for it oh me these damn stuck-up aristocratic birds is there like a place in amsterdam we can go that just has like a bird we can touch like a pet store you know i feel like we should just take the running at bird strategy just like went right up to these people [Music] got it i got it did you get it i got it [Music] this took like 40 minutes jesus christ okay let's let's do something else fine thank you [Music] it could have been us oh we do get extra leg room we got a gaming we have a weird little gaming console the estimated flight time is zero minutes so we're gonna get in extra early [Music] all right well i've touched a burn hence the hand sanitizer and for all of that we only earned 75 bucks it's longer than expected um so we're a seven minute walk to a casino because it would be a one quarter one we would get a seven uh sorry a 50 gambling budget but i guess we should just do that while we're here [Music] i really did not expect to be spending all day in amsterdam yeah neither did i here we go holland casino i'll see you five minute long it's really nice being in walkable cities we should maybe think about that for other countries all right let's go in casinos don't really like filming so our gaming footage kind of sucks but i'm just gonna tell you what happened we played roulette and we just kept betting on 17 black and odd and we kept winning you don't have to know what that means you'll just get it from reactions money big money big our okay oh nice [Music] oh my god oh my god look at that okay well uh we just won almost four hundred dollars our luck just changed very fast i was feeling i was feeling like so unlucky i mean it wasn't even unlucky it was just like we did a bad job yeah for man all right let's do the math and see if we have enough to book our flight yeah so i think we might now which i was not expecting to have this quickly one six one four we have enough all right let's book it should we book the flight singapore yeah let's do it man this was easy yeah i think we can gamble the rest of our budget are we allowed to no the rules didn't explicitly say we couldn't okay so i'm booking this flight but then it's it's not like we can just do nothing for the rest of the day because ideally we want to book that flight right after our rest period ends to seoul which i believe was like 670 bucks so that's that's a good amount of challenges of the kind of one-quarter value that we uh have right now so we're still gonna have to grind for the rest of the day to try to book that one so just to recap most countries especially countries like singapore won't let you in unless you've booked proof of armor travel so before we leave for singapore we need to spend the day in amsterdam earning enough money to get this flight from singapore to seoul then we want to take this super expensive flight from seoul to lax the good news is we have a plan we'll land in singapore with just enough time to earn twelve hundred dollars by bungee jumping at a place called sky park sentosa if we can pull all this off we're pretty sure we'll win the game yes our first order of attention is we're gonna go to mcdonald's because uh first of all food second of all we can get 50 bucks out of the original 200 by eating a menu item that is not available in the united states and there is one here which we will show you shortly [Music] all right so we're very comes from the fact that sam and joseph of gravley been doing a lot of stuff while we've been in the air and we need some way you know we need some content that we can cut back to us more to kind of break that up and remind you that there are two teams in the show so ben do something [Music] well the chili chicken yeah that's that's unique i think welcome to our special dutch mcdonald's muffin special menu item number one chocolate milk full menu item number two that we're pretty certain on is the veggie patty honey crispy chicken but not actually chicken honey say much yeah it looks like this special menu item number three freak sauce crazy which i think looks delicious yeah that's definitely i've never seen fruit sauce before i don't know if i like that color no hair down some chocolate milk oh yeah and i'll have some fruit sauce and then we'll have completed yum all right [Music] all right and some fruit sauce actually it's quite good i like it it's pretty good yeah it's basically just like yoo-hoo but so nobody can argue that that's that you can get the choco milk in the u.s you're the time lapse of us eating you gotta eat handsomely the lunch on singapore air is actually very nice pretty good not so bad they gave us ice cream sean jinxer that was prozac by the way say medicated kids although don't don't do this this was a terrible idea oh my god about a fountain [Music] okay said a fountain yeah and then what do you refer to this as i refer to this as a water like a drink you found it yeah so they didn't specify this type of fountain even though this might be what we're thinking about right so i think under the rules a drinking fountain like this would be a legend great a distraction distractions well we know there's another fountain right over there which is not an eyesight you're wasting valuable water that is a full cup guys it was a full cup i don't think i should be the one carrying this because i have like very fidgety hands fine well then you have to film well that's also bad for filming but all right transfer too all right that's right and adam are gonna probably complain about this and like put stuff up in the edit because they're gonna be sore losers when they end up losing the end adam what have you learned about yourself during this flight i've learned that i really don't want to watch the show ozark i downloaded the whole first season i ran out of other things and instead of watching it i just went to sleep it was back this way all right uh we gotta cross here [Music] you're welcome fountain [Music] think joseph about what canada goose it's very expensive isn't it yeah what do they have right there i don't know some hats should we check out canada i catch what you're laying down check out what kind of hats canada yeah let's let's go check it out yeah okay you want this one this one's 150 euros which would be in budget [Music] all right that was an easy 100 100 bucks what was that how much do we spend like 170 we spent 150 bucks well euros so like 160 us dollar to make a hundred dollars to make 100 of course like the what we spend does not come out of our budget efficiency it comes out of the production budget yeah and it comes out of my bank account your problems though it is worth considering like this will make our lives more difficult in singapore in terms of like doing the challenges we need to get the budget going we're not going to have very many challenges left by the time we get to singapore but on the other hand it's gonna make their lives difficult even earlier yes they're gonna get off their flight and they're all of a sudden gonna have like two-thirds of the i'm probably gonna get a nasty text message from adam saying you're breaking the game sam and yes i may be breaking the game but strategically so strategically breaking [Music] here's a here's a fun little illustration in the security card the plane's about to crash and all the people are ducking but there's one baby just sitting normally no idea something's going wrong i don't think there's much topography to reach to ascend 500 feet it doesn't actually say that you have to do 500 feet like all at once like climb a 500 foot mountain it just sends you need to ascend 500 feet to a high point without touching pavement but like if we just found like a 10 foot mound and did it 50 times just ran up and down it 50 times yeah i mean there is that big mound that was backed by um oh yeah by uh the rice the rice museum should we do that yeah [Music] all right measuring up says 18 feet 10 inches so we need to do 28 climbs yep [Music] thirty [Music] [Music] yes [Music] what was that 150 bucks yeah 150 bucks wow easy easy [Music] the food is coming i'm so hungry if they didn't feed us on these flights we would have been dead by now the only food i've eaten has been four doughnuts and then two airplane meals and you lost most of them that's so true yeah so breakfast is like a it's like a seafood noodle dish breakfast is a uh cultural construct [Music] kids now i have 482.93 not too bad not too bad let me check how much we need to book that flight on the second board yeah we need 175. okay so we need 700 without the quarter pick up three pound trash 550 that's pretty easy that's a pretty easy one i mean i would say do that and then do a parkour video yeah i mean i i think i agree at this point uh let's say we know we can finish let's pick up some trash yeah i mean we did not i swear we did not plant this i feel like that's a good pound right there look at this game is 1.4 we're halfway there already this is kind of heineken that's what i didn't left today oh great 1.7 oh no what do we got only two pounds [Music] oh wow it's the mother lode [Music] there we go what's that somehow we got all the way up to four [Music] that's my good deed for the internet for the day i'd say so my hands are supposed to go the aftermath of all that trash that's enough i think that's enough it feels so gross it might not be though it's got it [Music] uh do you think we should like follow the canal and find trick spots there or like go to the park or what [Music] go go go go [Music] you know keep going [Music] keep going keep going keep going keep that was so extreme all right so i edited together our parkour video we fulfilled the requirements we have the the music i found some old stock music left my computer we have the transitions we have everything i'll probably touch it a little bit more before you see it but you don't even know that so here it is i want you to jump from there to there come on come on we're gonna do it quickly our core is not slow keep going keep going keep going nice job you got it keep going keep going go go go go go how do you dodge all those cars yeah you made it that was so extreme oh my god please he's keeping going he's still going it's probably enough or you can keep going i guess you can keep going that's fine that is extreme parkour ladies and gentlemen all right with that parkour we earned um we earned another 75 bucks or one quarter of 300 bucks so our total is 695.43 which means we have enough to book our onward flight to seoul just in the next time because we're about to get over to the airport um and we need our onward flight before we can check in so i'm going to book that on the way let me get there [Music] joseph you're ready for ben yes [Music] thank you very much do you remember when i woke you up or was i just i remember but then i like literally i remember you woke me up and then i just like my consciousness just faded right back out well a little tired you know circumnavigating the world [Music] but how long 36 hours here's the problem when you're on a 12-hour flight you'd think you would sleep for most of it but in new york the hours that we were on the flight are what like 7 a.m to 7 p.m right like prime awake hours yeah really perfect uh foresight by us okay we finally made it that was almost two hours of check-in security and immigration literally two hours of bureaucracy really glad we came here early and we're not even done yet now we have to go to another document check not complaining very grateful to travel but man is it a lot of work during coven [Music] gotta get the shots [Music] thank you [Music] oh it's hot it's gonna be so hot outside oh god [Music] hello welcome to singapore it's very bright and very hot but it's very pretty i mean take a look really lovely here by the airport um so we did the math on the flight and we're pretty sure we have exactly one dollar and 26 cents left and we don't have a plan we don't know where we're going from here i don't think that we can really get much further before the rest period uh but we're going to look into it probably need to go to australia we're not going to hit the distance requirement but we can't get to australia before the rest period we should check bali they only have forts jakarta georgetown fanoi bangkok who had hot yacht we could justify going somewhere else because we could earn more money but then we would also have to spend more money to get there so unless we could get somewhere really cheaply it doesn't really make sense for us to leave singapore i need a shower so badly yeah so how much money do we need 791 to get to sydney but then we're gonna need to build onward travel from city so we need basically just twelve hundred dollars well we could knock that out with just money jumping can we go bungee jumping here absolutely yeah all right this place opens a little afternoon sky park santosa the good news is we have a plan we'll land in singapore with just enough time to earn twelve hundred dollars by bungee jumping at a place called sky park santosa bungee jumping at a place called sky park santosa sky park sentosa this place opens a little afternoon sky park synthosa we have looked at all the options and it turns out that we actually can't get anywhere that would make sense to go to so we're just saying it in singapore for a while we're gonna go try to go bungee jumping so we can make a lot of money and there's a lot of bungee jumping options here and that will be funny probably so we're very excited to see you there we have no idea what's happening we're just getting on the train let's get on this train should we i don't know [Music] [Music] do you just do just one madam two sews of bruce willis that's all you need we uh we got changed adam had a shower i didn't i should have but i got a little drink and uh we're headed to our bungee jumping appointment at this horrible device in front of us which is so much taller than it looked in the pictures uh so see it's gonna be great [Music] we've got our tickets we're about to go up they said no loose items but we bought a thing that's gonna like strap a gopro to us so cut to us being really scared now you're forwarding

        "transcript": "welcome back to circumnavigation we're about 42 hours in and here's the state of the game right now me and my teammate joseph from real life lore are on a flight to singapore with our ticket to seoul already booked the problem is we only have 20 and we need to make enough money to take a super expensive flight from seoul to the us before we can get on our flight to seoul our plan once we land is to earn 1200 bucks by bungee jumping in singapore during the few hours we'll have before the game's mandatory rest period begins unfortunately for us ben and adam had the same idea [Music] all right hands up to the side right now are you good here we go buddy this is it look forward in point all right everybody five four three two five four three two one oh [Music] that woke me up in case anyone was wondering bungee jumping is way scarier than it looks being scary i thought i thought it was gonna be very scary and it was five times scarier than i expected money in the bank oh my god that is the most deserved twelve hundred dollars we've ever gotten yeah oh [Music] okay we've made it to singapore yep we're back which is the good news the bad news is you saw the text right yeah okay so the bad news is that adam and ben completed the bungee chummy challenge and that was kind of our whole ploy so i don't know what else can we do before the rest period i don't know i mean i i looked and like everything like the two other big ones universal and people yeah there's no way we could do that they both require reservations they stopped doing challenges around like 11 or 12 a.m central european time there was a 1 pm flight to singapore from milan where we think they were so you think there's maybe a good possibility that they're here with us or will be here with us for the rest of the year there's also very few cities where you can bungee jump yeah like that easily so you think they may have done literally what we were going to do i think there's a very real chance they're here which means like the challenges that are easy for us are going to be easy for them we could definitely earn some more money hey those people are kayaking oh oh i think we're kayaking we're going to see if we can figure out where that person got that kayak [Music] all right here we go let's do it [Music] so we have to go one mile easy yeah honestly not having that bungee jump one that makes me pretty nervous uh that makes me really nervous about being able to get out of here we're definitely gonna be able to get to soul stones we have the flights to seoul but then we need something else i know getting out of seoul is the the hard part we're starting to think is like what we learned in amsterdam is planning really counts here yeah not allowed to plan or research or anything during our rest period yeah so maybe the best use of the next two hours rather than scrambling and failing he's like meticulously planning what we do after the rest period okay i i agree all right well totally i guess uh i guess we're gonna uh head to our hotel and do some plotting do some plotting and some rest yes finally i got almost 48 hours of being on the move continuously you know you're sitting at a computer and you're writing challenges and you're like it can't be that hard to kayak a mile but then you're in the kayak in singapore it turns out it's harder than you thought it would be i remember this exact conversation i remember we said how how far should it be a mile yeah sure all right and then we never talked about it again [Music] that sure is a lot of water falling big fountains getting a taxi slash uber is taking forever so it makes me think we made the right call in terms of not rushing to try to do something it feels like we should like sing a song like a sailing song yeah do you know any sailing songs i don't know do we know any sailings uh what's like what's like row row row your boat gently down the stream i don't remember this i can have that song row row row your boat gently down the stream merrily merrily merrily's got the maryland i don't know the words yet there are there's two there's two lines in the song is there not more to the song no [Music] all right that is a mile on water under human power that is uh what 350 for us in the bank let's go all right we made it to our hotel yeah this is the last you'll hear from us for 20 hours we're exhausted we're going to be very excited to go do nothing for 20 hours hell yeah how you doing buddy so sleepy [Music] okay we just arrived at the hotel the great period is starting i've never been more excited to take a shower my entire life it's uh it's truly the most wonderful time of the year okay so for the next 20 hours the game is paused that means no forward progress no challenges and no strategy talk all we're supposed to do is get a relaxing night of sleep in an actual bed it's about 4am and i've just awoken from a nightmare where sam and joseph beat us in the race before we could even get to australia so hopefully that won't happen in real life it is 4 a.m i've been trying to get back to sleep for like an hour or two now failed completely so i decided to wander the streets towards a 24-hour coffee shop and explore singapore at it coolest it is ever in the day it is 84 degrees out it's humid it is hot and it's 4am this is unbelievable i don't know how people live here and i especially don't know how we're gonna run through the streets completing challenges tomorrow this view really tells you what singapore's economy is all about see uh bank bank bank bank bank bank bank bank bank not bank bank and then a fancy hotel all right we're having some uh dim sum for breakfast happy breakfast adam morning good morning it's a mixture of uh pastries and i guess pastries what round of food is this joseph it's only number two so it's still the rest period but the hotel kicked us out at one the game restarts at 3. just walking around to seeing the sights we're at the big the the only thing that i knew about singapore before coming here is the thing we're going to go see you have anything funny to say ben [Music] no i just think those are really cool anything funny to say about this no but i have a fun singapore fact okay you know that it's illegal to eat a durian fruit on the subway here it's not relevant to this i just thought of it i thought that was interesting perfect content ben yeah it is two minutes to three we're almost back at it now comes the stage in the game where for some stupid reason i actually feel genuinely like physically nervous to complete a completely arbitrary game that we just made up the rules for i also feel really nervous i am i don't know why which is stupid yeah why would we feel nervous i feel so much anxiety in my stomach just about making it uh making it back and making it back on time is super nerve-wracking yeah well the thing is beeping that's great that indicates that it's the game is back on the first thing we need to do is book our flight to australia then we also need to book our onward flight from australia so we're booking a flight to fiji because it's not that expensive we also have a ton of like administrative stuff we have to do we have to get our australia e-visas approved we have to get travel insurance for fiji um and then once we get to australia we have to have coveted tests ready to take before we leave here we have what like four hours until the flight we're planning on taking to australia yeah so we are going to do another challenge we are going to eat at a michelin-starred restaurant it's a very pleasant challenge um doesn't get us a lot of money it does we want to do it and so we're going to do it oh oh it's three oh it's three years forget my response okay i think we need to consider what ben and adam are doing i'm now even more confident that ben and adam are here in singapore because i looked at the time that they sent the message yeah saying that they completed bungee jumping yeah it was 1 30 p.m singapore time which seems strange because the flight that we thought they were on arrived from milan at like 7 or 8 a.m but the bungee jumping place here the only bungee jumping place in singapore opens at 12 30 p.m i'm super sure they're here which means they're very far along and unfortunately i did the back with the napkin math and i believe that they have around 2 000 in the bank right now that's so much more than us that is because we're broke we have like 25 bucks or something so we either have to find one that we can get a reservation at or we have to find a place that's more casual oh look there's one that says street street food what's that one it is open okay that's good okay it's like two miles away we're going to hill street taiwan pork noodle which has one we gotta go stop explaining things we're going yeah so how screwed are we right now a little bit so i think we need to be looking for the hail mary option let me explain why we're in such a pickle right now we've basically got three options one we take our already book flight to seoul problem is it gets us out of singapore quite late and after looking closely the connections to the us are at bad times and have gotten even more expensive i'm pretty sure if we do this we'll lose two we go somewhere nearby that's not sold the two with flights to the us are tokyo and sydney trouble is by the time we'd earned the money to get an expensive flight to sydney it would be late and we'd definitely be behind and tokyo is only open for transit so we couldn't leave the airport to do challenges either way i'm pretty sure we lose which leaves option three go big risk everything to get an extremely expensive direct flight from singapore to san francisco it would mean we'd almost definitely win but the only way to afford that flight is well you'll see i believe the hail mary option is to make some money bring it to the casino and gamble it did a bunch of research but unfortunately i learned more about the challenges we cannot do than the challenges we can do well to start with we can't do the rollercoaster wine universal studios singapore but it's sold out paintball um there's only like one or two places and they both require super advanced booking so uh there's the eat a meal to michelin star restaurant singapore is famous for having like hawker stands like street street stalls that are michelin star and just by chance when joseph and i were on a walk earlier we stumbled across a pond of fish yeah like tons of tiny fish that we could very easily catch there's that challenge to catch a fish and i'm sure they actually know it specifically says that we can catch it by hand yeah we can okay this is the bus we need to get on so that stop is down there so we're going to race it down this street okay so let's find a michelin star hawker stand head there and then if that goes super quick i think we could still have time to go catch the fish if we can get just enough if we can win just enough to get that flight yeah so we should calculate our bets to get exactly what we need if we win but if we win it's so epic that's the whole i know that's the most incredible story and ben and adam will be so pissed all right you might notice that this is not in fact a michelin star restaurant and that's because on the right we noticed that we messed up a bit the catch of fish challenge is actually worth 800 which was a lot more than we thought it was right initially and we think we can do that super quickly so we got to do that first i figured that we can turn this into a net just by poking a few holes in there just tiny tiny tiny little bit of pressure it's a big one i know all right that is kind of big unfortunately here first of all we need to not get caught because i know this what if we went on the far side this seems highly illegal okay there's no security cameras around right oh except for that one right there all right as we've been walking i have booked our flight to australia we're gonna explain why we're going to australia once we get our food this is not that bad of a line at all about to just get destroyed by this thunderstorm [Music] i feel like they can swim here but the turtles are coming oh no that's not my foot my foot is much harder than we thought you're too smart i like the pigeons i hate when the challenges are challenging they they say there's plenty of fish in the scene well this is a uh there's not a c sam okay here's what we'll do all stand in that one spot with the bag sitting very still you grab some small rocks to scare the fish okay [Music] that's my feeling [Music] oh someone's coming okay so we just found out that place is cash only so i am running to the nearest atm to try and get cash in time we wandered off for a second and that family picked up our bag yeah they came back and picked her bag up they must have thought it was in there yeah was like props to them so now we don't now we're backless because i think that guy's just throwing the bag away yeah i think you're almost an hour yeah and that family is still there we should probably just go and try and do the michelin star restaurant in the qrikets worry about the mission star taking one yeah but i mean what other choices do we have at this point [Music] hello to the audience we got two dishes um give me your glasses i can make what they're called all right one of the ghost tank that's this one and this one is a like a gan mine so one thing that's interesting is this is one of only two restaurants in the entire world that has a michelin star and sells like street food and the other one is in hong kong and this is very good i'm very lucky so while we eat let's explain why we're going to australia yeah so you might be wondering why are we going to japan why aren't we going to seoul if we went for japan or seoul we would not meet the distance we'd have to go through australia to reach the distance that the traffic of cancer distance that we need to reach in order to officially circumnavigate all right we have finished our michelin star meal and our car is nearly here take us to the airport it is also starting to rain and it's just thank you very much okay it's somewhere in here okay i think we've got to look for the big one just got word i just ate in a michelin starcraft so we were literally just literally in line are they here you think i don't know i mean this is like the classic michelin walker stall let's see if we can find him [Music] all right you're really limping there buddy boy my feet are messed up i don't see them but that is so frustrating we literally just keep hitting l i know we were like three spaces away from getting the mission server and if we went here first instead of trying to catch the damn fish i bet they didn't even need it i bet they just like had some dinner i cannot believe how many else we're getting oh i feel like we should just do something super easy like get drunk and then just like yolo our money we can you know make the money with your tradition so i think honestly the best bet is just to get drunk on local liquor have a good time at the casino and if we lose at least we're drunk for drunk and then just yolo it all in the casino have a good time while we're doing it for two hours in the casino i think that works okay should we get a if we get a car to the um to the casino in the marina bay sands there's gotta be a bar in the raid base yeah after a lot of bureaucratic red tape we got our tickets and we are headed to australia for some reason our gate always has to be the one that is like the furthest possible away that's where they keep the good ones that's where they keep the good ones like sydney i want to walk fast we have maybe 30 minutes left to have any chance of catching that flight tonight and and i have like a completely empty stomach and i think you said you did too i haven't eaten anything since for breakfast this is not going to be very coherent okay so we're going to be blasted drunk and then go to the casino with only 300. and we have to win 2 grand what could possibly go wrong nothing a regular evening ladies and gentlemen just to put you in the picture of what's happening with the aircraft obviously you can see what's possibly what's happening out there the engineers are looking at the aircraft at the moment the aircraft was struck by lightning when it came into singapore some of you were on the aircraft and probably experienced that down the left-hand side there is superficial damage to the aircraft unfortunately they've done the inspections but they have got quite considerable inspections to do a lot of you've had very long days and it's still a long night ahead of us [Music] that is not good but you know what is good the fact that i've already planned out your entire night of entertainment of course you're gonna start by watching the season finale of jet lag it all comes to an end and you can watch that episode right now if you're a nebula subscriber that's of course to thank the fact that our nebu subscribers are quite literally the

recommend watching that but the good news is that if you're not already a subscriber it's pretty easy to sign up and get access to every single episode of jet lag one week early the best way to get

        "transcript": "we're 52 hours into our race around the world if you want to know what happened in those 52 hours we made a whole bunch of videos about it so go watch those right now both teams are in Singapore me and Joseph only have 20 and in order to beat Ben and Adam we need to get on a super extensive flight directly to the US by the end of tonight in order to make that money our plan is to do the get drunk on a local liquor Challenge and gamble that reward money at a casino until we have enough to buy the plane tickets Ben and Adam have to take the long route back to America through Australia because they have a lot of distance make up to meet the distance requirements they were about to board an overnight flight to Sydney but well you'll see what happened with that a very good evening ladies and gentlemen just to put you in the picture of what's happening with the aircraft at obviously you can see what's possibly what's happening out there the aircraft was struck by lightning when it came into Singapore there is superficial damage to the aircraft unfortunately they've done the inspections but they have got quite considerable inspections to do a lot of the event very long days and there's still a long night ahead of us that is not good it was struck by lightning that's exciting content though lightning we got lightning on this show oh my God pretty cool huh you have a new Lounge up there's this freaking Avenue Lounge it said up saying we're running another time that casino sign said did sign said up where is it said this way oh my god do you think Starbucks has a liquor is anywhere down there have alcohol it doesn't look like there's any help now it just looks like normal food court yeah I don't understand it do you think the Ferrari store has alcohol do you think they allow public drinking here can we just go to a liquor store in the bottle we're not risking Singapore yeah there's police everywhere in here it literally pops all over the place in here I don't really fancy getting arrested okay so this delay is kind of a big problem for us we are open and we can take a 10 15 direct flight from Sydney to LAX we already have a flight Fiji book that's later but yeah if we can get direct to La we save like seven hours I think five hours yeah do you just have a bar or yes or a burger could be committed okay no worries 4L l City where they they said they were sold out right they said they are fully commanded they're fully booked what about this Mach 32 place I guess we could try yeah we go to the bar um okay that's fine no worries so uh departure at the moment they are publishing as 2200 hours which is at 10 pm when they say um departure's at 10 now oh dear that's not good I want you are you sitting at the bar yeah do you have any uh do you have any liquor made in Singapore local liquor nope another Singapore liquor at all they do have brewed but it tastes like if you haven't heard of island island brand oh yeah yeah we don't have it here no no no no no they don't have any local liquor there's no local Singaporean well apparently there's one but it tastes like yeah they've just got the new information from the engineers you need more time to do the checks on the aircraft provisional departure time from here is now at 11 o'clock local timing did you hear that another delay another hour we're really gonna have to start thinking about backup option that this one falls through but the flight to um Darwin 10 45. there's an 11 P.M to Adelaide there's a 2 A.M Singapore to Sydney oh you know what I would argue that I started having fun when did you start having fun I've been having fun honestly since pretty much all day today well I think officially I started having fun when we started looking for alcohol I really I really enjoy looking for alcohol so I think we started having fun at 5 30. it was only 20 minutes ago yeah yeah but like we had an actively have fun okay that's true we're gonna have some alcohol that's funny yeah which is fun and not a challenge yeah and then gamble whatever's left so we can get 300 something having a good time yeah all right and then Camp YOLO all that yeah we either go big or go home except in this case not go home yeah in this case we're stranded yeah go big or stay here and go big or stay stay tracked ladies and gentlemen thank you for waiting we finally have the good news we are going to start voting now at this stage we'd like to invite our priority customers in group one two and three to proceed in for morning so now I think we are gonna at least have enough time to make that that flight to Fiji yeah we should foreign [Music] just a wild guess but at this point of the game Sam and Joseph should be headed either to Australia or to Tokyo so maybe Soul maybe soul relax machine up to 25 bucks so what do you think 17 each time yeah so just five dollars each time on the last 17. yeah I think so okay so they have a real roulette thing up there oh and so we're all watching [Music] let's go [Music] oh my God oh my God we just got it oh my God you see that no way I told you this is a Flawless strategy Flawless strategy everything on it I should have what do we have now so wait so we have where's our money it should be five times thirty two it says we only have 50. we started with 50. yeah and I don't what is there a minimum that we're not meeting oh Min bet 25. oh no that is devastating we wouldn't want 800 I know we wouldn't know if we had non-stop elves if we put the minimum 25 on black there we would have won 800 non-stop Bells I can't that was almost enough all right we gotta try to double our money on black now foreign [Music] there's no way we don't take another hour right now first time we got the number back right it literally was that didn't even tell us okay so now we have 75 so we're getting another 25 on black 25 up all right come on let's get another black nope well we're just backwards well we have uh 25 left should we put it on black again yeah okay we got 25. what do you think black again or should we just go into the numbers let's keep doing black but we could put on 17 twice or 25 on 17. okay that is not 17. that's the black 33. I think we should do something again go big or go home we're not gonna make any progress all right we go bigger we get stranded well we are officially broke but we're having a good size too foreign test [Music] I'm leaning fish at the moment if you can find a place to rent one if there's a National rent a fish to rent like that you know I wish we but if we I mean if no fish are biting which might just happen yeah we'd be in trouble we might not be able to make it onto our flight to Phoenix all right so it's officially been two hours yeah I mean we've had a good time and earned 300 for that here's the deal we need almost exactly 2625 Singaporean dollars to book that flight to JFK and we have 400. we have 400 so we need about 75 each time in the numbers and if we get it one time we have the money to do it I'll be on the math do you think that's what we do we just I think we just needed about 7 75 on 17 each time all right [Music] I don't see how this could ever go wrong right no not at all I mean what else has gone wrong today nothing yeah of course all right we'll get them next time right it was a good practice reaction over this time right that is not 17. it's all black though time we'll get him this time right yeah I'll hit him this time it's fine we'll get in this time right I mean we'll get them this time we got to this is the last one all we gotta do I mean we're going to win it this time yes of course that's what's in the script right yeah you're not supposed to say that Tim why do you spoil it yeah I like that skin that was a good spin it was robust that is not 17. it's fine we have 25 bucks left we put 25 on 17. we've been on 17 and then we put everything else on 17 and get back up to 2600 right yeah let's do it perfect strategy we'll get them this time [Music] well Joseph I'm sorry to say it but I think we might have just lost jet lag the game I think we can finally admit that we have probably lost So Adam and Ben wherever you are um We're not gonna tell you we're not gonna tell them that we've lost We're not gonna say but wherever you're at we just have no way of leaving Singapore yeah we're stuck without just ending up stuck in Seoul airport which they wouldn't let us do because you can't we don't have an exit floor yeah we can't fly there unless we have a flight Beyond which we can I think I think we've been checkmated no way one more round if we had had like if we had oh my God literally the next one was 17 guys with that loss Joseph and I are trapped in Singapore for the rest of the game there's no way through grinding challenges or gambling for us to make the money before the last flight of the night we are well and truly screwed but Ben and Adam aren't out of the woods yet with limited challenges left 370 dollars in the bank and only 37 hours left to get the remaining 8 325 miles back to Denver they're going to need everything to go right from here on out to get back before the clock hits 100 hours [Music] thank you okay so we just got in it's about nine a.m our flight got in late we have to get on a flight at about 1 15 and before that we need to earn 800 800 so we've decided that we are going to catch a fish uh so step one of that means we have to go buy a fishing rod we have to apply for our fishing license yeah we're getting a fishing license okay we are now licensed to fish in Australia so that's good no uh challenges from Sam Joseph I haven't heard from them in a while probably on a long flight presumably cut to them on a flight well I mean Singapore I love you but I hate you yeah I kind of I kind of hate student Port right now honestly we came here and we've just had L after l i mean all we could do is have fun we couldn't even find liquor maybe we find liquor we got the Michelin Star Rob from us we got the bungee jumper up from us congrats to Ben and Adam hopefully their plane just gets like diverted to Midway Island or something and they get stuck there for days and and then we can I don't know what we would do then I mean we still don't have we still have no way to earn we are totally hacked we're done so I think we're done so we've done so we're gonna find some food we haven't eaten since like breakfast and just I don't know drink what just drown our sorrows out so yeah congrats bending how to thank you goodbye [Music] welcome thank you thank you we're looking for like the cheapest cheapest fishing rod you have but at least still work really good one uh uh do you want to start our package stickers that'd be great yeah we're from from yeah from New York New York oh I spent my honeymoon oh incredible let's try this more pack of prawn I mean 91.35 perfect thank you have a good one all right that was pretty efficient [Music] wonderful thank you so much all right buddy let's catch a fish [Music] okay and with a lot of confidence turns out that confidence from this place [Music] [Music] excuse me have you bought any fish today [Music] I did not know that fishing could be this stressful it happens again [Music] I think it's all about the end all right we can do this [Music] any luck they're like little minnows down there right I think so [Music] are you getting this I mean this is beautiful here yep oh man we made a huge mistake and just massive I just imagined the ocean around Australia full of beautiful exotic fish yeah I sure did that we could snatch out of the water at a moment's notice but there are none not a one there's like two actual Fisher guys who have been there for hours and they haven't caught them so how would we test that normally the answer is keeping up I could try and jump into the water over there where the minnows are and just thrash around like it's not the worst up here no it's not are those minnows yeah those are [Music] I think we need to dive in okay I'll do it sure you don't want me to do it I'll do it hopefully I'll just go into my underwear yeah wait then [Music] oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God [Music] look that's a fish we have caught the tiniest fish in the whole world [Music] oh my god oh I was about to jump into the water you know here is this one think of the content that you're missing out on you gotta go backwards too I'm gonna go put my shoes on we did it I cannot believe it [Music] [ __ ] our onward flights to La thank you thank you [Music] foreign [Music] one thing we fail to consider is that this is the southern hemisphere which means that it's winter now which means that at 7 pm it's pitch black out uh attempting to jump into the ocean for a shell with kill us be back um do you know that they actually like bottled this stuff in Fiji and then ship it other places isn't that crazy yeah I mean isn't that exactly what it says that they do like did you think that I don't know did you think that Fiji Water didn't come from Fiji I just thought it was like a brand like it was the vibe of the water was Fiji it was sort of Fiji vibe why would they ship it from here it's the same thing just the whole point of the water is that it's water from Fiji that's why it's called the beachy water it literally says from the islands of Fijian that's not that doesn't appeal to me at all all right back to America we're realizing it's been what like 28 hours since Sam and Joseph have completed a challenge yeah I mean they're either like in jail or they're about to win yeah it's definitely one of the two let's hope they're in jail [Music] there are signs pointing three different ways for taxi this one says go that way this one says go that way that one says go this way build a Subway idiots there's a 4 30 flight to Denver that we really really really want to make because if we don't make it then we have to wait another two and a half hours until then too late which is also much more expensive so we only need like 80 more dollars to buy this flight so we're doing the cheapest challenge that's left which is get drunk on a local liquor now that we're back in the United States that liquor is going to be Bourbon and we are heading to the Santa Monica Pier as fast as we possibly can to get drunk let's go [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] here we go again when we're doing this two Series in a row I hope you didn't find it it's Tradition now for us to do this last one all right okay get it down before you go a big game [Music] uh yeah three and a baby that's 300 that's enough to make our flight to Denver time to go thank you all right Santa Monica Pier yeah oh actually our car's gonna be here for four minutes so here I'm just gonna Sprint here okay I'm gonna show everyone Santa Monica Pierre [Music] buildings now we gotta go we got a book the tickets before we're too drunk all right let's book those tickets that's flight books last free books yeah [Music] how you feeling [Music] my body has nothing but Bourbon and peanut butter cracker are you drunk um I'm I'm pretty much fine right now it takes a little while for shots to kick in for me okay and we're still playing the game these are the challenge in over 24 hours so gameplay might be in jail or something I don't know [Music] if what would happen if he died all right ah let's absolutely do it buddy this way all right hey buddy food's almost ready got you I got you a drink here I didn't know what you wanted I got you a Diet Coke I love the coke
